<s n="s1.7;p1.16">Etymologically, autonomy can be traced back to the Greek <hi rend="italic">'autos'</hi> and '<hi rend="italic">nomos'</hi>, 'self' and 'law'. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.16">The autonomous give the law to themselves, determine the principles by which they live. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.16">The question of autonomy is linked with that of freedom. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.16">One is autonomous, one may believe, if one's actions are determined by one's self rather than causes external to one's self. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.16">One may also wish to claim one is free on the same grounds. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.16">Clearly, one's conception of autonomy must rely upon one's conception of the self as well as on one's understanding of causality. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.16">The marked differences between Kant's and Nietzsche's understanding of the self and of causality are at the root of both philosopher's conceptions of autonomy and their different conclusions about freedom. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.16">Kant's treatment of human freedom takes its root in his transcendental idealism. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.16">The latter holds that the world of experience is not a guide to the constitution of the world as it would be absent a subject. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.16">Kant's critical philosophy is designed to show the conditions of the possibility of our experience, 'to lime the limits of our world' in Quine's phrase, where those limits do not describe what exists but what exists in so far as it appears to us. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.2;p3.16">As reconstructed by Henry Allison, Kant's arguments show that human freedom is an idea with a regulative function.<ref target="BAWE_0390c-ftnote.001"/> Kant shows (a) the feasibility, granted transcendental idealism, of there being two causal descriptions of the one event, one empirical description - in accordance with the principles of causality as they form a world for us - and one transcendental description - in which the event is seen as grounded in the world outside the conditions of the possibility of experience; and (b) that if we are to understand ourselves as rational agents we must think of ourselves as free - we must take the second of the two descriptions to be tenable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.16">Although this reading is not universally accepted amongst commentators, I shall take it as the basis of my comparison on the grounds that it shows intriguing relations to Nietzsche's conception of autonomy, most specifically regarding the question of providing principles for one's own actions.<ref target="BAWE_0390c-ftnote.002"/> As a regulative idea, our freedom conditions our actions: we act in such a way that takes it to be true, even though it is undecidable whether it is. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p4.16">Kant affirms the validity of the principle of causality within experience. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.16">Our experience necessarily displays to us causal relations between representations. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.16">If the human agent is governed by the same category such a conception would typically be said to allow for no freedom. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.16">If a human being's actions are determined by causal connections between them and other states of the physical universe then, one might say, they cannot be free. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.16">The traditional conception of freedom, in contrast, would then hold that reason allows the human being to deliberate freely about his actions and to choose without determining compulsion. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.16">Here reason is seen as situated outside the causal network. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.16">A decision that is rational is not determined by other states of the causally determined world. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.16">Kant does not follow this picture in describing his idea of freedom, instead distinguishing between our empirical and intelligible characters which we shall now examine. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.16">However, Nietzsche feels able to level the same criticisms (and some new ones) against Kant that he does at the traditional picture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.14;p5.16">For Kant, one's empirical character is defined by the types of actions one does. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p5.16">From a given individual's actions we can infer to a number of principles or maxims they live by. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p5.16">In other words, one's actions are explicable by one's psychological states linked by rational inferences. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p5.16">Such a picture is strongly reminiscent of the 'folk psychology' theories of recent decades.<ref target="BAWE_0390c-ftnote.003"/> Such theories hold that one can explain actions by beliefs, desires and other such states linked by reasoning to actions. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p5.16">Such principles apply on these theories: 'if I believe that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will produce F then I will do <hi rend="italic">a</hi> unless <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> will produce F and also G, which I also take to be desirable'. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p5.16">What is distinctive about Kant's theory is the character of the 'oughts' that are taken to play such an important role. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p5.16">A 'folk psychologist' might gloss all 'oughts' as desires - a procedure Nietzsche would be inclined to as we shall later see - whereas for Kant it is the specific nature of the oughts that allows for the efficacy of the intelligible character. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p5.16">For Kant a desire is not sufficient to produce a reason for acting. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p5.16">A spontaneous adoption of a rule or principle of action is needed. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p5.16">The reasoning is as follows: Kant holds that to think of ourselves as rational requires that we accept the spontaneity of thought that is necessitated for our taking a certain reason as a reason for an action. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p5.16">In other words, the choice of a certain reason requires a spontaneous act of thought. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p5.16">However, one can only choose a reason as a reason if one holds to an ought. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p5.16">I desire food, but I will only have a reason for acting if I also hold that I ought to eat (perhaps in order to survive). </s>
