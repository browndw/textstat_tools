<s n="s1.1;p1.34">In this essay I will be looking at how the formal properties of Joseph Conrad's <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> (1899) and Ford Madox Ford's <hi rend="italic"> The Good Soldier</hi> (1915) give order and articulation to the experience of modern life. </s>

<p n="p2.34">
<s n="s1.1;p2.34">The word 'form' implies a structuring of some kind, and, when applied to literature, the formal properties of a work 'usually refer to its structural design and patterning, or sometimes to its style and manner in a wider sense, as distinct from its content.<ref target="BAWE_3158a-ftnote.001"/>' So what are the structural designs of both Ford and Conrad's works? </s>

<s n="s2.4;p3.34">The piece is too short to be a novel, and so can be termed a 'novella', described as 'a fictional tale in prose, intermediate in length and complexity between a short story and a novel, and usually concentrating on a single event or chain of events, with a surprising turning point.<ref target="BAWE_3158a-ftnote.002"/>' The structural design of <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> embodies that of a novel, '...an extended fictional prose narrative'<ref target="BAWE_3158a-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.34">Greater in length than the novella, the novel 'permits fuller, subtler development of characters and themes'. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p4.34">So both <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> utilise traditional realist structural designs (i.e. the novel and the novella) and outwardly suggest an agreement with realism, 'a mode of writing that gives the impression of recording or "reflecting" faithfully on actual way of life'<ref target="BAWE_3158a-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
