<s n="s1.3;p53.60">Downing and Locke distinguish between two main types of determination: deictic and quantifying (Downing and Locke 2002:436). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p53.60">These two groups are divided into various subtypes, and deictic determiners can also be divided into specific and non-specific. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p53.60">Huddleston (1984:354-399), on the other hand, distinguishes the articles from 14 types of "other" determinatives, with exact, but rather small categories like "alternative-additive determinative" (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) and "positive paucal determinatives" (<hi rend="italic">a little</hi> etc.) </s>

<s n="s1.4;p54.60">A lot of efforts have been made to categorise determiners according to their semantics. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p54.60">The grammatical behaviour of such categories has mainly been linked to the position of their members within the noun group. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p54.60">Berk (1999:58) and Quirkal. (1985:256) have published an account of which type of noun head can be specified by which types of determiners. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p54.60">However, it only gives information on which determiners occur with singular count, plural count and/or noncount nouns, and these co-occurrences are not linked with a coherent semantic parallel. </s>

<p n="p55.60">
<s n="s1.3;p55.60">The only semantic classes that display a distinct grammatical behaviour seem to be the types outlined in section 2.1. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p55.60">The position of articles, genitives, demonstratives and interrogatives in the noun group is fixed: they occupy the central position amongst the elements before any epithets, classifiers and the head noun. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p55.60">Quantifiers however can be found in all three determiner positions, although the central position can only host exact quantifiers like <hi rend="italic">no</hi>, <hi rend="italic">each</hi>, <hi rend="italic">every</hi> and <hi rend="italic">any</hi>. </s>

<p n="p56.60">
<s n="s1.1;p56.60">The quantifiers <hi rend="italic">all</hi> and <hi rend="italic">both</hi>, which are normally found in predeterminer position, can sometimes move into the verb group ('quantifier float') (Berk 1999:66). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p59.60">The answer to the first essay question, "How do we distinguish determiners from other elements that premodify nouns in English?", has shown that there are relatively reliable checks to distinguish between determiners and other prenominal modifiers. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p59.60">Section 2 however, dedicated to the second essay question, has shown that distinguishing between different semantic classes within the determiner category is not a question of clear-cut boundaries and obvious perspectives. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p59.60">But it is possible to point out some "semantic classes of determiners that behave in grammatically distinct ways", at least as to their typical position in the noun phrase. </s>
