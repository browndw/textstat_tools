<s n="s2.7;p17.76">The potential effect of this magnetic field causes a rotating magnetic flux that flows through each of the stator cores (set at 120 deg in 3 phase motor) and it's this rotating flux that induces the magnetised 4-pole rotor inside the 3 coils to react and hence rotate. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p22.76">This was because the rotor was locked and not free to react to the rotating magnetic flux in the stator, so the flux induced current flow in the rotor circuit. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p22.76">The Voltage supplied to the motor was 55V. This measured Voltage is much reduced from the normal (rated) operating voltage of 220V at 3Amps. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p22.76">The line voltage (Potential difference) dropped significantly during the test because a large majority of the current energy flowing through the stator coils was not being used to rotate the rotor via the rotor inductors cutting the stator coils flux. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.76">So the potential difference (V <hi rend="sub">Supply</hi>) was less (55V) than when the rotor rotates at the full speed of near 1500rpm at 220V. At this speed the rotor would be extracting a lot of induced energy out of the flux, hence more current energy is consumed in the stator coils and the potential difference is therefore greater (220V). </s>
