<s n="s9.19;p2.6">(Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Theogony</hi> 177- 182). </s>
<s n="s10.19;p2.6">This extreme birth was caused by the fathers will not to be surpassed by any of his children. </s>
<s n="s11.19;p2.6">This "ruthless struggle for power, a complete absence of moral standards and lawlessness..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_6118d-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s12.19;p2.6">is a popular reoccurring theme in myth as male gods especially, try to control and manipulate birth. </s>
<s n="s13.19;p2.6">Like his father Ouranos, Kronos is also incapable of controlling this force of nature forever. </s>
<s n="s14.19;p2.6">However before that is discussed, Hesiod adds another miraculous birth to the escape of the children from Gaia. </s>
<s n="s15.19;p2.6">"And even as at first he cut of the privy parts with the adamant, and hurled them...into the foaming sea...therein a maiden grew... </s>

<s n="s10.21;p3.6">They tell him that a child of Metis will have the wisdom to do so<ref target="BAWE_6118d-ftnote.002"/>. </s>

<s n="s13.21;p3.6">"From his august head, cunning Zeus himself gave birth to her (Athena), born in warlike armour of gleaming gold"<ref target="BAWE_6118d-ftnote.003"/> The prophecy of a new leader could no longer come true, as this child was not born from Metis but from Zeus 'alone'. </s>
<s n="s14.21;p3.6">Therefore Zeus was the only leader of the immortals not to be overthrown. </s>
<s n="s15.21;p3.6">Again also the theme of single parenthood arises. </s>
<s n="s16.21;p3.6">It is something only the gods can do. </s>
<s n="s17.21;p3.6">The previous two cases have been of males taking over the birthing process to an extent; it was not of Ouranos's free will that Aphrodite was born. </s>
<s n="s18.21;p3.6">Perhaps this is another reason why the gods should be revered. </s>
<s n="s19.21;p3.6">They could give birth without the need of the female. </s>
<s n="s20.21;p3.6">This was somewhat a universal wish of men, to be able to have children without the need for the trouble and toil a wife can bring<ref target="BAWE_6118d-ftnote.004"/>. </s>

<s n="s11.16;p4.6">There are discrepancies about where the 'second birth' of Dionysus takes place. </s>

<s n="s13.16;p4.6">This supports the promoted idea that Dionysus was a god from the East. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p4.6">Why is this important? </s>
<s n="s15.16;p4.6">This version may have been created because the Greeks did not want what he stood for to be Greek. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p4.6">The god of intoxication and wine did not promote the diplomatic, cultured atmosphere that Greece was perhaps trying to radiate at the time? </s>

<s n="s18.19;p5.6">Birth during stories where metamorphoses has occurred, for example in Prometheus Bound, the child arrives while the female is still in her altered state; in this case Io was transformed into a cow. </s>
