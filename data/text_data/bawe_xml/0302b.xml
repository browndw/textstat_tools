<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.006"/>

<s n="s1.7;p3.10">Where the Americans lacked money or resources they made up for it in strong leadership, whereas the British attempted to rely on brute force rather than military intelligence or ingenuity. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.10">Washington, for example, had a consistent lack of co- operation from Congress, could rely on no more than 5,000 regular soldiers, and suffered many defeats such as at Brandywine Creek in September 1777. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.10">Despite this he showed great determination, persistence and originality. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.10">For example, through Benjamin Franklin he set up one of the best intelligence services in American history, confusing the British by leaking "inflated reports on the strength of his army." </s>

<s n="s5.7;p3.10">In addition to Washington, "remarkable military"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.008"/> men such as Greene, Knox, Morgan and Arnold were supported by foreign volunteers such as Steuben and Lafayette. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.10">Together they ensured that the American army survived such hardships as the march to Quebec, the crossing of the Delaware, and Greene's forced marches in the southern campaign. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p4.10">Strong leadership in America motivated the American people to have a strong desire to win the war. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.10">The Americans had many reasons to dislike the British; "taxation... a 'standing army'.... </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.10">The importation of tea.... [and] the Coercive Acts." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s4.10;p4.10">This resulted in such protest groups as the Sons of Liberty. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.10">Thomas Paine expressed what many Americans were thinking in his Common Sense pamphlet declaring that British 'corruption' was "poisoning the New World." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s6.10;p4.10">This instigated widespread discussion encouraging a defiant mood against the British. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.10">When the Americans were fighting, they were doing so to defend their families and homes, further encouraging patriotism and determination to succeed. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.10">The British, on the other hand, were fighting as professional soldiers for little personal gain. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.10">Additionally, they lacked widespread support back home as many British citizens were sympathetic to the cause of the Americans. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.10">Though a similar trend was apparent in America with a third of Americans opposing the Revolution and even, in 1779, more Americans fighting with the British (there were approximately 21 regiments of loyalists in the British army as opposed Washington's field army of 3,468<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.011"/>) than their home country, the advantages that the Americans had fighting in their own country outweighed the opposition. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.10">An example of this is the fact that the Americans were fighting in terrain that they knew, enabling them to formulate plans and react to situations based on more comprehensive knowledge than the British, who were trying to direct operations from a great distance, had. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.10">Additionally, the Americans were more used to the weather conditions and able to use it to their advantage to devise plans based on land and terrain. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.10">The British, on the other hand, had to rely on sheer numbers rather than extensive knowledge. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.10">Their maps were often inaccurate and communications difficult, especially for the messengers who were easy targets in their bright red uniforms. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.10">Furthermore, Franklin and Washington's intelligence service meant that the colonists often knew of the British plans before the British generals. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.10">Therefore by fighting in their own country the colonists were at an immediate advantage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.10">
<s n="s1.7;p6.10">America used this advantage to make up for the British having superior numbers of troops. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p6.10">They fought what military historian Russell Weigley calls "the strategy of erosion"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.012"/> which avoided set- piece battles. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p6.10">Between them, they "demoralised the British forces without ever defeating them in a set- piece battle." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s6.7;p6.10">Washington was a military conservative so his tactical innovations were not radical, the guerrilla warfare emanating more from "circumstances over which they had no control"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.014"/> than a product of design. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.10">As has been repeated through history (for example in Vietnam and, more recently, Iraq), however, it did ensure that the American troops had a higher chance of winning against greater numbers of troops. </s>

<s n="s1.13;p7.10">The Americans did have outside help, however. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p7.10">At the beginning of the war this was little more than French aid such as money and supplies; most of the muskets, bayonets, and cannon used by the Continental Army came from France, for example. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p7.10">In the final stages of the war, however, they also provided military help. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s5.13;p7.10">Additionally, the thirty- seven French ships- of- the line played a crucial role in trapping the 8,700 strong British army. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p7.10">Britain also had opposition from Spain who, as part of the Family Contract and also to obtain revenge declared war in 1779, and Holland who declared war in 1780 because the Royal Navy insisted on searching neutral ships. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p7.10">This was followed later that year by Prussia, the Holy Roman Emperor, the Portuguese in 1782 and, in 1783, the Kingdom of Naples. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p7.10">Though not all conflict was for the American cause, each caused distractions and diversions of British troops and supplies which would otherwise have been directed at America. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p7.10">Britain's search for an ally, on the other hand, was undermined in part by its own failures. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p7.10">"Political instability, urban and radical unrest, and mounting colonial problems"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.016"/> during the 1760s damaged Britain's standing in Europe. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p7.10">This encouraged what Samuel Adams described as "the marshalling against England of European powers." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s12.13;p7.10">Despite courting Prussia, Austria and Russia- even offering Catherine II the Mediterranean island of Minorca in return for an immediate treaty, no attempt was successful, highlighting "Britain's diplomatic isolation." </s>

<s n="s13.13;p7.10">Though, as Scott points out, Britain was not defeated "because it lacked a Continental ally,"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.019"/> the presence of allies on the American side was not only beneficial but also one of the deciding factors in their success. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p8.10">Furthermore, Lord North's government was troubled by affairs in Ireland in 1773 following the Dublin Parliament's proposition of an Absentee Land Tax. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p8.10">Additionally, following the establishment of Christopher Wyvill's County Association in 1779 North had to deal with the demands of the "English provincial country gentlemen"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.020"/> as well as the Gordon Riots of 1780. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s7.8;p8.10">This gave the public a voice of opposition against the war which could be expressed not only through politicians such as Fox and Burke. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p9.10">It is likely that a key source of the British dissatisfaction with the war was the cost. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p9.10">This not only worsened conditions for the troops with reduced rations, but also cost the British Government a lot with the national debt increasing from £127 million to £232 million over the course of the conflict. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.10">Washington suffered similar problems with funding. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.10">Unable to tax, however, Congress "borrowed approximately $16 million, collected around $5.5million from the states, and printed some $240 million in paper notes"<ref target="BAWE_0302b-ftnote.023"/> which soon became worthless. </s>
