<s n="s3.4;p1.87">A gearbox takes an input shaft rotating and converts it via a gear train into up to three outputs, the process of designing a gearbox is to figure out which ratios are needed and to implement those ratios in the form of positioning various sizes of connected gears. </s>

<p n="p3.87">
<s n="s1.3;p3.87">In this design, firstly, the gear ration was decided, and a specimen manual calculation was taken to check bending and surface stress, the result was compared with Gears Program. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.87">After that, according to the calculated gear teeth loads, the design of shaft and bearings were discussed. </s>
