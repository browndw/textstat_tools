<s n="s1.4;p1.151">When first considering an area of study for this module, numerous subjects initially came to my attention, although I had a vague familiarity with the majority as a result of my previous degree. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.151">Then it struck me that within my time at medical school, I had already met several patients with histories of breast carcinoma during other aspects of the course and yet I knew virtually nothing about this condition. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.151">Whilst discussing this with colleagues it soon became apparent that unlike most people, I had never had first hand experience of people suffering from breast cancer as fortunately I knew of no family members or friends who had undergone the trauma of a diagnosis. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.151">I found this quite surprising given the high rates of incidence, and therefore decided to use this opportunity to gain an insight into the disease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.151">
<s n="s1.2;p2.151">Once I began investigating the condition further, it immediately struck me that I was going to have a difficult job ahead of me, purely due to the sheer volume of literature which appeared to be available. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.151">From the outset I had decided that a general overview would be most beneficial, although as I my interest grew, it became increasingly difficult to maintain this ideal as I found myself focusing upon fascinating, albeit obscure aspects of breast cancer research. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.151">
<s n="s1.3;p3.151">I feel I have gained a great deal from this module, as it has increased my clinical understanding of this condition and furthered my interest into this diverse area of medical research. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.151">In addition, it has also allowed me to gain a better appreciation of the range of emotional effects it may have upon the patients themselves. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.151">I sincerely believe that this knowledge base will be of great value in future, particularly when discussing what may be an uncomfortable topic for many patients. </s>

<p n="p4.151">
<s n="s1.4;p4.151">An estimated 1 in 3 people will develop cancer during the course of their lives, of which the four most common cancers - breast, lung, colorectal and prostate - account for over half of the 270,000 new cases of malignant cancer registered each year (1). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.151">For many years, breast cancer has been the most common cancer amongst women. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.151">With over 41,000 new cases being diagnosed each year, it accounts for one in three of all female cancer cases and the lifetime risk for developing breast cancer is estimated to be as high in one in nine. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.151">It is therefore unsurprising that breast cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer mortality in the UK, with figures suggesting that 12,000 women die of breast cancer each year (Figure 1.1) (2). </s>

</figure>
<p n="p5.151">
<s n="s1.2;p5.151">Furthermore, an even greater number of women present to their doctor each year concerned about malignancy as a result of breast lumps, despite the fact that 90% of these symptoms arise from benign lesions (2). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.151">In addition, the success of media campaigns and advertisements over the past 20 years aimed at raising breast cancer awareness has lead to even greater levels of women seeking medical assistance (3). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.151">
<s n="s1.3;p6.151">As a result of these trends medical professionals are coming into contact with patients concerned about breast cancer more frequently. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.151">It is therefore important that practitioners are able to develop an understanding of the disease processes involved so they can competently identify possible malignancies when necessary. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.151">In addition, they must also be aware of the varied psychological implications breast disease may have upon the patients presenting to them, irrespective of whether or not their initial fear of malignancy is justified. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.151">
<s n="s1.6;p7.151">The aim of this dissertation is to provide a broad overview of the major features associated with breast cancer in women. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.151">It will start by examining the normal breast anatomy and physiology, the pathological processes involved, the clinical features of the disease and the methods by which can be detected and diagnosed. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.151">The available treatment options and prognosis will subsequently be discussed. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.151">Various social and psychological issues are also associated with breast cancer particularly with regard to screening, diagnosis and treatment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.151">These issues will be highlighted and discussed where appropriate. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.151">Additional patient case studies will also be used to address more specific social and psychological problems which may be faced by patients. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.151">
<s n="s1.4;p8.151">It is important to appreciate at this stage that certain important omissions will unfortunately be made due to the limited coverage available. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.151">As mentioned above benign breast diseases account for a large proportion of breast masses, however these will not be discussed in further detail despite their significance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.151">Although a comparatively rare phenomenon, carcinoma of the breast may also present in males, however given the rarity of this condition it too will not be discussed in the following dissertation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.151">Finally, the numerous complications which may occur as a result of breast cancer, metastatic disease and the medical and surgical interventions used will not be discussed due to the extent of this topic. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">2. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</head>
<p n="p9.151">
<s n="s1.10;p9.151">The breast represents a down-growth of the epidermis which usually only develops significantly in females (4). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p9.151">The main structures contained within the breast tissue are the mammary glands which are involved in the production and expression of milk. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p9.151">These glands therefore represent an important accessory to reproduction in women (5). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p9.151">The mammary gland is attached to the dermis of the overlying skin by the suspensory ligaments of the breast. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p9.151">These ligaments represent thickenings in the connective tissue stroma, and are particularly prominent in superior part of the breast in order to provide support for the glandular lobules. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p9.151">At its posterior margin, the circular base of the breast rests on the deep pectoral fascia overlying pectoralis major and serratus anterior, there is however a loose connective tissue plane between these two structures which gives rise to the retromammary space. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p9.151">This is a potential space which contains a small amount of fat and therefore permits movement of the breast over the fascial layer. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.151">The base of the breast extends transversely from the lateral sternal border to the mid axillary line (MAL) and vertically from the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> to 6 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> ribs, but the gland also extends laterally towards the axilla forming the axillary tail. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p9.151">The mammary glands are highly vascular, being supplied by perforating branches of the subclavian and axillary arteries (Figure 2.1). </s>
<s n="s10.10;p9.151">In addition they also receive arterial blood from the thoracic aorta via the posterior intercostal arteries which enter the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi>, 3 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> and 4 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> intercostal spaces (6). </s>

<s n="s1.1;p10.151">Venous drainage of the breast is primarily to the axillary vein, although the internal thoracic veins are also involved (Figure 2.2). </s>

<p n="p11.151">
<s n="s1.5;p11.151">An understanding of the lymphatic supply of the breast is highly important, due to the role it plays in metastatic cancer (Figure 2.3). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.151">The subareolar lymphatic plexus receives drainage from the nipple, areola and lobules. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.151">The majority of lymph from this region originates from the lateral breast quadrants and drains into the axillary lymph nodes and accessory nodes such as the interpectoral, deltopectoral, supraclavicular or inferior deep cervical nodes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.151">In contrast, lymph from the medial quadrants drains to either the parasternal nodes or the opposite breast. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.151">Lymph from the lower quadrants may also pass inferiorly to the phrenic (abdominal) nodes (6). </s>

<p n="p12.151">
<s n="s1.5;p12.151">Prior to puberty the breast lacks any form of glandular tissue, exhibiting only a few small ducts connected to the nipple. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.151">With the onset of thelarche (breast development) there is increased deposition of fat and connective tissue, and the ducts also increase in length and begin to branch, forming terminal buds. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.151">Further breast growth and glandular development occurs with the onset of menses, in response to the associated hormonal changes and continues until the age of 25. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.151">This developmental process is primarily regulated by the interaction of oestrogen, progesterone and prolactin levels, however several other hormones are also believed to have a minor role (Figure 2.4). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.151">It has been difficult to determine the precise role of each hormone since they may have both growth and secretory effects; however this process is evidently accelerated by pregnancy during this period (5). </s>

<s n="s1.7;p13.151">As a result of its role in milk production, the structure of the mammary gland is best described during pregnancy as it only during this period that the tissue is fully functional. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.151">Like most compound glands the structure of the gland can be thought to consist of lobes, lobules and ducts (Figure 2.5). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.151">Each lobe contains a branching duct system that extends into the fibroadipose tissue of the breast, terminating in groups of lobules. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.151">The lobules represent the secretory units, which contain of a variable number of acini surrounded by loose connective tissue. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.151">Each acinus is composed of epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells, which have secretory and mechanical functions respectively. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.151">The main role of the epithelial cells is secretion of milk during later pregnancy and post-partum; however they also continuously secrete various glycoproteins into the glandular lumen. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.151">In contrast the myoepithelial cells form a discontinuous layer, which surrounds the basement membrane, and contain contractile proteins which promote passage of the secretions through the duct system (5). </s>

</figure>
<p n="p14.151">
<s n="s1.5;p14.151">The groups of lobules associated with each lobe are connected via a series of intra and extra-lobular ducts to an individual lactiferous duct which subsequently empties onto the surface of the breast. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.151">There are approximately 15-20 lactiferous ducts, each draining a segment of the breast, which converge towards the centre of the nipple like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.151">Before opening at the nipple, each duct exhibits a lactiferous sinus which permits the accumulation of milk in the lactating mother. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.151">The nipple itself contains connective tissue and smooth muscle cells which allow the formation of a circular sphincter. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.151">The area surrounding the nipple, known as the areola, also contains numerous sebaceous glands which enlarge during pregnancy and secrete an oily substance to protect against irritation and chaffing which may occur when nursing (5). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.151">
<s n="s1.4;p15.151">In the non-pregnant state (i.e. when lactation is not occurring), the lactiferous ducts end in a group of blind, saccular evaginations which exhibit relatively few, if any, lobules. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.151">The most noticeable characteristic of breast tissue during pregnancy is therefore the formation of lobules and lobes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.151">It is this development of glandular tissue along with increased fat deposition which results in the breast enlargement associated with pregnancy. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.151">Following pregnancy, further adipose tissue replaces the lobular alveolar tissue (4). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.151">
<s n="s1.6;p16.151">The breast also undergoes minor changes during each menstrual cycle, in response to the variations which occur in the circulating levels of sex steroids (Figure 2.6). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p16.151">During the post-ovulation secretory phase, the rising oestrogen and gonadotrophin (e.g. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p16.151">LH and FSH) levels cause the lobular stroma to become oedematous, resulting in breast enlargement and the sensation of tenderness that is often experienced prior to menstruation. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p16.151">In addition both progesterone and oestrogen promote cell division mitosis during this period, and although subsequent apoptosis ensures the overall balance is maintained, it may cause temporary lumpiness of the breast. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.151">It is important to appreciate these normal physiological changes and the times at which they occur in order to provide reassurance to concerned patients. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p16.151">As a result however, it is usually beneficial to examine the breasts of pre-menopausal women in the first half of the cycle (5). </s>

<p n="p17.151">
<s n="s1.4;p17.151">With increasing age, breast tissue also undergoes changes due to the altered sex steroid levels, which accompany decreasing ovarian function. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.151">For example, the connective tissue of the lobules changes from a loose to a dense structure, the basement membrane thickens and the cells lining the acini are lost (5). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.151">These changes start during the pre-menopausal period and continue past the menopause, until old age is reached by which point the breast is primarily composed of adipose tissue. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.151">Importantly these changes occur at an uneven rate which frequently results in clinically palpable lumps (8). </s>

<p n="p18.151">
<s n="s1.4;p18.151">Given the high incidence rates, it is not surprising that there has been significant research interest in the aetiological mechanisms associated with the development of breast carcinoma. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.151">As a result, numerous risk factors have been identified which correlate with an increased risk of pathogenesis. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.151">In most cases it is uncertain whether the individual factors act as initiators or promoters, due to the complex interactions between them (5). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.151">Some of these factors will be examined below. </s>
</p>

<head rend="underlined bold">3.1 Risk Factors</head>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">Gender and Age</head>
<p n="p19.151">
<s n="s1.3;p19.151">The single biggest risk factor for developing breast carcinoma is being female, as less than 1% of carcinomas occur in males and although this aspect will not be discussed further, it is undoubtedly important to be aware of this fact especially if presented with a concerned male patient. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.151">The incidence of breast carcinoma, as with most other malignancies, increases with age. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.151">In particular there is a rapid increase which can be observed between the ages of 45-50 (5). </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">Family History of Breast Cancer</head>
<p n="p20.151">
<s n="s1.4;p20.151">Another important risk factor is to ascertain is whether there is any evidence of breast cancer in first degree relatives for example in the mother or sisters. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.151">Particular interest should be made to relatives who developed the disease prior to the menopause, as this strongly suggests an underlying genetic basis. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.151">Approximately 10% of breast cancer is due to genetic predisposition (9). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.151">Genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is generally inherited as an autosomal dominant trait exhibiting limited penetrance, it can therefore be transmitted through either sex, although it may not necessarily manifest in the phenotype of all carriers (10). </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.151">
<s n="s1.6;p21.151">Two major susceptibility genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, have been identified to date. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p21.151">About one-third of familial cases exhibit mutations in the tumour suppressor gene BRCA1 which is located on the long arm of chromosome 17. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p21.151">Over 200 mutations have been described in BRCA1, some of which are associated with different risks, in particular distal mutations are almost exclusively associated with breast cancer, whilst those occurring early in the gene predispose to ovarian and breast cancer. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p21.151">As a result of the latter, BRCA1 is responsible for almost all families with a susceptibility to both ovarian and breast cancer. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p21.151">The second hereditary locus, BRCA2, is found on the long arm of chromosome 13 and is typically associated with families with early onset or male breast cancer (10). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p21.151">In both cases, early detection is essential as up to 90% of patients will survive if the malignancy is found at an early stage (11). </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.151">
<s n="s1.5;p22.151">In addition, abnormalities in the p53 tumour suppressor gene have also been linked to malignancy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p22.151">For example, up to 40% of sporadic tumours exhibit p53 mutations (9). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p22.151">Mutations have also been identified in rare conditions such as Li-fraumeni syndrome, in which there is an association between sarcomas, brain tumours and early onset breast cancer. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p22.151">Although collectively these genes account for a significant proportion of breast carcinomas, there are undoubtedly further genes conferring susceptibility which have yet to be discovered. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.151">It is also important to remember that despite the association with these individual mutations, a proportion of cancers arising in those with genetic factors are still likely to be sporadic (5). </s>

<div3>
<head rend="underlined">Age at Key Reproductive Stages</head>
<p n="p23.151">
<s n="s1.7;p23.151">The risk of developing breast cancer is also significantly higher amongst women experiencing either an early menarche or a late menopause, therefore attention to these elements of the reproductive history is particularly important. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.151">For example women experiencing the menopause after the age of 55, have twice the risk of developing carcinoma in comparison with those reaching it before 45. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.151">It therefore becomes apparent that extended menstrual activity can have a significant effect. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.151">Parity has also been demonstrated to be associated with breast cancer development. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.151">In general, pregnancy is believed to confer some protection, which is related to the age at which the first birth occurs. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.151">Those who delayed their pregnancy until they entered their thirties were at twice the risk compared to teenage mothers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.151">Nulliparous women also have an increased lifetime incidence of breast cancer, however the risk is greater amongst women delaying the first birth until their mid to late thirties (5). </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.151">
<s n="s1.3;p24.151">The association of breast cancer risk with menarche, menopause and first full time pregnancy indicates that hormones may have a role in development of carcinomas, however they are much more likely to be promoters than initiators. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.151">Oestrogen activity appears to be most important hormonal factor, in particular overexposure to oestrogens and under-exposure to progesterone are associated with increased risk. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.151">For example, early menarche and late menopause will both result in a greater number of menstrual cycles, which will subsequently prolong the period over which the tissue is exposed to the stimulatory oestrogen surges (5). </s>

<s n="s2.3;p141.151">She also reported frequent ankle swelling which is exacerbated by warm weather. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p141.151">She also experiences photosensitivity of the skin, presumably a side effect of her current drug regime which includes amiodarone. </s>
</p>
<p n="p142.151">
<s n="s1.4;p142.151">Her previous medical history included a stroke 10 years ago, which resulted in temporary right-sided paralysis and loss of the ability to swallow. </s>

<name type="other"/> had an uneventful post operative recovery and was released home after 5 days. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p148.151">The histology results reported a grade II (T2, N2/3, M1) invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 22mm in diameter. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p148.151">The closest resection margin was 28mm (Posterior). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p148.151">The tumour was moderately ER positive and negative for HER2 amplification. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p148.151">Her NPI score was 3.44 indicating a moderate chance of cure. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p148.151">There was no evidence of Paget's disease despite the close proximity to the nipple. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p148.151">There was no lymph node involvement. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p148.151">At the MDT meeting held following her surgery, it was decided that given her age she would be unsuitable for chemotherapy or radiotherapy. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p148.151">Instead it was agreed that tamoxifen prescribed over the next five years would be the most appropriate course of action. </s>
</p>
<p n="p149.151">
<s n="s1.3;p149.151">Following the surgery, <name type="other"/> was subsequently discharged back into the care of her GP and therefore follow-up was not possible. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p149.151">It may be necessary for the GP to arrange a review of her medication, as she would benefit from being transferred to an anti-arrhythmic which didn't cause photosensitivity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p149.151">Arrangements will also have to be made for the provision of her tamoxifen prescriptions, although the relative lack of side effects will be extremely valuable in her case. </s>
</p>
<p n="p150.151">
<s n="s1.5;p150.151">From a social perspective <name type="other"/> appeared to be happy with fact that she was still able to cope for herself at home albeit with occasional assistance from her children. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p150.151">She mentioned that she was still able to visit the local store and even caught the bus to the GP unattended when necessary. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p150.151">The only problem with day-to-day living that came to light was her limited ability to abduct the right arm, and fortunately no further disability arose as a result of the axillary surgery. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p150.151">With this in consideration there did not appear to be any further agency involvement which would have benefited Mrs <name type="other"/> at present. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p150.151">In addition the diagnosis itself did not appear to have a significant impact upon her, and she seemed to except the fact that the tamoxifen wouldn't necessarily cure her cancer, merely delay its progression. </s>
</p>
<p n="p151.151">
<s n="s1.2;p151.151">Although there are relatively few psychosocial issues which need to be addressed at present, it is important to consider that further problems may arise in future, particularly if her heart failure progresses or she develops breast metastases or another stroke. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p151.151">In that situation, her loss of mobility and increasing dependence upon others may have a substantial effect upon her especially given that she has been independent for such a long period, and clearly cherishes that freedom. </s>
