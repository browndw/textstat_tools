<head rend="bold">Explain how foods might acquire the following smells or flavours due to microbial action </head>
<p n="p17.27">
<s n="s1.2;p17.27">
<hi rend="bold">Rancid :</hi> This occurs when fat or fat in food goes bad . </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.27">This is due to bacterial action on fats which breaks down the fat into fatty acids and glycerol which give off the rancid smell. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.27">
<s n="s1.3;p18.27">
<hi rend="bold">Alcoholic :</hi> This is due to a fermentation process which normally occurs or is carried out by anaerobic bacteria . </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.27">The reaction is as follows the sugars in the fruit juice or food are broken down by yeast producing carbondioxide and water . </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.27">This process is essential in the brewing industry . </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.27">
<s n="s1.1;p19.27">
<hi rend="bold">Sour :</hi> This for example occurs in milk , occurs when carbohydrates in the food e.g. in milk lactose is broken down by lactic acid bacteria and this results in compounds which have a sour taste and foul smell . </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.27">
<s n="s1.1;p20.27">
<hi rend="bold">Putrid : This</hi> is a 'rotten or garbage like ' smell and results from the breakdown of proteins in foods by bacteria which produces compounds such as Hydrogen sulphide or ammonia compounds and one or a combination of this results in a putrid smell </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">List the pH values of the milk and yoghurt samples and explain why they are not identical </head>
<p n="p21.27">
<s n="s1.1;p21.27">Milk had a pH of 4.0 this is quite acidic as milk typically has a ph value of 6.4 -6.6<ref target="BAWE_6023d-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p22.27">Yoghurt in this experiment had a pH 6.0. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.27">This was somewhat higher (more basic ) than the typical value of yoghurt . (usually 3.8-4.2<ref target="BAWE_6023d-ftnote.002"/>) . </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p23.27">
<s n="s1.1;p23.27">The values for milk and yoghurt are not identical firstly because the two substances have different chemical properties to begin with, yoghurt is a product of the fermentation of milk . </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.27">
<s n="s1.1;p24.27">Secondly, they have undergone some spoilage as they're pH values are not in the typical range . </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Why , in Breeds smear method , are the microscopial and viable counts of a sample likely to be similar if each chain or clump of bacteria is counted as a single organism , whereas the counts may differ if every individual organism is counted in the Breed's smear. </head>
<p n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.4;p25.27">This is because of the assumption that upon successful dilution of a culture medium on a nutrient plate individual cells will be deposited and these when adequately incubated will go on to multiply . </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.27">Hence each colony or group of cells is a result of a single cell. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.27">However not all cells may multiply giving rise to colonies which may give the impression of fewer cells to start of with . </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.27">However, if each individual cell is counted , there would be no need to take that assumption . </s>

<head rend="bold">Discussion and Conclusion </head>
<p n="p26.27">
<s n="s1.4;p26.27">In the milk sample , despite the fact that the milk had an unusual smell and was overly acidic no bacteria were observed under the microscope. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.27">This demonstrates the importance of carrying out more than one test. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.27">The previous two tests definitely indicated spoilage but the extent or type of microorganism was not identified . </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.27">In an industry setting , a repeat of this stage would be necessary </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.27">
<s n="s1.2;p27.27">For the yoghurt and porridge oats the microorganisms present were clearly visible and identifiable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.27">This shows that simple rapid techniques are effective for identifying microorganisms in foods. </s>
