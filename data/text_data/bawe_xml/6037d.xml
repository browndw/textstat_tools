<s n="s3.4;p2.22">The temperature of the water was taken approximately every 10C. At each temperature reading the resistance was found by determining the value of the adjustable resistance that gave no deflection on the galvanometer when the key was depressed. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.22">From the results obtained an ordinary and log graph were drawn to shows trends in the data. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.22">The main trend was as the temperature increased the resistance of the semi-conductor decreased. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.22">This trend was expected because increasing the temperature meant that electrons were promoted to the conduction band. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.22">The graph of the logarithm of the resistance plotted against the temperature showed a linear relationship. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.22">There were no major anomalous results as the points plotted fitted the linear relationship. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.22">However one of the results showed a large decrease in resistance of the semi-conductor between 0C and 16.0C. This may have been due to the change in state of the water from a solid to a liquid. </s>

<p n="p5.22">
<s n="s1.8;p5.22">To conclude, as the temperature increased the resistance of a semi-conductor decreased. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.22">This was because resistivity is related to the behaviour of electrons in the material and the temperature of the semi-conductor. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.22">When the temperature was increased, it allowed electrons to be freed from their atomic orbits. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.22">This meant that more electrons were in the conduction band because they were promoted from the valence bad so the resistance was lowered. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.22">Small sources of error in the experiment were in the temperature readings and resistance measurements. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.22">It was very hard to know the exact temperature of the water when the resistance was being measured as it was constantly cooling down. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.22">When the resistance was being measured it was extremely difficult to prevent no current passing through the galvanometer but only a minimal amount was allowed through. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.22">An improvement to the experiment which would make it more accurate and confirm the trend would be to take more readings and repeat readings so the linear relationship could be confirmed. </s>

<p n="p7.22">
<s n="s1.5;p7.22">For a metal conductor, an increase in temperature causes an increase in resistance. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.22">The opposite is true for a semi -conductor because as temperature increases, resistance decreases. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.22">A metal conductor has a lattice structure and when the temperature increases, it increases the atom vibrations in the lattice structure. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.22">This causes the collision frequency between the charge carriers and the lattice structure to increase which in turn causes a reduction in speed of the charge carriers. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.22">Therefore the resistance is increased. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.22">
<s n="s1.2;p8.22">With a semi-conductor a temperature increase causes vibration of atoms that break some of the bonds between the valence electrons and the lattice atoms. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.22">This releases more charge carriers and therefore the resistance decreases. </s>
