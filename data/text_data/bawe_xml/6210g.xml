<s n="s1.7;p2.15">Electrochemical methods of analysis are based on the theory of galvanic cells. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.15">In a galvanic cell two electrode systems are interested into a medium of ions. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.15">The electrodes are then joined externally forming a circuit and the electron flow, which is established, causes a potential difference. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.15">This works on the theory of a spontaneous chemical reaction which sets up a potential difference, created by the 2 half reactions at each electrode. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.15">The electromotive force of the galvanic cell is dependant upon the difference between the potentials of the 2 electrodes. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.15">Cells are normally formed by combining a standard/reference electrode with an electrode whose potential or ionic behaviour is under study. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.15">Potential is dependant upon solution concentration therefore this technique can be used to determine concentrations via calibration plots of known concentrations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.2;p3.15">The most used reference electrode is the calomel electrode; this is composed of mercury and mercurous chloride (calomel) in contact with a solution containing chloride ions (potassium chloride). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.15">The concentration of the chloride determines the absolute potential; the electromotive forces however are also dependant upon temperature. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Experimental method:</head>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.8;p5.15">To begin a solution of NaF (0.1M) was taken and diluted to the following concentrations, 10mM, 1mM, 0.1mM, 0.01mM, and 0.001mM. This was achieved by using a pipette to transfer 10mL of the NaF solution into a 100mL volumetric flask, and diluted to volume. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.15">From this was then taken 10mL and further diluted to volume, and so on for the other concentrations (dilution by a factor of 10). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.15">Into separate beakers (Polythene, 100mL), labelled A-E was transferred 25mL of each of the standard solutions. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.15">Following this into polythene beakers labelled F-J was added 25mL of each metal fluoride solution (BaF <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, MgF <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, PbF <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, SrF <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, CaF <hi rend="sub">2</hi>), care was taken not to shake the saturated fluoride solution and the solution was pipette-ed from the top to avoid uptake of un-dissolved solid. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.15">To each of these polythene beakers was added 25.0mL of TISAB reagent, this was mixed well and subsequently placed in a thermostat-ed water bath, allowing the solution temperatures to equilibrate. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.15">Following this each solution was taken in turn and its potential difference measured. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.15">Electrodes were connected to the potentiometer, washed with distilled water and placed in the first standard solution (10mM), the potential was allowed to stabilised (around 1min) and the potential difference read. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.15">This was then repeated with the other standard solutions (B-E) and samples (F-J), washing the electrodes with distilled water between each measurement. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Describe the construction of the fluoride selective electrode. </head>
<p n="p7.15">
<s n="s1.5;p7.15">The Fluoride ion selective electrode is one of the most important and useful as the detection of the fluoride ion is rather difficult by most other methods. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.15">The ion selective electrode (solid state electrode) falls into the category of a membrane-separating electrode. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.15">This in the case of the fluoride selective electrode is comprised of a single crystal of lanthanum fluoride doped with some europium (II) to increase the conductivity of the crystal; this forms the membrane of the cell. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.15">The electrode contains an electrolyte solution that is typically composed of NaF and NaCl, the membrane of the cell separates different concentrations of this solution. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.15">The ion selective electrode is then used in conjunction with a standard Calomel electrode, both being dipped together into a solution containing Fluoride ions. </s>

<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.2;p12.15">The gradient of our plot is calculated to be, -0.0209, I would expect a value very close to zero due to the (Expected) linear nature of the calibration plot, linear increase of potential difference with fluoride ion concentration, this relationship is proportional. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.15">The R <hi rend="sup"> 2</hi> value is found to be 0.9806, standing as proof and as a measure of the linear relationship. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">Why is the TISAB reagent required? </head>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.4;p13.15">TISAB serves to minimise interferences with the fluoride electrode. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.15">Dilution with this buffer will provide a high ionic strength background, which will swap out any moderate variations in ionic strength between solutions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.15">This keeps the activity coefficient of the fluoride ion constant from solution to solution. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.15">The buffer contains CDTA, a chelating agent that prevents any complex formation with the F- ion, therefore also maintaining its activity from solution to solution. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Comment on the shape of the curve for [F-] vs. ionic radius. </head>

<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">Why has CaF2 the lowest solubility? </head>
<p n="p15.15">
<s n="s1.3;p15.15">Calcium Fluoride has the lowest solubility due to its high lattice enthalpy of 2602kJ mol <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.15">It occurs naturally as the mineral Fluorite, this adopts the calcium fluorite structure, the fluoride ions lie in a cubic arrangement with the fluoride and calcium ions being of comparable size, the insertion of the calcium ions into the structure causes an expansion of the cubic arrangement and the fluoride ions are no longer in contact with one another. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.15">Fluorite contains calcium ions in a cubic closest-packed arrangement with fluoride ions being in a tetrahedral environment, the unit cell consists of 4 atoms and 8 tetrahedral sites all of which are occupied by fluoride ions., Due to this close packed structure with all the tetrahedral holes being occupied this makes it difficult for any substance to penetrate and form a solution of calcium fluoride. </s>
