<s n="s2.6;p20.55">This is achieved in two stages. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p34.55">They are as follows: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p35.55">
<s n="s1.1;p35.55">A number of studies have shown it is more economical to build equipment made of simple components which are easy to modify, rather than strive to create a universal all-encompassing piece of equipment. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p36.55">
<s n="s1.2;p36.55">Flexure error causes variations in lever arm lengths and hence lever ratios. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p36.55">This factor is not helped by the large reduction ratio of 100:1 between the drum micrometer and the specimen. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p37.55">
<s n="s1.1;p37.55">There is no means to testing the sample in a controlled atmosphere as is required in many cases. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p38.55">
<s n="s1.1;p38.55">The entire method of measuring the cross sectional area of the specimen is rather crude and is bound to give errors. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p39.55">
<s n="s1.1;p39.55">The present machine is completely manual there are no means of automated strain recordings. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p40.55">
<s n="s1.2;p40.55">Since the specimen is held in position by glue there is always the danger of the specimen being bent due to uneven heating or melting of the glue. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p40.55">Hence more attention should have been paid to the design of specimen supports. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p41.55">
<s n="s1.2;p41.55">Given all due to credit for the design with technology available at that time there was no effort made to design a device to record the results. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p42.55">However in this device the combination of an atomic force microscope and an accurate mechanical testing machine provides unique yet efficient way to study the deformation mechanisms of a wide range of materials as they are incrementally strained. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p42.55">Making use of well controlled states of stress and strain to a material sample and observing the deformation of the sample with nanometer resolution, the nanomechanics of the material can be compared to the macroscopic stress strain behavior. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p43.55">A controlled deformation speed must be achieved in order to measure the deformation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p43.55">The other requirement being to measure the test sample from the cross head movement of the tensile testing machine and this measurement can also be made using three dimensional pictures using the improved technology available. </s>

<head rend="bold">Atomic force microscope:</head>
<p n="p44.55">
<s n="s1.3;p44.55">An atomic force microscope is chosen because it is commercially available and it makes design sense to design a system around a commercially available system. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p44.55">The use of an AFM makes sense because it gives the user the ability to visualize the surface of the specimen for close inspection a feature which was not available with Marsh's machine. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p44.55">Besides an AFM has several advantages listed below. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p45.55">
<s n="s1.1;p45.55">Compared with Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM), the AFM provides extraordinary topographic contrast, direct height measurements and unobscured views of surface features (no coating is necessary). </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p46.55">
<s n="s1.1;p46.55">Compared with Transmission Electron Microscopes, 3-dimensional AFM images are obtained without expensive sample preparation and yield far more complete information than the 2-dimensional profiles available from cross-sectioned samples. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p47.55">
<s n="s1.1;p47.55">Compared with Optical Interferometric Microscopes (Optical Profilers), the AFM provides unambiguous measurement of step heights, independent of reflectivity differences between materials. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p48.55">The deflection of the stylus is registered by the laser/photodiode sensor and the XYZ translator adjusts stylus or specimen (depending on microscope) up or down (Z) to restore the stylus to its original orientation. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p49.55">However the new improved version used a Load cell for load application. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p49.55">This is because load cells with their excellent stiffness minimises errors while measuring strain. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p49.55">The tensile testing machine makes use of three different piezoelectric load cells 25N, 250N and 4.4 KN. This results in a load range varying from 0-25N with a resolution of 125mN, a mid range of 0-250N with a resolution </s>

<s n="s1.4;p54.55">This is a great improvement over the earlier machine which lacked a control unit and was completely manual. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p54.55">This consists of two data acquisition cards that are connected to a computer. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p54.55">One card is used to create square wave signals to drive the stepper motor and to provide location and direction of motion for the slides. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p54.55">The other card is used to digitize the analog signals from the load cells as well as the digital signals from the end switches, which serve for setup of the machine as well as safety of the device. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p55.55">In the earlier machine there was no means of obtaining real time feed back or recording the results. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p55.55">The graphical user interface provides control over all aspects of the machine. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p55.55">The application software typically used for this purpose is LabVIEW. Once the setup is completed the user can conduct experiments and get real time feedback by operating the system in various modes. </s>
