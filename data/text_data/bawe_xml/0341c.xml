<s n="s1.3;p16.41">Fluid flow can be either laminar or turbulent. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.41">The factor that determines which type of flow is present is the ratio of inertia forces to viscous forces within the fluid, expressed by the non-dimensional Reynolds Number, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0341c-form.001"/>, where <hi rend="italic">V</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> are a fluid characteristic velocity and distance. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.41">For example, for fluid flowing in a pipe, <hi rend="italic">V</hi> could be the average fluid velocity, and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> would be the pipe diameter. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.41">
<s n="s1.1;p17.41">Typically, viscous stresses within a fluid tend to stabilize and organize the flow, whereas excessive fluid inertia tends to disrupt organized flow leading to chaotic turbulent behaviour. </s>

<p n="p18.41">
<s n="s1.3;p18.41">Fluid flows are laminar for Reynolds Numbers up to 2000. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p18.41">Between 2000 and 4000, the flow is in transition between laminar and turbulent, and it is possible to find sub-regions of both flow types within a given flow field. </s>

<head>Time</head>
<p n="p25.41">
<s n="s1.2;p25.41">This is linked to the volume, in that the clock is stopped when the volume reaches a predetermined level. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.41">Due to the rate at which the water rises, this is quite inaccurate, and more so the greater the velocity of the water. </s>

<head>Pressure</head>

<s n="s1.2;p26.41">There were large fluxuations in the digital reading for the pressure change. </s>

<head>17mm Smooth Pipe</head>
<p n="p28.41">
<s n="s1.6;p28.41">These results show a basic skin friction. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p28.41">From the results table it is clear that for this particular pipe all the Reynolds numbers fall between 10000 and 70000. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p28.41">Now this is clearly turbulent flow with little linearity. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p28.41">The Reynolds number drops throughout the sample due to the decreased flow rate and velocity of the sample, at higher velocities the water has a higher kinetic energy hence a higher turbulence and Reynolds number. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p28.41">There are a few anomalies in the friction factor; the value seems to increase significantly for the last few values. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p28.41">In these cases the volume collected was relatively small and so this rise is likely to be due to errors in the process. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.41">
<s n="s1.3;p29.41">From the graph in the appendix it can be seen that the pressure loss, or head loss, decreases as the velocity decreases. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p29.41">This is due to the fact that as the velocity increases the skin friction will have a greater effect on the liquid. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p29.41">From the table it can be seen that at velocities of 0.59 m/s the head loss is as low as 0.025 mH2O, in comparison to 0.819 mH2O at a velocity of 3.974 m/s. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>15mm Rough Pipe</head>
<p n="p30.41">
<s n="s1.4;p30.41">From the tables you can see that in this case the friction factor averages out at more than double that of the 17mm smooth pipe. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.41">The rough inner surface of this pipe gives it this large friction factor. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.41">The Reynolds number is slightly lower than that of the smooth pipe for similar velocities; compare 57535 at a velocity of 3.751 for the 15mm pipe to 64745 at a velocity of 3.725 for the smooth 17mm pipe. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.41">This shows that the flow is not quite as turbulent as in the smooth pipe due to the restrictive factor of the rough surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.41">
<s n="s1.2;p31.41">Again it can be seen, from the graph of head loss against velocity, that the head loss decreases as the velocity is decreased. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.41">This graph shows a linear fitting suggesting that the head loss is proportional to the velocity of the water. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head>4mm Smooth Pipe</head>
<p n="p32.41">
<s n="s1.8;p32.41">For this pipe the transition between turbulent and laminar flow is visible. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p32.41">The transitional period occurs with Reynolds numbers greater than 2000 and less than 4000. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p32.41">Anything below 2000 is theoretically laminar flow. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p32.41">On page 2 of the 4mm table Reynolds numbers ranging from around 12000 to 1873 are shown. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p32.41">The final recording shows laminar flow, and recordings 8 and 9 show the transition. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p32.41">These three are at very low velocities. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p32.41">For the final recording, when the flow is laminar, the table shows a very low head loss of 0.076 mH2O. When the flow is laminar the energy of the water is conserved to a higher degree. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p32.41">Turbulence causes inefficiencies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.41">
<s n="s1.1;p33.41">Again the graph of head loss against velocity shows a relatively linear relationship, further reinforcing the assumed relationship between the two. </s>

<p n="p34.41">
<s n="s1.5;p34.41">The results collected were limited by many factors. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p34.41">Further work is needed to study the turbulent-laminar transition. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p34.41">Pipes with diameters of less than 4mm should be studied to get a detailed view of this transition. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p34.41">Another limitation was the velocity at which the water entered the system; the valve gave a limit on the maximum speed. </s>
