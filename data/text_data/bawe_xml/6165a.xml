<s n="s1.4;p61.70">RME has greater air cooling losses than diesel. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p61.70">The air volume flow rate is also, in general, higher for RME, and so more heat can be transported away faster than for diesel. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p61.70">The majority of total heat lost is through air cooling of the engine, and this amount increases as load increases. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p61.70">At higher loads, the engine is producing more heat, and air heat capacity increases with temperature, so increasing amounts of energy are lost at higher temperatures. </s>

<p n="p62.70">
<s n="s1.5;p62.70">Figures 10 and 11 show the energy balances in the engine. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p62.70">Total heat losses are exhaust losses plus air cooling losses, and the figures show how most of the energy available from burning the fuel is converted into waste energy. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p62.70">Only a small amount of the total energy in is converted into useful power. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p62.70">At low loads, almost all of the energy available in the fuel is lost as waste heat. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p62.70">The energy used in overcoming engine friction is dissipated as heat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p63.70">
<s n="s1.3;p63.70">It may be that more accurate estimation of exhaust and air cooling losses can be made using the inlet air temperature instead of ambient air temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p63.70">However, since the inlet temperature is only a few degrees higher than the ambient, this only makes a slight difference to the exhaust and air cooling losses. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p63.70">In general, the exhaust losses decrease by about 50 Watts, and the air cooling losses increase equivalently by 50 Watts. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p64.70">Each measurement was performed at one engine speed only (2800 rpm). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p64.70">A full investigation would require measurements to be made at different engine speeds in order to fully compare engine performance with diesel and RME. </s>
</p>
<p n="p65.70">
<s n="s1.1;p65.70">One thing to note is that the window of the lab was opened during the experiment, for the duration of the engine run using RME. This reduced ambient air temperatures and inlet temperatures, which may have had some effect on the results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p66.70">
<s n="s1.6;p66.70">RME has a lower Lower Heat Value than diesel (see appendix 1), meaning that there is less energy per unit mass of fuel. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p66.70">This means that the engine has a higher fuel consumption of RME to achieve same power produced by diesel. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p66.70">However, RME has lower engine friction, since RME is a better lubricant than diesel, meaning that less power converted in the engine is needed to counteract friction. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p66.70">This may be shown in figure 1, where RME has lower brake specific fuel consumption at low loads. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p66.70">RME loses more heat in exhaust losses and air cooling losses than diesel at higher brake mean effective pressures. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p66.70">It is likely that the 'extra' energy from lower friction in the engine with RME is lost at higher loads as heat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p67.70">
<s n="s1.4;p67.70">RME burns faster to provide same power output as diesel (since it has a lower fuel energy capacity), so fuel flow rates are faster for the engine running on RME, and this means faster air flow rates. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p67.70">However, the air/fuel ratio of RME is lower than diesel for a given load - this may be due to the chemical composition of RME in comparison to diesel. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p67.70">RME is an ester, which contains some oxygen. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p67.70">It could be that the oxygen content already in the fuel means that less air is required for RME to burn. </s>
</p>
<p n="p68.70">
<s n="s1.3;p68.70">RME has higher exhaust and air cooling losses. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p68.70">It could be that RME burns at a higher temperature than diesel, and so more energy is lost as waste heat. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p68.70">The higher heat losses could be due to the higher fuel consumption rates: more heat energy is being produced per second for RME. Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11 must be viewed as only qualitative representations, since heat capacity of air was only roughly estimated from a table of figures. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p69.70">Figure 7 shows the indicated efficiency of the engine on RME and diesel. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p69.70">There appears to be a peak in efficiency at medium loads, indicating that the diesel engine is best run at medium loads. </s>
</p>
<p n="p70.70">
<s n="s1.2;p70.70">In conclusion, diesel engine run on the biofuel RME will have a higher fuel consumption rate and a lower efficiency than the same engine run on mineral oil diesel. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p70.70">However, fuels must also be considered in light of their larger environmental impacts, and it is in this area that RME has advantages over diesel. </s>
