Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
