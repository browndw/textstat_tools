</p>
<p n="p8.47">
<s n="s1.1;p8.47">In fact in Italy, not only are translated titles quite numerous, compared to other countries: on average they also have higher print-runs, possibly because rights are bought only for those titles for which sales are expected to cover costs, including the translator's fee. </s>

<p n="p9.47">

<s n="s1.1;p17.47">At a lower level than that of a European beacon, according to Paola Seghi of the Italian Publishers' Association (AIE) International Department for the Promotion of Italian Publishing Abroad, there actually is a new trend favouring Italian culture in the world, particularly strong in the USA. American college students, apparently, pick up Italian after having studied Spanish as a first foreign language, attracted by the language of fashion, food, Firenze, and sometimes of their forefathers<ref target="BAWE_3045d-endnote.006"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p20.47">Hopefully , that foreign language is not English: in Britain, translations account for a mere 3-5% of books. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.47">According to translator Susan Pickford, of the Université Paris X - Nanterre, this is partly due to the lack of habit of reading a book to get to know a different culture, with translations being systematically downplayed by marketing. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p29.47">According to the AIE, to confront export difficulties and low growth rates in the study of Italian literature and language abroad, "the key point, perhaps more critical than finding necessary resources, is to coordinate initiatives the effectiveness of which is directly proportional to the capacity of building critical mass and therefore involving more subjects, public (Government and Regions) and private." <ref target="BAWE_3045d-endnote.010"/> </s>

<quote lang="English">"Being a translator - in an agency, freelancing, technical or general, Pashto or Basque - is being part of a community of creative minds, who share an amazing ability to transcend borders and make the implicit understood, everywhere." (professional translator Edurne Alvarez, <hi rend="italic">So You Want to be a Translator</hi>, from Translatorscafe.com, December 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> 2005)</quote>
<quote lang="English">"Translators are ghastly: poor devils who get nothing for a translation, only the lowliest fee - shamefully low, as they are wont to say - and they accomplish a ghastly job. In other words: the balance is restored. If a person does something that is worth nothing, then they should get nothing for it. Why does anyone translate? Why don't they write their own stuff instead?" (writer Thomas Bernhard, quoted in Why does anyone translate? by Tim Wilkinson, on <seg type="URL" n="www.eurozine.com"/>)</quote>
