<p n="p1.9">
<s n="s1.2;p1.9">By ancient decree, commercially grown grape vines and wine production are not allowed in Brittany. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.9">The nearest wine comes from the Loire valley, particularly Muscadet from the Nantes region (Purefrance.com, 2005). </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6012d-fig.001"/>
<p n="p2.9">
<s n="s1.3;p2.9">With Carnac's proximity to the region, Muscadet would be the ideal choice of grape, having thick skin and being hardy and an early ripener. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.9">In this region, soils vary from Clayey-limestone, limestone, siliceous and chalky soils, but are Muscadet is usually grown in regions of granite. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.9">The weather is influenced by the Atlantic, with warm ocean currents resulting in mild winters and warm summers and also a damp climate. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Vineyard Establishment</head>
<p n="p3.9">
<s n="s1.13;p3.9">Establishment and operating costs can vary significantly. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p3.9">Major establishment costs include land, land preparation, labour, grapevines, trellis materials and pest management materials. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p3.9">The site should be prepared by weeding and fertilisation to increase the organic matter content of the soil. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p3.9">Ripping the soil to a depth of 5 feet, and establishing a ridge of soil about 10 inches high and 2 feet wide, on which vines are to be planted may be advantageous. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p3.9">This will provide an improved surface and internal drainage, and allow for deeper rooting, also preventing ponding of water around the base of vines, which can lead to disease. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p3.9">Soil may be tested for fertility and pH, and if necessary nutrients, such as potassium, and limestone, to achieve pH 5.5-5.6, may be added. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p3.9">Planting would typically be in straight rows running in a north-south direct, to allow for maximum sunlight interception. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p3.9">If the vines were to be planted on a slope, it may be necessary to plant across the slope. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p3.9">If pest control is to be an issue, it may be advantageous to plant the rows parallel to prevailing costal winds. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p3.9">Rows should be spaced, with a distance of 8-10 feet, or wider if larger harvesting equipment must be accommodated. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p3.9">Planting should take place in early spring, when the risk of frost has passed. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p3.9">Roots should be soaked and pruned as necessary, and the planting hole large enough to accommodate the root system. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p3.9">For grafted vines, the graft union should be at least 2-3 inches above the soil level to prevent scion rooting (Vine <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1997). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.9">
<s n="s1.8;p4.9">It is important to properly train vines during the first few years of growth. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.9">Trellising can vary extensively, but all function to support the weight of heavy ripening fruit and to establish a vine form, which is easy to manage. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.9">It is especially important to provide good weed control during the first several years of vineyard establishment. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.9">Young vines do not compete well with grasses and weeds for soil nutrients, moisture and sunlight. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.9">Weed control may be achieved either mechanically or through use of herbicides for larger plantings. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.9">After a vineyard is established, management practises take over. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.9">Grape vines require annual pruning to remain productive and manageable. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.9">Control of diseases and pests is necessary to maintain healthy leaves and protect the fruit from various types of deterioration (Vine <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1997). </s>

<head rend="bold italic">White wine production</head>
<p n="p5.9">
<s n="s1.2;p5.9">White wines are exclusively produced by the fermentation of grape juice. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.9">The flow diagram below illustrates the basic outline of the procedure: </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6012d-fig.002"/>
<p n="p6.9">
<s n="s1.3;p6.9">Picking may be by hand for minimal damage and maximum selection, but this is expensive, therefore machine picking is common, with greater damage to the fruit as a consequence. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.9">Juice extraction and varying degrees of clarification precede alcoholic fermentation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.9">The sensory characteristics of a dry white wine are particularly dependant on the conditions of the pre-fermentation operations of picking, crushing, pressing and clarification. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.9">
<s n="s1.1;p7.9">The schematic below (DSM-Oenology.com, 2005) illustrates some of the equipment that would be used in the commercial production of white wine: </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6012d-fig.003"/>
<p n="p8.9">
<s n="s1.12;p8.9">Stems are removed by a de-stemmer, to avoid excess tannin extraction and transfer of vegetal characteristics. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p8.9">Grapes are crushed to allow juice extraction, but pressing should be gentle enough that juice extraction from grape pulp only, and not stems, seeds or skins. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p8.9">Grape must may be treated using SO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and possibly ascorbic acid, to improve colour and fruit flavour. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p8.9">In the New World, particularly, grape juice is then clarified in order to remove solid particles: wild yeast and oxidases from the must before fermentation. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p8.9">This prevents the formation of off-flavours and vegetal characteristics and reduces SO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> combinations. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p8.9">Clarification processes used include centrifugation, filtration or flotation. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p8.9">During alcoholic fermentation, natural sugars present in the must are converted into CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and ethanol. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p8.9">This process is a complex series of conversions carried out by enzymes within a yeast cell. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p8.9">The sugars provide yeast with energy to continue fermentation until alcohol reaches a level where it becomes toxic and actually inhibits their growth. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p8.9">Fermentations vessels for most commercial wines are stainless steel, however oak may be used for premium wines. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p8.9">Fermentation temperatures of 15-20 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C are regard as normal for obtaining good fruity flavour. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p8.9">Malolactic fermentation is less practised in white wine production, but may be used to deacidfy the wine by the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid by bacteria (Ribéreau-Gayon, 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.9">
<s n="s1.4;p9.9">In Nantes, Muscadet winemaking is according to the Sur Lie method. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.9">The wines are left over winter in either the barrel or vinification vat. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.9">During this time, the wines feed off the fine lees in the vats or barrels. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.9">The surplus of carbon dioxide, this produces gives a very slight carbonated nature, which increases the wines freshness (Azureva.com, 2005). </s>
