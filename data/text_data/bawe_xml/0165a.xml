<s n="s4.11;p4.16">Generally the courts take a broad definition of this and individuals who have been affected by the action or decision usually have enough to constitute sufficient interest. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.16">The courts also have the power to use their own discretion, for example in <hi rend="italic">R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex p Rees-Mogg</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.006"/> where as the matter was of public interest, the right for judicial review was granted. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p4.16">Therefore they each have standing. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.16">The exclusivity principle has been slightly relaxed since Lord Woolf's comments in <hi rend="italic">Trustees of the Dennis Rye Pension Fund v Sheffield City Council</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.007"/>, therefore all three pupils would satisfy the procedural constraints. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p8.16">Pupil X has two bases for his argument. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p8.16">First is that the medical report that details the possibility that the second drug test was inaccurate. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.16">This may well be seen as not taking relevant considerations into account. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.16">The concept of 'relevant consideration<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.010"/>' is subjective and can be variable but the fact that the medical report if included may have had a definitive effect on the hearing outcome, suggests that it would be sufficient grounds to dismiss the decision. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.16">The law in this area though is still developing and it may be wise for pupil X to claim through the concept of 'natural justice.' </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.16">In the landmark case of <hi rend="italic">Ridge v Baldwin</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.012"/>, it was held that the obligation to observe natural justice extends to administrative decision-making even to that of schoolteachers<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.16">X's claim would rest upon the fact that the refusal to consider the medical report was a breach of the duty to act fairly, and the right to a fair hearing, <hi rend="italic">audi alteram partem</hi>. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.16">There exists 'the right to make representations, or to submit reasoned arguments rebutting any allegations'<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.014"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p9.16">The other grounds that pupil X might be granted a quashing order is that the whole policy of automatic expulsion is irrational and/ or disproportionate. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p9.16">This case is regarding a policy of the school, and it has been held that policy decisions of public bodies can be judicially reviewed, especially where an individual's fundamental rights are affected,<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.016"/> which is clearly the case here as expulsion affects the student's right to an education. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p9.16">In order to succeed with a claim that this policy is irrational, it would have to fulfil the <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> criteria of being 'so unreasonable that no rational decision maker could have reached it." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s4.10;p9.16">There are several reasons why this claim would surely not succeed - the policy is clearly in place to protect students, drugs are illegal and many schools indeed have stricter policies than this. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p9.16">Therefore, the policy is not unreasonable, and so not open to judicial review through this means. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p9.16">Proportionality is not currently a separate ground for review in English law, although it has been suggested. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s7.10;p9.16">It is a principle of European Community Law, however. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.16">To succeed, it would have to be shown that the action if restricting a fundamental right was not disproportionate to the public purpose sought to be achieved. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p9.16">Here, the public purpose of disallowing drugs into a school is clear, and the intensity of the review for proportionality may be even greater than using the <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> Test, so it is unlikely to succeed on either ground. </s>

<s n="s5.12;p13.16">In this hearing the issue was about drug taking and not his grades. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p13.16">It, again, is a subjective decision though and would be very difficult to prove that the panel had taken his grades into account unless they admit as such. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p13.16">Therefore pupil Z will have to rely on the other issue, that they exercised their discretionary power for a purpose other than the one they were granted<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.024"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p13.16">The idea of improper purpose is linked to failing to disregard irrelevant facts and has the same connotations. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p13.16">However, following the cases of <hi rend="italic">Westminster Corp ex p Soblen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ex p Kahn</hi>, if it is held that the true or dominant purpose was justified, then the secondary objective that is attained is deemed not to be relevant. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p13.16">Due to the confusion of case law in this area, it is very difficult to assess whether this would be a reasonable ground for review and also difficult to prove. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p13.16">The argument that the panel was bias is also a possible avenue for pupil Z has the teachers have a monetary interest for him to be expelled. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p13.16">Due to the difficulty in proving either factor pupil Z does not have an exceptionally strong case. </s>

<s n="s2.12;p14.16">If these parties appealed to the local authority board about the decisions instead of applying for judicial review, the outcomes could be different. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p14.16">This is because in appeals, the board will be able to look at the merits of the cases and decide whether the decision was right or wrong. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p14.16">The board could even decide to substitute the decision for its own decision<ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.025"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p14.16">This is obviously different to judicial review, which merely refers the decision back to the original decision-maker if there has been a successful review. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p14.16">The appeal board would have much more discretion to look at whether the decisions were fair, and could quash the expulsions or suspensions if the board saw fit, whereby a successful application for judicial review could not change the decision of the board directly. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p14.16">The board will not be bound to follow the procedure of a trial, and would give the parties a fair opportunity to correct any relevant statement that was prejudicial to their view. <ref target="BAWE_0165a-ftnote.026"/>Appeals can be on a question of fact or solely on the merits of the decision. </s>
