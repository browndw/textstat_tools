<p rend="bulleted" n="p1.32">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p1.32">The equation of the line of best fit is approximately y = -0.23x + 97.5, where x = mortality rate and y = literacy rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.32">
<s n="s1.5;p2.32">The line fits the data reasonably well, and there is evidence of negative correlation as most of the data points are close to the line of best fit. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.32">This suggests a possible link between mortality rates and literacy rates, possibly that a lower literacy rate among adult women results in higher mortality rates of the under 5's. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.32">If this is the case, then a low literacy rate seems to have a dramatic effect of the mortality rate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.32">The distribution of the points shows that most of the countries have a high literacy rate of over 80% and a low mortality rate of fewer than 90. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.32">The graph also shows the existence of an outlier, labelled <hi rend="italic">G</hi>, referring to data collected from Guatemala. </s>

<head rend="italic">Part b)</head>
<p n="p3.32">
<s n="s1.2;p3.32">According to the data, Nicaragua had a mortality rate of 78. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.32">Judging by the line of best fit, and using its equation, the corresponding literacy rate can be estimated to about 80. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.32">
<s n="s1.3;p4.32">The data refers to 1990, and at this time approximately 85% of the population of the UAE were foreign workers and their dependants, many of them oil and construction workers from Pakistan, India and other parts of '3 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> World' Asia. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.32">It is likely that there was a low literacy over this part of the population, including the women, which has therefore produced a low average literacy rate across the whole population of women (a rate of only 38). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.32">However, the majority of births will have take place into wealthier, literate, families who are resident to the UAE. These families will benefit from good medical care and education, and thus the mortality rate for these babies will be low, (a rate of only 30) </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.32">
<s n="s1.6;p5.32">It has been suggested that considering a mortality rate of 78, Nicaragua probably had a literacy rate of about 80. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.32">However, when the history of Nicaragua is considered, this result seems unlikely. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.32">In 1990, Nicaragua was in a similar situation to Honduras and El Salvador, and particularly Guatemala. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.32">Some of these countries were recovering from civil war, and governmental corruption. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.32">As a result of these exceptional circumstances, much less money was spent on education, which accounts for lower literacy rates, despite a mid-range mortality rate. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.32">So it is more likely that the literacy rate was lower, possibly somewhere in between 47 (Guatemala) and 71 (Honduras). </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.32">
<s n="s1.2;p6.32">There is no indication as to how the data was collected, particularly how large the sample size was. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.32">The reliability of the data as a representative of the population is therefore unclear, so it is difficult to draw any general inferences. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.32">
<s n="s1.1;p7.32">It may have been more likely for data to be collected from groups with high literacy and low mortality rates, as these people were probably more accessible to the data collector. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.32">
<s n="s1.3;p8.32">There is at least one extreme outlier, and there is a large range of data. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.32">This supports the idea that there may be many more factors involved in the supposed relationship. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.32">Ignoring these other factors simplifies the situation to such a degree that the accuracy of any conclusions could be questionable. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.32">
<s n="s1.2;p9.32">It is possible that each piece of data is not independent from the others. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.32">A factor may be the geographical location of countries with respect to one another, as events taking place in one area made then have a complicated effect on any neighbouring countries. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.32">
<s n="s1.2;p10.32">It is likely that the data was collected over a long period of time, and rates of literacy and mortality may not have remained constant over the period. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.32">This would create more complexity when comparing data. </s>
