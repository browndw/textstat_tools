<head rend="bold">Part A: The Bracketing Method</head>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.67">
<s n="s1.13;p1.67">For the first part of this project the bracketing method was used to solve the solution to x=exp(-x) iteratively. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p1.67">Before commencing the writing of the program itself, it may be useful to explain how the bracketing method works. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p1.67">The bracketing method is very simple and will always iterate toward a true solution unlike some other iterative methods (such as Newton-Raphson). </s>
<s n="s4.13;p1.67">If you imagine some arbitrary values of a function f(x) such that f(x <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)&lt;0 and f(x <hi rend="sub">2</hi>)>0 we know that the true solution (or root) of the function lies in the range x <hi rend="sub">1</hi>&lt;x&lt;x <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p1.67">If you take a further point, exactly halfway between x <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and x <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, say x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi> then if f(x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi>)>0, you know immediately the solution lies somewhere between x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi> and x <hi rend="sub">1</hi> else the solution must lie between x <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p1.67">At this point, it may be worth mentioning x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi> can be calculated by (x <hi rend="sub">1</hi>-x <hi rend="sub">2</hi>)/2. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p1.67">In doing this, we have halved the size of the original range where the root must lie. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p1.67">If the root lay in the region x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi> and x <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, then you would simply call x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi>=x <hi rend="sub">2</hi> now and repeat the process, and likewise if it lay in the region between x <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi> then call x <hi rend="sub">mid</hi>=x <hi rend="sub">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p1.67">Continuing this process of reducing the size of the region where the true solution can lie is called iteration and continuing to half the region where the solution lies will eventually narrow the root down to some value which is accurate enough for use. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p1.67">The bracketing method is unconditionally convergent; the root always lies in the new region after each step of iteration. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p1.67">The convergence rate is clearly defined. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p1.67">This will be discussed in detail later along with the accuracy and uncertainty of the bracketing method. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p1.67">The convergence rate produced by the program will also be analysed. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">The Program</head>
<p n="p2.67">
<s n="s1.3;p2.67">A equation was given such that x=exp(-x) and the task in hand was to solve this iteratively. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.67">To do this f(x) needed to be equal to 0 (f(x)=0) and hence x=e <hi rend="sup">-x</hi> had to be rearranged from the initial equation that was given to 0=exp(-x)-x. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.67">A function was then defined as f(x)=exp(-x)-x and at this point a MATLAB function was also defined, fun.m (<hi rend="italic">see appendix</hi>) that would be used to solve the problem iteratively. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.67">
<s n="s1.3;p3.67">After defining the function, a program exp.m (<hi rend="italic">see appendix</hi>) was written to solve the problem iteratively using the bracketing method described previously. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.67">Three arrays were defined to store the values of xlow, xhigh and xmid and then used a loop to find the iterative solution to the function fun.m. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.67">The program was written to plot a graph of the xlow and xhigh arrays so that graphically I could see them converging on the correct result. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.67">
<s n="s1.5;p4.67">The way the bracketing method works requires one value of x to be positive and the other to be negative in comparison to the true solution for it to iterate correctly, with that being the case some values had to be chose such that the xlow value and the xhigh value that gave solutions with different signs (that is f(x)&lt;0 and f(x)>0). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.67">Having defined the function fun.m, at the MATLAB prompt one can select some values of x by simply entering fun(z), where z is any real number in order to get the solution at that value of z. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.67">The values of fun(0) and fun(5) (Figure 1) were tried and had solutions values of 1 and -4.99326205300091 respectively. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.67">These values were therefore suitable for xlow and xhigh because the solutions had different signs. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.67">In the program therefore xlow and xhigh were defined xlow=0.0 and xhigh=5.0. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p5.67">With these initial conditions and the number of iterations n set to n=10 the program was ran. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.67">The x low value was 0.56640625000000 and the xhigh value 0.57128906250000 and so it was fairly clear at this point that the program was working and converging on a solution somewhere between 0.56 and 0.57. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.67">The graph shown in Figure 2 shows very clearly the way the program is beginning to converge to a single solution. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.67">You can see the solution starting from the xhigh value of 5 and converging down to the true solution. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.67">You may notice the xlow value appears to start at 4 instead of 0, this is because of the way the bracketing method works. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.67">When the iteration started, for the first four iterations xlow stays as 0. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.67">This is because xlow was closer to the true solution that xhigh. </s>
