<hi rend="italic">You cannot be born in a land and live there for thirty or a hundred years without it becoming a part of you and you a part of it. The language, the geography, the customs, the rituals, the tastes and the styles all become integral to who you are, even if they are not discernable by others. They cannot but help define you. Identify you. Home is the kiln of identity; the place where all aspects of life and society converge to create that indisputable sense of being and belonging.</hi> <ref target="BAWE_0417b-ftnote.001"/>

<s n="s3.4;pn1.1">The English-speaking population of Quebec is termed Quebec Anglophones. </s>
<s n="s4.4;pn1.1">The main reason that the term Québécois is not being used in this paper is that there is continuing controversy over whether Quebec Anglophones are considered to be Québécois. </s>

<s n="s1.16;p3.20">The arrival of the French colonists in 1535 began Canada's European history. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p3.20">From 1535 to 1763, the colony of La Nouvelle France was established in what is currently Quebec, and was comprised of approximately 65 000 francophones. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p3.20">In 1763, however, La Nouvelle France fell from French control into the hands of the British. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p3.20">"The first policy act, the Royal Proclamation of 1763, was quite definitely assimilationist in intent. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0417b-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s6.16;p3.20">However, in order to secure the loyalties of the francophone population, the British passed the Quebec Act, which guaranteed the francophone majority the right to practice their faith (Catholicism), omitted religious references from the oath required for their public office and, arguably most importantly, allowed for French civil law to be used in all local matters. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p3.20">The Quebec Act was truly the first effort at recognizing the QF as a minority, despite the fact that at this point in history they were still a majority in numbers. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p3.20">In 1791, the Constitutional Act established two colonies: Lower Canada (predominantly French) and Upper Canada (predominantly English). </s>
<s n="s9.16;p3.20">However, segregating the colonies did not bring peace to the linguistic divisions. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p3.20">Following increasingly hostile demands for responsible government, 1840 saw the establishment of the Union Act, which created the single "province" of Canada, a legislative council and an elected assembly for the combined Upper and Lower Canada. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p3.20">English was the only official language of government, and for the first two years of its existence, Francophones were excluded from participation. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p3.20">Eventually, "the use of French language returned to the assembly, though English remained the official language." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0417b-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s13.16;p3.20">In 1867, the British North America Act created the federal union of Canada. </s>

<s n="s15.16;p3.20">"The Province of Quebec, not the French-Canadian nation was technically the unit entering Confederation. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p4.20">Trudeau established the Official Languages Act, which declared both French and English to be the official languages of Canada, requiring that all positions and services in the public service and all governmental proceedings and documents be available in French, as well as English. </s>

<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.4;p5.20">The Parti Québécois came roaring to power in 1976 and the exodus of the QA community began, as the QA feared that they would be trapped in a sovereign Quebec with no rights. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.20">The housing market crashed and one of the few English newspapers in Montreal, the Montreal Star, shut down its presses. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.20">As individual Anglophones left Quebec, more were forced to leave as large corporations relocated their headquarters out of the unstable world Quebec had become. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.20">To this day the numbers of how many QA fled is unclear, however, "according to a study released in November 1978 ... at least forty-two major companies moved all or a major part of their head office operations out of Quebec in the two years after the election of the Parti Quebecois." <ref target="BAWE_0417b-ftnote.006"/> </s>
