<p n="p22.24">
<s n="s1.6;p22.24">When we look at Dworkin's theory and the view of the CLS writers we see that though their aim is the same, i.e., to bring about consistency in the legal system the routes they take is different. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p22.24">Dworkin believes that by keeping the judges' discretionary power to the minimum and using well-established rules and principles in deciding cases by interpreting them, there would be coherence. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.24">Whereas the CLS writers believe that any at interpretation either by using rules or principles would not fetch any result. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.24">A complete change has to be brought about. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.24">The law is so flawed and has so many contradictions; if the judges were given discretion it would only aggravate the problem. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.24">The process of 'trashing' whereby all the inconsistencies are highlighted and 'deconstruction' where all the legal material are re - analysed would help in the endeavour to make law more consistent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.24">
<s n="s1.4;p23.24">The 'one right answer' of Dworkin is not an acceptable one, because every question has more than one answer, we can just think of this as a better alternative but not the right answer. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.24">As for CLS, speaking in a realistic way whatever is done the legal system will still have its own contradictions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.24">The Utopian legal system is impossible to achieve. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.24">Why do we have to regard an incoherent and inconsistent legal doctrine as a flaw in the system, especially if we are arguing that law is necessarily inconsistent and contradictory?<ref target="BAWE_0086d-ftnote.039"/> </s>

<s n="s1.6;p24.24">To sum up the use of principles is very important in deciding cases but wherever possible well-established rules may be used<ref target="BAWE_0086d-ftnote.040"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.24">Otherwise there will be inconsistency in the law because the judge will use principles and may be give an altogether different decision not consistent with the rules. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.24">So their power must be curtailed according to Dworkin. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.24">But for the CLS scholars whether a case is decided by rules or principles there will be inconsistency in the law; so the legal system has to undergo a change. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.24">But it better to use rules and maintain some coherence than try attempt a complete change with the result that the position will still remain the same. </s>
