<s n="s1.4;p1.48">On 14 December 1994 The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam called on African-American men of all classes to join a 'Million Man March' in Washington D.C. through the organisation's newspaper <hi rend="italic">The Final Call</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0318b-ftnote.001"/> The civil rights movement from the 1970s was characterised by court cases, the production of films and documentaries related to earlier moments in the struggle, occasional Civil Rights Acts, and riots. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.48">The Million Man March, therefore, stands out as a renewed attempt at mass action. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.48">Convened by a black nationalist, Muslim organisation, this would be an event of major significance and far more complex and controversial than conventional civil rights protests. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.48">Situating the proposed march, which occurred on 16 October 1995, in its historical context is crucially important. </s>

<p n="p2.48">
<s n="s1.8;p2.48">Reading the Million Man March as being fundamentally based on gender is but one possible interpretation. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.48">The March could be read in terms of race - situated in the rich historical tradition of the African-American struggle for civil rights, or held as another example of angry black separatism if one subscribes to the popular image of the Nation of Islam. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.48">The March could be analysed as a political protest, prompted by African-Americans feeling under-represented and ignored by those in political power, for example. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.48">The march could be a protest about the economic situation for African-Americans. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.48">Declining industry, poor educational standards, and racial discrimination in the workplace were together creating an escalating crisis of unemployment and underemployment, particularly for men. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.48">Alternatively, the March could be read as a religious event, initiated by the Nation of Islam and supported by many other black Christian churches to re-introduce black men to spirituality in order to 'save' the race. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.48">Of course, in reality the March was convened for a complexity of reasons, and it was aimed at African-Americans of a vast array of political, occupational and religious persuasions. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.48">Race and gender are the two categories that permeate and complicate every potential angle of analysis, so they will be used to analyse the Million Man March here. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.48">
<s n="s1.6;p3.48">Debates over contemporary interpretations of the so-called "Negro problem" - arguments as old as slavery itself - had once again become more urgent as the African-American condition was perceived to have reached a crisis point, particularly for men. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.48">Events such as the beating of Rodney King in March 1991 and consequent Los Angeles Riots in April 1992 after the acquittal of his police officer assailants, and the O. J. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.48">Simpson trial intensified strength of feeling among both blacks and whites, and the situation became increasingly politicised. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.48">Meanwhile, the intellectual climate in the United States was particularly characterised by a crescendo of debate over constructions of gender. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.48">Although there was a first wave of black women's movements in the US at the turn of the nineteenth century, the second wave that began in the 1970s was a far more significant movement, which changed paradigm of what became gender history because it prompted the emergence on men's studies in response from the 1980s. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.48">Intellectuals such as Orlando Patterson began arguing that African-American men were <hi rend="italic">the</hi> most isolated group in American society.<ref target="BAWE_0318b-ftnote.002"/> The <hi rend="italic">Transition</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0318b-ftnote.003"/> Symposium on 'The Crisis of African American Gender Relations' and Farrakhan's Million Man March are two manifestations of a critical moment, when race relations, gender relations, and discourses on the racial uplift of African-Americans, intersected. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p4.48">The Million Man March captured America's attention for a number of weeks. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.48">One of the main aims of the March, according to Farrakhan along with the great majority of participants, was to force the media to reassess their generally negative portrayal of African-American men. </s>
