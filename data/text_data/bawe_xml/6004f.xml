<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p42.59">
<s n="s1.6;p42.59">For the pour plate using melted PCA, the only countable plates were the 10 <hi rend="sup">-6</hi> dilution samples. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p42.59">This shows that there were more bacteria present than anticipated and more diluted samples would have given a lower count and may have been more accurate. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p42.59">The colony count for this part of the experiment gave a mean of 277. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p42.59">When comparing this with the class mean of 378, there is a clear difference. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p42.59">The class results are likely to be more accurate as a whole because there were more samples which can even out error. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p42.59">The class results give a much smaller 95% confidence limit as a percent value due to the larger amount of duplications and the effects this has in finding a more accurate result. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.59">
<s n="s1.4;p43.59">The spread plate also used PCA agar but gave a higher colony count. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p43.59">This is possibly due to the method used, as the same dilutions were spread on the plates. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p43.59">Pour plates may cause less growth to occur as organisms under the agar may not have sufficient oxygen. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.59">It is also possible that there were small colonies under the agar that were not counted, as it is more difficult to clearly identify them when they are suspended. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.59">
<s n="s1.9;p44.59">The VRBGA pour plate used was selective for Enterobacteriaceae and inhibits growth of certain other bacteria. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p44.59">The colonies were purple/pink in colour and some had halo's around the colony. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p44.59">This is caused by the glucose present in the medium being converted to acid, and the bile salts in the medium precipitate away from this. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p44.59">The colonies of 0.5mm or more were counted. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p44.59">Due to poor mixing the 10 <hi rend="sup">-4</hi> dilution could not be counted as the colonies were all grouped together but the 10 <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> plate gave a sufficient count. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p44.59">Comparing the individual results for this against the class results, it can be seen that a very low colony count was obtained. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p44.59">The average class colony count was over three times more. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p44.59">This could have occurred because the agar was at too a high temperature when the sample was first added and may have killed some of the bacteria cells. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p44.59">This is where the precision of class results shows, due to there being more duplicate plates, anomalies are leveled out. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.59">
<s n="s1.8;p45.59">The MPN test is selective for coliforms. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p45.59">If coliforms are present they grow and produce acid from the glucose in the medium which can cause a colour change to a more yellow colour. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p45.59">Gas is also produced which can be seen as a gas bubble in a Durham tube. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p45.59">For the individual results, the Durham tubes in every bottle showed a gas bubble. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p45.59">The high number of positive tubes for the presumptive coliform count by the MPN method, shows that there were more coliforms present than expected. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p45.59">There was no benefit in this case to work out the MPN as it wouldn't demonstrate anything to us. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p45.59">The class results show a wide variety in the results and give a most probable number between 75 and 11000 of coliforms which is a broad range and does not appear to be very accurate. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p45.59">This is not generally an accurate method. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p46.59">When a colony count is referred to as a total viable count, from the name it is assumed that each colony is formed by a single living organism and by counting the number of colonies will give the number of viable cells present. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.59">Sometimes cell clumping can occur and pairs, chains or clusters of cells will form a colony instead. </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p54.59">

<s n="s2.2;p54.59">This can be seen when comparing the results for pour plate melted PCA individual (using two duplications) and class results (using 9 duplications), the 95% confidence limits as a percent were much smaller for the class results indicating that they were more precise. </s>
</p>
<p n="p55.59">
