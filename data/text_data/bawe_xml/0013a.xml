<s n="s1.12;p11.12">Historians examining the Medieval period had previously over looked the Black Death. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p11.12">Henry only wrote fourteen lines on the subject in a study of twelve volumes. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p11.12">This indicates that the Black Death was not considered to have had a great impact on the history of Europe. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p11.12">Other explanations have been put forward for the decrease in population and the subsequent economic, social and political changes. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p11.12">Colin Platt suggests that 'it was famine not plague, after 1349, that remained the biggest killer'<ref target="BAWE_0013a-ftnote.028"/> in more northern countries. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p11.12">He also comments on the fact that later marriages and families with fewer children was becoming normal practice and that this kept the population down more than the effects of the plague. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p11.12">As there is limited evidence from the period, it is impossible to discern exactly what was killing off so much of the population. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p11.12">Undeniably the plague was present, but its effects may have been exaggerated. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p11.12">Platt claims that 'more monks undoubtedly died of over-weight or of liver conditions than ever succumbed to the plague'<ref target="BAWE_0013a-ftnote.029"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p11.12">Graham Twigg, a zoologist, further suggests that the spread of anthrax was the predominant cause of death in 1348<ref target="BAWE_0013a-ftnote.030"/>. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p11.12">Herlihy examined the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum</hi>, which contained accounts of supposed plague victims. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p11.12">He found that freckles, which were more common to other diseases such as anthrax, not buboes, were the most common symptom described<ref target="BAWE_0013a-ftnote.031"/>. </s>
