<s n="s1.1;p15.32">Regardless of whether we accept or deny one of the two contending perspectives, in any meaningful sense, liberalism is undergoing a series of fundamental challenges under globalisation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.32">
<s n="s1.3;p16.32">First of all, the strongest challenge of globalisation against liberalism comes from Adam Smith's 'invisible hand'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.32">Fundamentally, Adam Smith and David Ricardo assumed capital immobile and only available for national investment. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.32">Smith's 'invisible hand' presupposed the internal relations of community, so that the capitalists feel a 'natural disinclination' to invest abroad (Burchill 1996, 57). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.32">
<s n="s1.4;p17.32">In addition, recurring financial crisis across the continent calls into question on Adam Smith's 'natural order' (Deane 1978, 10) discussed above. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.32">This is the case that globalisation in finance deepened asymmetric interdependence<ref target="BAWE_0293c-endnote.005"/> between advanced states and less-advanced states. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.32">Less-advanced nations have an incentive to the access to huge export markets and advanced nations want an external outlet for domestic capital surplus. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p18.32">The repatriation of capital profit and short-term capital taxation, for example, still remain as a 'hot potato' which irritates liberalists and their adherents. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p19.32">
<s n="s1.3;p19.32">In addition, the over-speeding capital flow only searching cost-productivity and state's deregulation have coerced the domestic industry and labour into structural adjustment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.32">Adam Smith previously asserted that free trade should be gradually phased over a large enough time span to complement the competitiveness of domestic industry and labour (Crane and Amwai 1997, 56). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.32">But this classic liberalist idea was, in practice, ignored by liberalist policy itself because of the worldwide deregulation and the wane of the states' power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.32">
<s n="s1.1;p20.32">Furthermore, international institutions tend to be mobilised by individual states in order to hasten the domestic structural adjustment accompanied by domestic resistance as a result of high unemployment and deepening income inequality in labour market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.32">
<s n="s1.3;p21.32">Indeed, as Keohane depicted as a 'common blind spot'(Keohane 1988, 392), the domestic politics under globalisation was neglected by both game theoretic strategic analysis and structural explanations of international regime (that is, two representative modern liberal approaches). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.32">The validity of the domestic-international dichotomy is fairly arguable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.32">However, it is the case that Laisser - faire policy commonly maintained by liberal thinking in domestic economy exacerbates income inequality and deepens the bipolarisation globalisation cause. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.32">
<s n="s1.2;p22.32">Secondly, the worldwide proliferation of regionalism also cannot be explained by liberal assumptions that free trade enhance the interdependence and finally pacify the inter-state relationship. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.32">The liberalist approach on trade international relations theory begins with fundamental assumption that 'trade wars' both between and within trade blocs is essentially unthinkable (Richardson 1995, 291).<ref target="BAWE_0293c-endnote.007"/> </s>
