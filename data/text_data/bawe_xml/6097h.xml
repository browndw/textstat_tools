<s n="s1.3;p3.42">In 1927, Louis de Broglie effectively discovered what we now call Bohmian Mechanics (other names include the "Pilot Wave model" and the "causal" or "ontological" interpretation of quantum mechanics), and although de Broglie later abandoned this idea, it was rediscovered in 1952 by David Bohm who was the first person genuinely to understand its significance and implications. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.42">However, the roots of the pilot-wave theory trace back to Albert Einstein, even before the discovery of quantum mechanics itself. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.42">Einstein hoped that interference phenomena involving particle-like photons could be explained if the motion of the photons were somehow guided by the electromagnetic field, which would thus play the role of the guiding field (something I will explain later).<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.002"/> It is due to de Broglie's original conception and Bohm's rediscovery of the idea that this interpretation is known today as the de Broglie - Bohm Pilot Wave Theory. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p4.42">Let me first explain what is meant by a hidden-variable theory. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.42">A hidden-variable theory is used by a minority of physicists who argue that the statistical nature of Quantum Mechanics implies that Quantum Mechanics is incomplete. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.42">It is really applicable only to ensembles of particles; new physical phenomena beyond Quantum Mechanics are needed to explain an individual event.<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.003"/> The fact that Quantum Mechanics generally does not predict measurement outcomes with certainty leads us to the conclusion that Quantum Mechanics itself is not deterministic, and it only provides us with the probabilities of the possible outcomes. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.42">Now this leads to the bizarre situation, where measurements of a particular parameter done on two identical systems can yield different results. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.42">It then follows that there might be a more fundamental theory, hidden deep beneath the floor of Quantum Mechanics, that can always predict the outcome of each measurement with certainty - a hidden variable theory. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p26.42">In this interpretation, there is the assumption that there are two processes which influence the wavefunction: the unitary evolution governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation, and the aspect of measurement<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p35.42">One thing the Copenhagen Interpretation does not confront is the problem of what constitutes as a quantum measurement (known as the measurement problem). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p35.42">As stated earlier, it is wrong to regard the measuring apparatus (macroscopic) as separate from the quantum system (microscopic), and thus the Copenhagen Interpretation doesn't seem to distinguish between decoherence (the process whereby the macroscopic systems evolve into a state where interference is for all purposes forbidden<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.017"/>) and collapse (a process whereby the outcome is unpredictable, although the statistical properties of a large number of similar experiments can be calculated<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.018"/>) of the wavefunction. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p35.42">In short, Quantum Theory implies that measurements typically fail to have outcomes of the sort the theory was created to explain. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p35.42">If, as in the Bohmian Interpretation, the description provided by the wavefunction is considered incomplete, then the description of the after-measurement situation includes, as well as the wavefunction, at least the values of the variables that register the result. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p35.42">Hence, there is no measurement problem. </s>

<p n="p36.42">
<s n="s1.5;p36.42">There are a number of reasons as to why the de Broglie - Bohm Theory has not gained as much acceptance among scientists as other theories (namely the Copenhagen Interpretation and Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p36.42">Firstly there is the proposal of the quantum potential. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p36.42">In physics, both classical and quantum potentials arise out of physical interactions between objects, but the quantum potential arises solely out of the mathematics of the Schr√∂dinger equation and has no physical basis. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p36.42">Additionally, the forces associated with the theory violate Newton's third law which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p37.42">The Pilot Wave Theory has subtle problems when incorporating the spin and other concepts of quantum physics: the eigenvalues of the spin are discrete, and therefore contradict the rotational invariance, unless the probabilistic interpretation is accepted.<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.020"/> Bohmian mechanics does not account for phenomena such as the pair creation and annihilation characteristic of Quantum Field Theory. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.42">It also appears to make unnecessary postulates, for example the existence of particle trajectories, which can never be observed more accurately than the uncertainty principle allows.<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.021"/> Although the theory does not require the collapse of the wavefunction in order to explain quantum phenomena, once the measurement is made, the wavefunction must disappear, which seems highly unnatural. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p40.42">In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen argued that a nonlocal hidden variable theory was not only possible, but in fact necessary, proposing the EPR Paradox as proof.<ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.023"/> Additionally, in 1964, John Bell showed that nonlocality is implied by the predictions of Quantum Theory itself. <ref target="BAWE_6097h-ftnote.024"/> </s>

<s n="s2.3;p41.42">The Copenhagen Interpretation does not deal with real particle positions and has thus been formulated in a Lorentz invariant manner. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p41.42">Furthermore, the quantum potential behaves in a nonrelativistic fashion, so Bohmian Mechanics is fine for explaining nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics, but it hasn't been joined to special relativity in a consistent fashion. </s>
