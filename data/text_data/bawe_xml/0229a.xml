<s n="s1.11;p1.16">Modernism is surely the most indefinable movement of the twentieth century. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p1.16">As critics have remarked, it is a concept which 'incorporates major contradictions'. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.11;p1.16">However, a key factor in our understanding of modernism is an awareness of the socio-political, cultural and scientific context of its conception. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p1.16">If we are to define it as a movement which, as Peter Childs argues, was 'primarily located in the years 1890-1930',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.002"/> then there are many notable developments which took place in Germany during this period crucial to the birth of modernism. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p1.16">Indeed, death contributed greatly to this birth. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p1.16">According to one website, '1,773,000' soldiers died and '11,000,000 mobilized' and '4,216,000 injured'<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.003"/> men arrived home in the defeated Germany in 1914. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.16">More positively, the 1919 National Constitutional Assembly elections<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.004"/> led to the 'right to vote'<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.005"/> being given to women, who, six years later, represented over a third of the working population. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p1.16">Moreover, female emancipation occurred not only in political and professional realms, but also in the sphere of sexual relationships. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p1.16">The creation of 'die neue Frau' was influenced by the 'free sexuality' encouraged by the Berlin and Munich cabaret scenes; in addition, the arrival of sexual health clinics meant that women were no longer confined to the roles of housewife and mother imposed on them by the former Imperial state.<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.006"/> Indeed, Weimar Germany embraced the presence of both low and high culture, just as it questioned the hierarchy inherent in the German marriage, as Theodor Van der Velde's guide to marriage, <hi rend="underlined">Die volkommene Ehe</hi>, testifies<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p1.16">In contrast to the artistically dubious cabaret, several creative movements, some essentially part of Modernism, others in conflict with it, formed throughout Europe in the early twentieth century. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p1.16">In Germany, one can note the concept of the 'socially critical'<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.008"/> Neue Sachlichkeit, Expressionism and its focus on the highly personal subjectivity of the emotions,<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.009"/> as well as the Expressionist painters who formed 'die Bruecke' and 'die blaue Reiter' groups, and the Bauhaus movement, with its admiration of the New York skyscrapers.<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.010"/> Meanwhile, figures such as Einstein, Planck, Max Born and Johnny von Neumann were making progress in the scientific world.<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.011"/> It is these socio-political, cultural and scientific advancements which I shall consider in analysing the extent to which <hi rend="underlined">Metropolis</hi> and <hi rend="underlined">Der blaue Engel</hi> can be called modernist. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p2.16">If, as Peter Childs declares, 'Modernism can be taken as a response by artists and writers to several things, including industrialisation, urban society, war, technological change and new philosophical ideas',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.012"/> then <hi rend="underlined">Metropolis</hi> is certainly a modernist film. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.16">Certainly, while it is set in the year 2000, it is the developments of the late nineteenth, and early twentieth, century which Lang exhibits in our first glimpses of the city Metropolis. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.16">Clearly, its planes, trains and automobiles reflect the urbanised, heavily populated London, Paris, or Berlin at the turn of the century, and its skyscrapers, due to America's influence on the Bauhaus artists, suggest more than a little nod to those of the modern New York. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.16">This first overview of Metropolis, then, suggests the positive side of man's progress in technology. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.16">As the skyscrapers and planes symbolically indicate, and which one critic has pointed out, man is literally reaching for the skies.<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.013"/> But where is man? </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.16">A closer look at this <hi rend="italic">mise-en-scene</hi> implies, ironically, that what man has created has become more powerful than man himself. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.16">Indeed, man is present in this scene, but purely either to have his individuality suppressed by being part of one of those 'formal geometrical structures',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.014"/> so favoured by the architect in Lang, or literally to be relegated to the sidelines, making way for the car filled streets, devoid of people, in centre frame. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.16">Clearly, we must possess double vision when watching <hi rend="underlined">Metropolis</hi>, admiring man's industrial advancement and yet simultaneously questioning the cost of this advancement, remembering E. M. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.16">Forster's belief in the tyranny of the machine<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.015"/> and the fact that behind these planes, trains and automobiles lies the ghost of the tank, man's creation in order to destroy only himself during World War One. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.16">Thus, the triumphant soundtrack to this scene, if not ironic insofar as it declares man's progress in technology, nonetheless belies the catastrophe which awaits man as a result of this progress. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p3.16">Their black attire, squadron-esque formations and bowed heads support one critic's argument that they are 'more machines than human beings',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.016"/> and our first view of the Heart Machine, in which the workers perform a choreographed dance within the machine, emphasises this. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.16">Evidently, they exist purely to work and are literally mere cogs in the machine, empowering with 'every revolution of a machine wheel',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.017"/> as an intertitle puts it, their superiors in the city of Metropolis above them. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.16">The social divide between the working class and the upper class is emphasised in several ways. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.16">Firstly, as one critic has suggested, 'architecture in Lang expresses [....] the hierarchy of classes',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.018"/> and the fact that our first glimpse of the workers has them descending to work in a lift highlights their inferiority. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.16">It is an inferiority nonetheless beautifully emphasised by the descending, altar poem-esque intertitle, 'Deep below the earth's surface lay the workers' city'.<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.019"/> Secondly, the games scene in the 'Club of the Sons' shows that the upper class delights in its freedom of movement for its own sake, as opposed to the stiff movements of the workers illustrating how fettered they are to their machines. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.16">Lastly, the physicality of these sportsmen, highlighted by their wearing white, is enjoyed not only in sport of a competitive, but also of a sexual, nature, supported by Freder's frolicking with a half-naked woman in an Eden-esque garden. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.16">This is in clear contrast to the workers, whose sexual exploits are evidently limited to procreation, as we see no women in their lives until anarchy has broken out. </s>
