<s n="s2.3;p1.30">Yet, when we impose values on food commodities and food-related activities, we ironically empower them to empower or disempower us. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.30">In a more simplistic manner, food has the ability to "distinguish and to discriminate, include and exclude"<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.001"/>; it demarcates ethnic, class, racial, wealth and national boundaries. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.30">As a result, food has become a useful tool of analysis because it can capture the dynamic shifts in various social identities we possess over time and place. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.30">Warren Belasco neatly encapsulates food as a fluid tool of analysis in that "food...does not merely symbolise or represent in the static sense but rather moves, penetrates and transforms." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s3.6;p2.30">Hence it is the task of historians, sociologists and anthropologists to capture this change in its entirety by "moving beyond food as a metaphor and cultural symbol"<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.003"/>; analysing food in the structure it resides in. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.30">In effect, food becomes an important subject of analysis when we situate the analysis of food in a social context. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.30">Analysing food discourses will reveal social structures, patterns, unity and disunity. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.30">It is indeed the ideal tool and subject of analysis that will allow the practitioner in this domain to unravel cleavages, alignments and identities between people, societies and nations. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p3.30">Till this stage in time, food as a field of study has been firmly established and the "transformation of food from a marginal subject of interest to a few agricultural historians to one recognised for its potential for exploring new dimensions of the past is now almost complete." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s3.4;p3.30">Inevitably, the popularity and credibility of food-centred discourses have in turn made this field "more specific and particular"<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.005"/> yet "more general and comprehensive." </s>

<p n="p4.30">
<s n="s1.7;p4.30">Essentially, the essay will reveal how food illuminates national cleavages as much as national solidarities in two parts. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.30">The first part of the essay will focus on food as a subject of analysis and provide a historical perspective on how food creates and divides people, societies and nations in two Latin American countries, Mexico and Belize. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.30">This section will also provide a more in depth definitional analysis of "cuisine" and "nation", providing the essay with a functional theoretical framework to work with. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.30">The next part of the essay will adopt food as a tool of analysis through the use of an unconventional means of examining a food blog, to reinforce the thematic concerns of this essay. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.30">This section will provide a contemporary perspective on how food and food-related activities, such as food blogging reveal cleavages as much as they conceal and deconstruct them. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.30">While both sections are structurally different, they reinforce each other through common issues discussed and themes revealed. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.30">The former section affirms the centrality of food to nation-building in Latin America through a historical account of the development of national cuisines in both Mexico and Belize while the latter provides a contemporary discussion on the role and importance of food through a Latin American food blog. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">A Historical Approach </head>
<p n="p5.30">
<s n="s1.2;p5.30">The national divisive or integrative ability of food will be examined historically with regards to two countries; Belize and Mexico. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.30">These two case studies are sufficiently diverse to encapsulate unique nation-building experiences, yet both are structurally and historically similar to entail a comparative study of the role of food in creating or uniting national cleavages. </s>

<p n="p6.30">
<s n="s1.6;p6.30">"Belize is an interesting place to look at food, globalisation and nationalism" as Richard Wilk asserted rightly, "because it is one of the least likely places where you would expect to find a national cuisine." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s2.6;p6.30">Since colonial times, Belize's demographic composition has hindered nationalism as it is populated entirely by immigrants, of whom "many...have shed their ethnic and national identities".<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.009"/> Despite this obstacle, Belizean cuisine has evolved to encompass rice and beans, both of which combined, epitomised a Creole cuisine. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.30">In a similar light, the cultural history of food in Mexico has definitely revealed more ethnic, class and racial cleavages during the Spanish Conquest than in its post-independence years. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.30">Jeffrey Pilcher has extensively traced the "long and contentious process"<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.010"/> of the making of a Mexican national cuisine in his book, ¡<hi rend="italic">Que Vivan los Tamales</hi>! </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.30">This national development in Mexico mirrors that of Belize in that the final national cuisine that emerges is a distinctive mestizo cuisine - <hi rend="italic">Mole Poblano.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.30">It is the fusion of regional culinary delights that forges Mexico's national identity. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p7.30">Before we analyse the role of food in processes of nation building; it is vital that we set workable definitions for "nations" first and then "cuisines", leading up to the conception of "national cuisines" which epitomises the centrality of food in nation building processes. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.30">In Benedict Anderson's definition, a nation is "an imagined political community and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s3.7;p7.30">It is <hi rend="italic">imagined</hi> because the "nation" is a concept that every member within it acknowledges yet the "members of the nations will never know most of their fellow members, meet them or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s4.7;p7.30">It is also <hi rend="italic">limited</hi> because the "nation" shares borders with other nations and only has jurisdiction over itself and its boundaries, "beyond which lie other nations". </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s5.7;p7.30">Lastly, it is also "sovereign" because as a nation, it holds the exclusive right to exercise supreme political authority over a geographic region which encompasses a group of people.<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.014"/> Extending this line of thought, nationalism is an ideological belief in the sovereign right of the nation which further legitimises the existence of nations. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.30">In multiethnic nations, nationalism remains an ideology torn by many cleavages, ethnic, class, region, religion and race. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.30">As such, Ernest Gellner makes a robust point alluding to the importance of a national cuisine within a nation: "one of the most central claims of nationalism is that the nation should be a single political and cultural unit, that the territorial state should also have a national cuisine". <ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.015"/> </s>

<s n="s3.11;p25.30">As noted earlier, national cuisines function mostly in the minds of people, hence it is crucial that people are actively engaged in sustaining a cuisine by "using ingredients, methods and recipes on a regular basis to produce both their everyday and festive foods, eating the same diet more or less consistently and sharing what they cook with each other." </s>

<s n="s6.11;p25.30">More strikingly, the symbolism of food comes along with culinary events and festivals and her coverage on the Holy Week illuminates this connection. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p25.30">She emphasizes the importance of the Holy Week which comes about from the fusion of three main influences, "...indigenous, European, African, and the role of the Catholic Church in Latin American popular culture." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0137k-ftnote.053"/>
<s n="s8.11;p25.30">Extending from the fusion of food cultures to a fusion of ethnic cultures, she expressed that "Spanish (and Portuguese) conquerors brought their religious beliefs with them when they came to the Americas, and these beliefs blended with the beliefs of the indigenous tribes in this part of the hemisphere at that time... </s>
<s n="s9.11;p25.30">At the end, those are the factors which have blended along centuries to give Latin America a unique culture of its own." </s>

<s n="s10.11;p25.30">Ultimately, food customs are derived from the national cultural context they are embedded within. </s>

<p n="p27.30">
<s n="s1.4;p27.30">At this stage, it is vital that we recall the vastness of this domain of food studies. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.30">The infinite nature of the discourse at hand empowers us to select only certain tools of analysis for certain aspects of study. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.30">Essentially, the essay has focused on the analysis of food and its role in creating, reinforcing, bridging and fusing national cleavage. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.30">With this thematic issue in mind, the entire essay has examined such forces of unity or disunity within the regional framework of Latin America from two distinct yet complementary approaches. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.30">
<s n="s1.8;p28.30">The first approach provides a historical overview on the development of national cuisines in both Mexico and Belize. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p28.30">In this respect, food emerges as a subject of enquiry more than a tool of analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p28.30">The comparative analyses of the culinary regimes and national cuisine formation processes in Mexico and Belize have revealed similar trends. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p28.30">In the early stages of national cuisine formation, food actually reveals and creates more cleavages in society; food habits and preferences often reflect and demarcate clear ethnic and racial divisions within a multiethnic context of a colonial regime. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p28.30">Yet food also has the complementary ability to unite societies. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p28.30">In the final stages leading up to the emergence of a coherent national cuisine, food may become the emblem of national unity. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p28.30">The fact is that both Belize and Mexico emerged with a creolized national cuisine that fused regional, ethnic and racial cleavages. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p28.30">In this light, the divisive or integrative power of food becomes a fluid concept, suggesting the ability of food to assert either role over time. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.30">
<s n="s1.9;p29.30">While the first approach encapsulates the fluid ability of food to divide or unite nations, the second approach views food-related entities and food-centred activities as important tools of analysis which swing back to the fact that food is an important subject of enquiry. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p29.30">Food historians have often adopted a diverse array of sources for insight into culinary regimes; these sources include cookbooks, travel narratives, literature and paintings. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p29.30">Moving away from these traditional sources of analyses, this essay has adopted a food blog as a tool of analysis which has some crucial implications. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p29.30">Firstly, the importance of a food blog derives from it being a modern manifestation of a cookbook, fulfilling the traditional purposes of a cookbook and uniting the nation through an exchange of recipes and common culinary experiences. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p29.30">Secondly, the importance of a food blog stems from the related activity of food-blogging which creates a community of "foodies" that ushers in multiple perspectives, ranging from the personal to the political. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p29.30">In turn, this affirms the multidisciplinary nature of this field and opens up new possibilities and directions for the historian, anthropologist, sociologist and many more. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p29.30">Taken together, food blogs and food blogging become viable means of sustaining national cuisines. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p29.30">A national cuisine cannot exist unless there is a community of people who eat it, cook it, have opinions about it and engage in dialogue about it. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p29.30">In effect, an active national cuisine translates into national solidarity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.30">
<s n="s1.3;p30.30">In all, the thematic concern of the essay has been holistically addressed through two distinctive yet complementary modes of enquiry. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.30">The conclusion is simple yet complex. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.30">Food may create national cleavages however they acknowledge, conceal and fuse them to a far greater extent such that food unites nations more than divides them in reality. </s>
