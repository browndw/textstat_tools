<s n="s1.1;p1.66">The objective of this study was to analyse chocolate purchases with respect to individual supermarkets, types of chocolate and customer characteristics. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.66">
<s n="s1.3;p2.66">The independent sample t-test was chosen to test the null hypothesis that 'customers with kids spend the same amount on chocolate as those without' because it compares two means within the same variable. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.66">It tests whether the two means are equal or alternatively if they show a significant difference. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.66">The T-test is based on the assumption that the sample mean is normally distributed across the sample. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.66">
<s n="s1.4;p3.66">The ANOVA F test was chosen to find out whether the amount spent on chocolate is significantly different across 3 categories of TV watchers (light, medium and heavy). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.66">This test is appropriate because it can compare several means simultaneously while avoiding the error that may occur in performing multiple t-tests. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.66">The null hypothesis is that all the means are equal and it is rejected if one of them differs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.66">The F (Fisher) ratio compares the variance within sample groups with the variance between groups and is the basis for ANOVA. If the calculated F value is more than the critical F value then H0 (the means are equal) is rejected and H1(there is a significant difference between the means) is accepted. </s>

<p n="p4.66">
<s n="s1.1;p4.66">This test assumes that the sample is normally distributed and has equal variances. </s>

</p>
<p n="p6.66">
<s n="s1.1;p6.66">If the P value is greater than alpha (which depends on the significance level) then the results are statistically significant and can therefore be used to draw conclusions. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p9.66">The widest confidence interval is for fair trade chocolate within the 56-70 age group, this is due to the smaller sample size, which makes the results more difficult to replicate. </s>

<p n="p42.66">
<s n="s1.2;p42.66">From the results of task 1 it can be concluded that, in general terms the 56-70 age group spend the most on chocolate therefore marketing strategies in general should concentrate on this age bracket. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p42.66">However, general advice may not be particularly helpful as this pattern varies for each individual supermarket. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.66">
<s n="s1.3;p43.66">The case of Sainsbury follows the general pattern with the 56-70 age group spending the most on chocolate and therefore marketing strategies focusing on this age range are likely to benefit Sainsbury. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p43.66">It is also important for Sainsbury to know their market segment age-groups for each chocolate type in order to decide how to focus their marketing strategies. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p43.66">The 56-70 age group showed the highest expenditure for organic chocolate and the 41-55 age range for organic and fair trade chocolate. </s>

<p n="p44.66">
<s n="s1.2;p44.66">The results of the independent sample T-test showed that kids were an influential factor in determining the amount spent on fair trade and organic chocolate but there was no significant difference in expenditure for standard chocolate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p44.66">Again this pattern varies for each supermarket. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.66">
<s n="s1.1;p45.66">For Sainsbury, the results from the independent samples t tests were only significant for fair-trade chocolate where customers having kids' was seen to make a significant positive difference to the amount spent on this chocolate type. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.66">
<s n="s1.3;p46.66">It would therefore be profitable for Sainsbury to encourage more customers with kids to shop at the store and at the same time retain existing customers with kids as there is evidence that they spend more on at least one type of chocolate than those without kids. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.66">One incentive to get customers with children shopping in Sainsbury might be to introduce a kids section of the supermarket. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p46.66">Existing customers with kids can be retained through promotions linked to loyalty schemes, for example sending them samples to promote new fair-trade products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.66">
<s n="s1.2;p47.66">In the knowledge that customers with kids spend more on fair-trade chocolate Sainsbury could develop marketing strategies focusing on this target segment, for example an advertising campaign directed at children promoting fair trade chocolate in a way that fits their desires. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p47.66">A simpler method could be to put fair-trade chocolate at a lower position on the shelves, at a child's eye level as oppose to an adults. </s>

<p n="p48.66">
<s n="s1.1;p48.66">The results of the ANOVA F-tests showed that over all of the supermarkets in general, the amount of hours of TV watched is a relevant factor is explaining fair-trade and organic chocolate expenditure but not standard chocolate expenditure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.66">
<s n="s1.7;p49.66">For Sainsbury the one way ANOVA tests were shown to be insignificant for fair trade and standard chocolate types therefore no conclusions can be drawn specifically for these. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p49.66">However, the number of hours of TV watched was found to be a relevant factor in explaining the organic chocolate expenditure of Sainsbury's customers. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p49.66">The graphs show how the means differ. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p49.66">Customers who watch 1-12 hours of TV a week spend the most on organic chocolate. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p49.66">Those who do not watch television do not buy the chocolate at all therefore it might be advisable for Sainsbury to develop a television advertisement (to capture its target audience) promoting organic chocolate. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p49.66">Watching TV and eating chocolate is often done together. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p49.66">People often buy chocolate to eat whilst watching a film so other marketing strategies could include displaying some chocolate with the videos sold in the stores or linking them in promotions such as; rent this DVD and get a free bar of fair-trade or organic chocolate. </s>
