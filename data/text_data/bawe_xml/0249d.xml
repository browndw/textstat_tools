<head rend="bold">Author's Assessment of the Project</head>
<p>The engineering data obtained from the literature searches was very limited. In this report the author has designed simple experimental rigs. These rigs successfully demonstrated the engineering principles of fluerics. The rig design allowed the author to illustrate the effects on flow attachment for a range of geometric profiles. The work carried out to date should be considered the beginning of a more detailed investigation that considers other aspects such as fluid flow rates and pressures as well as general fluid conditions. The author had insufficient time to consider what effect changes of fluid properties would have on the jet attachment. </p>
<p>This work is important as it showed that the jet attachment principle operated for different fluids (water and air being tested). It showed that the principle applied to different geometries and to different fluids. Thus the usefulness of the principle is not limited to either gaseous or liquid fluids. The tests showed that great accuracy in manufacture is not necessary for successful jet attachment and switching. Nor are exotic materials required, making this a principal that should be easy to use, simple and cheap to manufacture. </p>
<p>The work of this project should be continued to determine:- </p>
<p rend="bulleted">What effect do different geometric profiles have on the point of attachment </p>
<p rend="bulleted">What effect do these same geometries have on the strength of jet attachment. </p>
<p>These are only a couple of examples for further investigation. Taking this forward will provide designers with empirical data for designing the profiles to give the most appropriate jet attachment conditions for a range of applications ( i.e. what profiles provide strong attachment, what profile of bleeds or valve shape provide rapid switching, what is the range of angles for the segments over which the unit operates satisfactorily). </p>
<p>The work was a success in that:- </p>
<p rend="bulleted">An extensive literature was carried out and some examples of the use of fluerics were identified </p>
<p rend="bulleted">Simple rigs were designed with variable geometric profile features. </p>
<p rend="bulleted">Rapid prototyping proved a viable method of manufacture for flueric devices. </p>
<p rend="bulleted">The rigs demonstrated jet attachment and jet switching for gaseous and liquid fluids. </p>
<p rend="bulleted">The design of the rigs permits other profiles to be tested. </p>
<p>The extent of the experimental work completed is not as great as originally expected. The author found obtaining information on past experimentation very difficult, with the result that a considerable time was spent searching for data than planned. This reduced the time spent on testing. </p>
<p>The rigs had to be a limited overall size to use the preferred manufacturing technique (rapid prototyping). Thus the scale of model used for the testing was predetermined. There was no scope in the available time to consider alternative, larger rigs. </p>
<p>Flow rates and pressures of the fluid flows were not measured. Whilst efforts were made to minimise variations in flow and pressure fluctuations these could not be eliminated completely during the project test phase. </p>

<hi rend="bold">Turbulent Flow:</hi> see section 3.1.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Vortices</hi> are rotational flows present within turbulent fluids</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Cavitation</hi> is the generation of bubbles which instantaneously release large amounts of energy when the bubble collapses.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Laminar Flow</hi>: see section 3.1.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Real Flow</hi> is the flow that actually exists, for which any calculation is approximate and is often simplified to make calculations less complicated.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Ideal Flow</hi> is frictionless and incompressible. This can be a useful model for analysing large expanses of fluid for instance aeronautical or marine engineering.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Frictionless Fluid</hi> by its very nature is non-viscous and its processes are reversible. There is no such thing as frictionless fluid however, and this is used simply as a model for improved understanding of real flow.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Boundary Layer</hi> is that band of fluid between the vessel wall and the main fluid flow; the main fluid flow is considered independent of the shear or friction effects of the fluid passing over the vessel wall. The boundary layer is affected by these shear or friction effects. The fluid in direct contact with the vessel boundary has zero velocity relative to the boundary; the subsequent velocity gradient throughout the boundary layer is dependant upon the viscous shear. Boundary layers can be laminar or turbulent, and is dependant upon several functions <ref target="BAWE_0249d-ftnote.037"/>

<p>All play a part in deciding whether the boundary layer is laminar, turbulent, or indeed at some stage in transformation between the two.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Adiabatic Flow</hi> is flow where there is no exchange of heat, neither to, nor from the fluid. When modelling frictionless flow, where processes are reversible, if the fluid is also adiabatic, it is said to be isentropic.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Steady Flow</hi> occurs when conditions at any point in the fluid do not change with time i.e. velocities at every point remain constant indefinitely.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.012"/>
</p>
<p>The definition also implies there is no change in density, pressure or temperature</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.013"/>, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.014"/>, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.015"/>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Steady Turbulent Flow</hi> exists when the mean velocity throughout the fluid remains constant. Due to the turbulence there will of course be minor fluctuations, and so the temporal mean velocity is defined as:-</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.016"/>
</p>
<p>Similarly, the same must be said of pressure, density, temperature etc, (substituting the v in the equation for the relevant descriptor, be it p, σ or t).</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Unsteady Flow</hi> occurs when the conditions above, are not met.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Uniform Flow</hi> is common in pipe flow. It is defined by:-</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.017"/>
</p>
<p>i.e. where the velocity vector at every point in the flow is equal and constant. This cannot occur in any real flow due to the boundary layer, but the definition is applied nonetheless, even though the velocity vector at the boundary is always zero. In this case, the more general definition is applied:</p>
<quote lang="English">"When all parallel cross sections through the conduit are identical and the average velocity at each cross section is the same at any given instant, the flow is said to be uniform."</quote>
<p>Again, flow that does not meet this condition is said to be non-uniform flow.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">2-Dimensional Flow</hi> is a model that assumes within a 3d flow, that all particles must flow in parallel planes along identical paths in each of these planes, with no changes in flow normal to these planes. Analysis of this flow is considerably easier, and in the instance of CFD, minimises computational time. </p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">3-Dimensional Flow</hi> is the flow that occurs most commonly due to turbulence and geometry of flow. Methods of analysis are generally complex mathematically, and only simple geometrical flow boundaries may be handled.</p>
<p>A <hi rend="bold">Streamline</hi> is a continuous line drawn through the fluid so that it has the direction of the velocity vector at every point. There can be no flow across a streamline.</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249d-form.018"/>
</p>
<p>Regardless of nature of flows, all flows are subject to the following relationships:</p>
<p rend="ordered">Newton's laws of motion must hold for every particle at every instant</p>
<p rend="ordered">The continuity relationship, i.e. the law of conservation of mass</p>
<p rend="ordered">The first and second laws of thermodynamics</p>
<p rend="ordered">Boundary conditions, analytical statements that a real fluid has zero velocity relative to a boundary at a boundary or that ideal fluids cannot penetrate a boundary.</p>
