<s n="s1.5;p1.15">When modifying their economy's output level, governments often resort to fiscal policy: manipulating government-spending and taxation to influence overall economic output. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.15">Whilst it has been described as "the central reason for impressive economic growth"<ref target="BAWE_0139h-ftnote.001"/> in some economies, fiscal policy is not always completely functional, however. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.15">Its effectiveness is variable, and primarily depends on the size of government-spending and taxation multipliers and on the extent of an economy's crowding-out (to what degree an increase in private spending in the goods-market - triggered by tax cuts or boosted government expenditure - is undesirably countered in the money-market by a drop in investment and an increase in savings). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.15">The size of crowding-out and of these multipliers varies with the slopes of the IS and LM curves, as economies reach equilibrium where IS=LM. These slopes in turn depend on an economy's sensitivity of investment to both income and interest rate, its marginal propensity to consume, its income-tax levels, and its sensitivity of money demand to both income and interest rate. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.15">Mathematically and economically analyzing each of these components will hopefully yield insight into the use and effectiveness of fiscal policy in today's economies. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p2.15">Equilibrium in an economy's goods-market is expressed by the IS curve, which follows the equation Y = [(Co - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>T + b <hi rend="sub">0</hi> + G) / (1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)] - [(b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> / 1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) i], where Y is total output, Co is autonomous (or income-free) spending, C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> is marginal propensity to consume (the fraction of every additional unit of income that people choose to spend rather than save), b <hi rend="sub">0</hi> is autonomous investment, b <hi rend="sub">1</hi> is the sensitivity of investment to income, b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> is the sensitivity of investment to interest rate, and i is the interest rate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.15">As G (government-spending) and T (taxes) are also central to this equation, fiscal policy - changes in G or T - clearly affects an economy's goods-market equilibrium. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.2;p3.15">Fiscal policy also impacts <hi rend="italic">money-market</hi> equilibrium as, by modifying demand for money in the goods-market, it affects the price of bonds and therefore the money-market's interest rate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.15">Money-market equilibrium (where real money demand equals real money supply) lies along the LM curve, which follows the equation i = (M/ d <hi rend="sub">2</hi>P) + (d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>/ d <hi rend="sub">2</hi>)Y, where d <hi rend="sub">1</hi> is the sensitivity of money demand to income, d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> is the sensitivity of money demand to the interest rate, P is the price level, M is money supply and Y is income or the economy's output level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.1;p4.15">When the IS and LM equations are solved simultaneously, they produce an income level Y <hi rend="sub"> e</hi> at interest rate i <hi rend="sub">e</hi> (Graph 1) where both the goods and money-markets are in equilibrium: Ye = [(Co - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>T + b <hi rend="sub">0</hi>+ G)+ b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (M/P)] / [ d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> + d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (1 -C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)] </s>

<s n="s1.8;p5.15">Both IS and LM therefore impact fiscal policy's effectiveness. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.15">Expansionary fiscal policy, involving increasing spending (G) or decreasing taxes (T), would for instance shift the IS curve to the right (increasing output to Y <hi rend="sub">1</hi> in Graph 2). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.15">To return to equilibrium (where IS once again equals LM) the economy undergoes the following automatic responses: the increase in IS triggers excess money demand of Y <hi rend="sub">e</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">1</hi> (A B), which makes it less attractive to withhold money as bonds. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.15">Demand for bonds therefore drops, decreasing bonds' price, which in turn causes the interest rate to rise (i <hi rend="sub">e</hi> to i <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, B C). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.15">This rise increases returns to saving as well as the cost of investment - as a result, investment drops while savings rise, withdrawing money from the economy's circulation and thus reducing spending. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.15">Output therefore moves back down (C D), settling the economy's new equilibrium output level at Y <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.15">This drop in output is a result of the crowding-out effect, by which increased government-spending boosts private spending but counter-availingly decreases private investment. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.15">The larger crowding-out is, the less effective fiscal policy therefore becomes. </s>

<head rend="italic">Graph 2: Effect of expansionary fiscal policy</head>

<p n="p6.15">

<p n="p7.15">
<s n="s1.3;p7.15">Comparing a relatively flat LM curve (LM <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) to the far steeper LM <hi rend="sub">2</hi> suggests that, for the same shift in IS and the same resulting excess demand for money (Y <hi rend="sub">2</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">B</hi>), there is much less crowding-out in the LM <hi rend="sub">1</hi> case. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.15">The interest rate has to rise by less to choke off EDM - i <hi rend="sub">e</hi> increases to i <hi rend="sub">1</hi> rather than to i <hi rend="sub">2</hi> - and therefore the government's increased spending has less of a counteracting effect on the money-market: total output is reduced by Y <hi rend="sub">B</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">1</hi> rather than by Y <hi rend="sub">B</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.15">Crowding-out is therefore lower and fiscal policy more effective when the LM curve has a smaller slope. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0139h-fig.004">
<head rend="italic">Graph 4: Comparative slopes of IS</head>
</figure>
<p n="p8.15">
<s n="s1.5;p8.15">Comparing a set of shallow IS curves (IS <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and IS <hi rend="sub">1'</hi>) to a steeper set (IS <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and IS <hi rend="sub">2'</hi>) above indicates that the <hi rend="italic">IS</hi> curve's slope also impacts fiscal policy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.15">If both sets shift by the same amount due to equal increases in government-spending (dG), the resulting EDM in the IS <hi rend="sub">1</hi> case (Y <hi rend="sub">e</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">1a</hi>) far exceeds that in the IS <hi rend="sub">2</hi> case (Y <hi rend="sub">e</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">2a</hi>). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.15">Nevertheless, fiscal policy remains more effective with IS <hi rend="sub">1:</hi> the amount by which output then drops back (Y <hi rend="sub">1a</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) is a smaller fraction of the original output increase (Y <hi rend="sub">e</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">1a</hi>) than in the I <hi rend="sub">2</hi> case, where crowding-out is almost complete (Y <hi rend="sub">2a</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">2</hi> is very nearly as large as the initial spending increase, Y <hi rend="sub">e</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">2a</hi>). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.15">Following the same dG, the shallower IS curves therefore settle at a higher equilibrium output than the steeper ones (Y <hi rend="sub">1</hi> compared to Y <hi rend="sub">2</hi>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.15">Crowding-out is thus lower and fiscal policy more effective the shallower the IS curve is. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.15">
<s n="s1.9;p9.15">These conclusions are confirmed by a more economic analysis of the IS and LM curves' slopes. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p9.15">The LM curve, firstly, follows the equation i = (M/ d <hi rend="sub">2</hi>P) + (d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>/ d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> )Y, where (d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>/ d <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is the slope. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p9.15">Mathematically, a smaller slope implies a low d <hi rend="sub">1</hi> value and a high d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> value. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p9.15">As d <hi rend="sub">1</hi> represents sensitivity of money demand to income, the smaller it is, the less EDM can result from the increased income generated by government-spending boosts or tax cuts. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p9.15">Lower EDM implies that holding illiquid money is not so costly, so demand for bonds, and therefore their price, do not fall as much. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p9.15">Accordingly, interest rate does not rise as much, and thus does not inhibit investment or attract savings as much. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p9.15">Output therefore drops by less - fiscal modifications in the goods-market have a smaller 'spill-over' effect into the money-market, and crowding-out is lower. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p9.15">A high d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (sensitivity of money demand to interest rate) further reduces crowding-out by enabling the increasing interest rate (B C in Graph 2) to choke off the excess money demand more efficiently; interest rate must therefore rise less to return the economy to equilibrium, again lessening fiscal policy's counterproductive effects on investment and savings. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p9.15">A low d <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and a high d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> - or a flatter LM curve - indeed render fiscal policy more effective. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.5;p10.15">The IS curve, in turn, has a slope of [(1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) / b <hi rend="sub">2</hi>]. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.15">Mathematically, higher values of C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and b <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and higher values of b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> all yield a flatter slope. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.15">Economically, higher marginal propensity to consume (C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) and higher sensitivity of investment to income (b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) coincide with more effective fiscal policy because government additions to consumers' incomes are spent or invested more readily, thus increasing output as desired. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.15">Moreover, a low b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (sensitivity of investment to interest rate) lessens crowding-out, as the unavoidable increase in interest rates resulting from EDM (B C in Graph 2) has less of an inhibitory effect on investment; output therefore lowers less (C D), reducing crowding-out. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.15">Fiscal policy is thus more effective the smaller b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> is and the larger b <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> are, or the steeper the IS curve is. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.15">
<s n="s1.5;p11.15">Beside the IS and LM curves' slopes, an economy's tax and government-spending multipliers significantly impact fiscal policy's effectiveness. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.15">The higher these multipliers are, the more increases in consumer income (generated through welfare benefits or tax cuts) will affect output. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.15">If, for instance, government-spending increases consumer income by dG, a high government multiplier will cause consumers to spend a large fraction of this new income on goods; the sellers of those goods will then themselves experience an increase in income, part of which they will in turn spend, and so on. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.15">Accordingly, high tax or government multipliers increase output by more than the initial fiscal policy move (Y <hi rend="sub">0</hi>Y <hi rend="sub">1</hi> or Z <hi rend="sub">0</hi>Z <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, as shown via an equilateral triangle, is greater than dG). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.15">These multipliers are therefore vital to this policy's effectiveness. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0139h-fig.005">
<head rend="italic">Graph 5: the Multiplier Effect</head>
</figure>
<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.2;p12.15">The government-spending multiplier is the partial derivative of the IS-LM function with respect to G. As this function, Ye = [(Co - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>T + b <hi rend="sub">0</hi> + G) + b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (M/P)] / [d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> + d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)], inaccurately assumes that all taxes T are flat, it has been rewritten to account for proportional taxes such as income-tax as well. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.15">When T = To + T <hi rend="sub">1</hi>Y, </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.7;p13.15">Ye = [(Co - <hi rend="italic">C1T0</hi> + b <hi rend="sub">0</hi> + G) + b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (M/P)] / [d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> + d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> <hi rend="italic">+ C1T1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)]. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.15">The government-spending multiplier is therefore [d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> / (d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> + d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> + C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>T <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)]. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.15">Mathematically, the multiplier is bigger as d <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and b <hi rend="sub">1</hi> increase and as d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and T <hi rend="sub">1</hi> drop. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.15">This is confirmed economically: a higher marginal propensity to consume (C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) and sensitivity of investment to income (b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) augment the importance of government-spending, as more of the latter is spent by consumers. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.15">A lower tax rate (T <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) also allows more to be consumed following a rise in income. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.15">Also, a lower sensitivity of money demand to income (d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>) reduces the amount of EDM caused by increased government-spending - interest rates must rise less in response, reducing crowding-out. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.15">Lastly, less sensitivity of investment to interest rate (b <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) also reduces crowding-out by allowing EDM to be choked off with less of an interest rate increase. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.15">
<s n="s1.4;p14.15">The tax multiplier (differentiating with respect to T <hi rend="sub">0</hi>) is very similar: [-C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> / (d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>b <hi rend="sub">2</hi> + d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> (1 - C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> + C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>T <hi rend="sub">1</hi> - b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>)]. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.15">It therefore increases in much the same way as the government-spending multiplier. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.15">As C <hi rend="sub">1</hi> is a fraction, the tax multiplier's numerator (C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>d <hi rend="sub">2</hi>) is nonetheless smaller than the government multiplier's numerator (d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> alone), and thus the whole multiplier is smaller. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.15">Expansionary fiscal policy may accordingly affect consumer behaviour more when undertaken as a welfare increase than when it results from tax cuts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.15">
<s n="s1.3;p15.15">Having analysed the parameters C <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, T <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, b <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, b <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, d <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, and d <hi rend="sub">2</hi> in the context of crowding-out and of both the IS-LM curves' slopes and the government-spending and taxation multipliers, one can therefore assert that, economically as well as mathematically, fiscal policy's effectiveness is greatly dependent on these variables. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.15">Higher marginal propensity to consume, sensitivity of investment to interest rate, and sensitivity of money demand to income all enhance fiscal policy's effects, whilst increases in income-tax levels, sensitivity of investment to income, and sensitivity of money demand to interest rate all reduce fiscal effectiveness. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.15">Armed with such conclusions, we must however remain cautious when applying them to today's world, as, in an environment of externally-managed, corruption-weakened and culturally biased economies, economic theories pertaining to government policy are seldom fully reflected in practice. </s>
