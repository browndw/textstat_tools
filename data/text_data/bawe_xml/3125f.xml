<p n="p1.6">
<s n="s1.5;p1.6">In this reflective review I will firstly give an outline of our group presentation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.6">I will then identify the most interesting aspect and the most significant learning in the topic. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.6">Lastly I will evaluate how well I was able to identify points in this report and discussion. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.6">I will also look at task processes as a group. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.6">In addition I will mention some questions rising at each stage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.6">
<s n="s1.6;p2.6">Our group has worked with the topic, <hi rend="italic">how do we understand speech?</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.6">. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.6">In order to answer the question, we have approached the topic with three points. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.6">They are speech perception from the biological view, comprehension of speech in a context and models of speech perception. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.6">In this topic I personally questioned whether we perceive sounds in the brain or whether we hear words with contextual meaning when we actually understand speech. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.6">We concluded that both approaches are possible ways to understand speech in our study. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.6">
<s n="s1.8;p3.6">In the topic I found it most interesting about the lack of invariance problem as I have never realised the fact before although the point is reasonably understandable. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.6">It also leads to a further question whether brain has any effects on understanding speech with lack of invariance problem. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.6">In addition my significant new learning was the fact we expect what we hear or we guess missing parts from the context when we could not accurately hear speech. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.6">It in fact proves how I found speech in English. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.6">For example in lectures I cannot catch all words lecturers speak nor understand some of the meaning. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.6">However I am able to follow the content overall. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.6">The fact was a surprise for me as it enabled me to realise how my brain is working on when I hear English speech. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.6">In addition from the reading I am interested in how our brains biologically have comprehended missing sounds with only meanings such as phoneme restoration effect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.6">
<s n="s1.5;p4.6">Our group was able to introduce some important terms and concepts such as comprehension of sounds and garden path effects. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.6">However since we had included too many points in the presentation we made it confusing and difficult for audiences to follow the context. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.6">Furthermore it made difficult for audiences to come up questions. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.6">Therefore in discussion I could not identify points very well. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.6">However in this report I have achieved to answer each question clearly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.6">
<s n="s1.4;p5.6">It was beneficial to work on the topic as a group since our topic was really complicated and I could not comprehend it fully by myself. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.6">We have achieved to understand better by helping each other. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.6">On the other hand it was challenging as each of us were given different sources approaching the topic with different ways. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.6">Therefore we were confused where to focus in the discussion from the broad sources. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.6">
<s n="s1.6;p6.6">Overall I believe the task process in group discussion was fairly successful since students' presentations had brought friendly atmosphere which enables other students to engage the discussion better. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.6">It also encouraged to examine the topic and to produce questions by themselves rather than simply listening to lectures. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.6">However some students had made a speech rather than having discussion. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.6">Therefore these sessions lacked the benefit of the group discussion. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.6">I believe it would be improved if we can concentrate a question arisen from the topic area and discuss it in the discussion. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.6">Since the detailed context will be covered in the lecture it would be much useful and interesting to concern a particular aspect on topics. </s>
