<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.4;p2.24">From the time Peter Mitchell proposed the chemiosmotic hypothesis in the 1960s, researchers have been speculating on how ATP synthesis could be coupled by a proton gradient. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.24">By 1977, experiments conducted by Berg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. demonstrated that bacterial flagellar rotation is powered by a proton gradient (Manson <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1977), and this was followed by researchers assaying for rotation in ATP synthase. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.24">After numerous experiments, it is now known that ATP synthase is the key enzyme involved in ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate, using the proton motive force. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.24">The enzyme is a membrane bound protein, and is found in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in plants and in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.24">
<s n="s1.5;p3.24">The overall molecular mass of the complex is 520kDa (Capaldi <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.24">1999) and it is though to be the world's smallest rotary engine. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.24">(Wang <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1998). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.24">It also has an extremely high mechanical efficiency, calculated by taking the ration of the average viscous dissipation per step to the free energy of hydrolysis, of almost 100%. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.24">Wang <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. explain that "this high efficiency is possible because the motor is not a heat engine, but is driven almost completely by elastic strain energy." </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.6;p4.24">ATP synthase is also often called ATPase, which is because it was discovered through the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.24">This is the reaction for which most experimental data has been obtained (Weber <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2000). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.24">The reason behind this because the synthesis of ATP is more difficult to study as a proton gradient is necessary. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.24">Hence much of the evidence behind the structure and mechanism of the F <hi rend="sub">1</hi>F <hi rend="sub">O</hi> type ATP synthase will be based on its catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.24">However, a novel experiment (Itoh <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2004) using electrical magnets to move the γ subunit via an attached magnetic bead resulted in the appearance of ATP in the medium. </s>

<head rend="underlined">THE F1 DOMAIN CONTAINS THREE CATALYTIC SITES</head>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.10;p8.24">X-ray crystallographic studies by John Walker <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p8.24">(Abrahams <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1994) revealed that F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> contains three catalytic sites, one on each β subunit. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.24">Addition of excess ATP lead to the binding of ATP in all three sites, with lower affinity binding at the second and third sites. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.24">Although the affinities for the substrates were lower for the other two sites, enzyme activity, however, increased. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.24">That is, in the words of Capaldi <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., the enzyme "displays a strong negative cooperativity of substrate binding and at the same time a strong positive cooperativity of enzymatic activity." </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.24">This unusual property was explained by a hypothesis proposed by Boyer, namely the "binding charge" or "alternating site" hypothesis. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.24">Essentially, Boyer suggested that each of the three catalytic sites are in different conformation at any one time. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.24">One is open and ready for ATP (or ADP+P <hi rend="sub">i</hi>) binding, the second is partly open and the third is closed around the bound nucleotide. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.24">Boyer proposed that ATP binding would result in the closure of the open site and cause a cooperative conformational change, inducing the other two sites to change - the closed site to partly open and the party open site to open completely. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p8.24">In this way, each site would alternate between three states as ATP hydrolysis progresses (or in the reverse direction if ATP synthesis is considered) </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.4;p9.24">This was an insightful proposal by Boyer, but the problem still remained on how these conformation changes could be propagated between the three catalytic sites and in what manner these events were coupled to proton translocation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.24">Again it was Boyer that suggested that both could occur by the rotation of one or more subunits in the F <hi rend="sub">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.24">It is now known that it is in fact the γ and ε subunits that provide the rotor and the <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunit ring rotates against <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> subunits during proton translocation. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p10.24">In contrast to the detailed structural model that has been established for the F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> domain of ATP synthase, much less is known about the F <hi rend="sub">O</hi> part. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.24">The reasons described by Stock <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. are that the <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunit shows no interpretable side chain density and in addition, the density could not be improved by modelling the subunits as polyalanine or by averaging. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.24">As a consequence, it has not been possible to build a clear atomic model of this portion of ATP synthase. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.24">
<s n="s1.7;p11.24">Nevertheless, the electron densities of the <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunits do show that they consist of two α helices linked by a loop (Stock <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1999) and it is thought that there are number of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunits forming a circular complex. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.24">However, the exact number of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunits is unclear, and the number may depend on species. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.24">In their 1999 review, Stock <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. explain that the number of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunits in the ring has an implication for the number of protons translocated by F <hi rend="sub">O</hi> for each ATP molecule synthesised. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.24">Therefore, the number of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunits of 9 or 12 was considered to require translocation of three or four protons per ATP synthesised to bring about a 120° rotation to the c ring. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.24">"A ring with 10 c subunits in it suggests that the H+/ATP ratio is probably nonintegral and that its value lie between three and four. </s>

<s n="s7.7;p11.24">(Stock <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1999) However, the number of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> subunits in the ring complex is still a disputed topic. </s>

<hi rend="underlined">Fig. 5 Enzymatic mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis and synthesis, as proposed by Weber <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>.</hi> Catalytic site conformations are: O, open (unoccupied); H, highest affinity for nucleotide; M, medium affinity; L, lowest affinity; L*, site with Pi binding pocket present. The central arrow denotes γ -subunit rotation.<hi rend="underlined">a. ATP hydrolysis</hi> : Binding of ATP to the empty site O (AB) brings about hydrolysis in the H site by catalytic site cooperativity (BC). Combined binding and hydrolysis of ATP occur with 90° rotation of γ , which is also associated with switch in conformations of the catalytic sites (`binding change'). Pi is released (CD) associated with 30° rotation of γ , followed by ADP release (DA) to regenerate the starting ground state.<hi rend="underlined">b. ATP synthesis</hi> : Proton-driven γ rotation generates L* from O (III) so that Pi binds. This allows discrimination so that ADP binds (IIIII) despite an unfavourable [ATP]/[ADP] ratio in the cell of ≥ 10/1. Next the binding change occurs (IIIIIIV) and ADP+Pi condense chemically at the (new) H site. Release of ATP involves transformation of an H site via L to O site (IIIIVI).

<s n="s1.4;p23.24">Weber <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. argue that evidence now supports this trisite mechanism because molecules with two sites filled show negligible activity and writing a bisite mechanism poses problems. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.24">"A corollary is that only a molecule with all three sites filled can rotate. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.24">This emphasises a major point, that the F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> functions obligatorily as a three-cylinder engine." </s>

<s n="s1.4;p24.24">After decades of research on ATP synthase, a clearer picture of its structure has been developed and with it the understanding of its mechanism has matured. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p24.24">There is also a need for a more detailed structures of this part, as the lack of high resolution structure of subunit <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">a-c</hi> interface impedes the progress to finding the exact access channels which are needed to allow protons to move from the membrane surface to the specific amino acid residues. </s>

<quote lang="English">"...the ATP synthase field has expanded into "mechanoenzymology", encompassing not only enzymology and membrane transport, but also engineering and nanotechnology.
