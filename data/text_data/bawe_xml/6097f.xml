<item>Karl Popper (1902 - 1994): Austrian/English philosopher.</item>

<s n="s1.4;p7.46">Aristotle made important contributions by systematising deductive logic. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.46">He believed that the conclusion should follow from the premises, which is the requirement of deductive validity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.46">According to Aristotle, if you have a major universal premise and a minor specific premise, it is possible to come up with a conclusion. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p8.46">It is the epistemological theory that genuine information about the world must be acquired by '<hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi>' means, so that nothing can be thought without first being sensed. </s>

<p n="p9.46">
<s n="s1.8;p9.46">Enter Francis Bacon. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.46">Bacon's major contribution to philosophy was his application of induction, i.e. the approach used by modern science, which is an empiricist approach. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.46">At the time, much of philosophy was deeply rooted in pure faith, being promoted by the church. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.46">Bacon believed that scientific knowledge could not be unearthed by traditional deductive logic, but what was really needed for the comprehension and control of nature was an inductive procedure. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.46">This procedure, however, differed from the original 'classic' induction of Aristotle. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.46">The classical method of induction consists of making generalisations from particular observations, and then working backward via deduction to arrive at individual proposals. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.46">For example, one might come to a conclusion from a certain number of observations that all new cars are shiny in appearance. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.46">Due to this piece of inductive inference, one may then be permitted (because the truth would be logically guaranteed in the premises) to deduce from this generalisation to transitional axioms, such as 'all new Nissans are shiny' or 'all new Volkswagens are shiny'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.46">
<s n="s1.3;p10.46">Looking critically at this approach one can see that a problem arises if the original generalisation turns out to be untrue, because then the intermediate axioms may also transpire to be untrue. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.46">Bacon therefore revised the method of induction so that one progresses from each individual axiom to the next, thoroughly investigating every single one through experiment and observation to a confirmation, in order that the final, most general axioms are the effective conclusion. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.46">Hence if you were to modify the 'new shiny car' inductive procedure so that it represented the Baconian method, the starting point would be to fully examine all new Nissans, Volkswagens etc, thus acquiring as much information as possible and ultimately a greater truth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.46">
<s n="s1.6;p11.46">Now, this method appears to involve a great, prolonged effort, but according to Bacon, this procedure, in time gives a much more sound catalogue of knowledge, as opposed to an unstable formation, that is flawed as soon as an opposing instance crops up. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.46">But is Bacon's improved method of induction really the way to go? </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.46">It is quite obvious to see that the Baconian procedure doesn't necessarily lead to any general conclusions, and especially not to any scientific principles, that may be taken to be universally true. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.46">Furthermore, at what point does the explorer decide to stop observing and begin to construct the generalisations? </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.46">How many observations are necessary - ten, one hundred, or even one thousand? </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.46">The point to be made here is that unless the investigator goes right back to the beginning of time, to observe every single instance that has occurred, it is simply not acceptable to make any generalisations and take them to be true.<ref target="BAWE_6097f-ftnote.003"/> </s>
