<p n="p1.31">
<s n="s1.4;p1.31">Environmental policy has come to the forefront of European Union (EU) politics over the last few decades and now affects the majority of policy areas. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.31">As a result of this the EU has had to keep the environment as a high priority and there have been a number of directives and regulations directly relating to improving the current situation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.31">With regards to global environmental protection it is necessary to analyse the Union's role in three key ways; its influence as a global initiator of legislation, its standing as a role model and its success as an implementer. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.31">The EU's success as an international actor relies heavily on all three of these aspects in evaluating to what extent the EU has contributed to globally helping the environment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.31">
<s n="s1.3;p2.31">Regrettably for the environment the EU seems to have achieved limited success particularly in international negotiations and in the implementation of its legislation across its twenty five member states. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.31">Despite the progress that has been made in some areas of Europe in recent years, the Union's unique institutional set up has made it difficult for it to participate fully in international negotiations and thus influence the major polluters, namely America and, more recently, China. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.31">Even more of a challenge has been attempting to implement laws once they are finally passed or to be in a position to punish those who are failing to do so, problems which have become especially acute in light of the recent Eastern enlargement. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.31">
<s n="s1.5;p3.31">Firstly though, it is important to clarify what it is that is expected of an international actor such as the EU particularly in terms of environmental policy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.31">The EU enjoys the privileged position of representing a large group of Western countries, some of whom enjoy extreme riches and wealth, and therefore it should be pushing hard to dramatically improve the state of the environment. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.31">As a continent Europe is industrialized sufficiently and possesses both the money and technology to be pro active in bringing about such a change and be in a position to influence others to do the same. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.31">If the EU is to be a role model for other regional organizations in promoting a better way of life then it is essential that they are being seen to be improving the health of their citizens by helping the environment. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.31">With these aims in mind it is essential that all EU institutions are involved in the process, for there to be a fair representation of environmental focus groups and actors, and for citizens to be educated about the benefits of environmentally friendly schemes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.31">
<s n="s1.4;p4.31">To an extent the EU has succeeded in completing some of the above aims and it has enjoyed some success in participating in important international talks. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.31">The reason that the EU has even been able to participate is due to the Single European Act introduced in December 1985 which gave the Union a legal basis for negotiation in Article 130r(5), which stated that "within their respective spheres of competence, the Community and the Member States shall co-operate with third countries and the relevant international organizations." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244m-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.4;p4.31">The Maastricht Treaty followed on from this maintaining that "Community policy on the environment should contribute to promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244m-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s4.4;p4.31">Even as early as 1973 at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the major global treat on nature protection, the EC enacted "a regulation implementing the Treaty (EEC/3626/82) which protected more than 250 species of fauna and flora more stringently than did the CITES Convention itself." <ref target="BAWE_0244m-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.31">Furthermore, in relation to both the Climate and the Biodiversity conventions in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the EU has been said to have "performed a leadership role" as well as that of a mediator on the Rio Declaration on Environment, Development and Forest principles.<ref target="BAWE_0244m-ftnote.004"/> The EU's leadership capacity can also be seen at the Kyoto talks in 1997 where the EU "had the most ambitious negotiating target for Kyoto - namely, a 15 per cent cut in the three greenhouse gases: CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, CH <hi rend="sub">4</hi>, and N <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244m-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s2.3;p5.31">Considering their often needs to be lengthy internal negotiations between member states before an agreement can be made on the EU's position it has done well to have any sort of influence at the major environment conventions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.31">It is especially impressive in light of the fact that the EU may still find itself up against a member state in talks if matters fall under both Member State and Community jurisdiction and a system of dual representation is used where by the Union is represented by both the Commission and the Member State holding the Presidency of the Council. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p6.31">Furthermore the EU is the only international organization ever to have been given the privilege of being able to participate fully in a United Nations Conference when in 1992 they were able to take part in the deliberations at the Conference on Environment and Development. </s>
