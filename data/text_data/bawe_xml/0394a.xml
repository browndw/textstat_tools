<s n="s1.6;p1.40">Nowadays, teenage smoking is a common issue for most countries worldwide which draws upon a lot of concern. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.40">As tobacco use has been identified as a major preventable cause of premature death and illness. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.40">Each year about 440,000 people die in the United States from illnesses related to cigarette smoking and a great further number of deaths are attributable to second hand smoke<ref target="BAWE_0394a-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.40">Smoking initiation usually occurs during adolescence, while the vast majority of smoking related deaths occur in middle aged and elderly people. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.40">Therefore prevention of smoking initiation among adolescents is a powerful strategy for keeping away much of the illness associated with tobacco use. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.40">To target for a right intervention control, it is important to understand primarily of the associated risk/protective factors in terms of influencing teenager's choice of smoking uptake towards to which also form the basis of this empirical research. Results showed that peer influence determines the strongest relationship for an adolescent to become a smoker. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p2.40">Research on the factors associated with youth smoking has been based on the following areas: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p3.40">
<s n="s1.7;p3.40">1) Socio demographics (individual's gender, age, races, income and accessibility of tobaccos): Historically, prevalence of smoking was higher for male than female (Surgeon General 1994). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.40">However recent trends show there's an equal rate between the two genders as female smoking prevalence is increasing. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.40">Reasons probably include factors of increasing weight concern among females (French, 1994). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.40">Despite of gender indifference, Winkleby MA 1993 identifies high school students are more susceptible to smoking behavior than middle school students as it is usually associated with the critical age in a youth's development. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.40">It supported the statistics in USA that higher smoking rate among teenagers at/ above14 than teenagers than below this age and higher smoking prevalence was found among people of American Indian origin.<ref target="BAWE_0394a-ftnote.002"/> Another variable has been found to correlate with adolescent smoking is related to their income, young people with more spending money showed higher levels of smokin (W.Schlenger, 2003). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.40">Towards easy accessibility of tobacco products will also increase the onset of smoking. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.40">(Difranza JR, 1996). </s>

</p>
</note>
<p rend="ordered" n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.4;p4.40">2) Environmental factors (peer influence, living people influence and parental attitude): Adolescents with close friends smoking may be more susceptible to smoking due to the direct pressure among their friends and a desire for approval among their social group (Kimberly, 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.40">Having living members smoking at home may also increase individual risk (Shelli, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.40">Further study has investigated a number of related factors associated with parental attitudes showing that strongly parental disapproval of smoking was inversely correlated with adolescent smoking. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.40">(Biglan A, 1995) </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p5.40">
<s n="s1.2;p5.40">3) Behavioral variables (academic performance and aspirations): Smoking status has been found to be consistently related to school performance, educational aspirations and commitment to school. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.40">Students who committed to schooling, doing well in academics are less likely to smoke than those who do not (Tyas S, Pederson L 1998) </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p6.40">
<s n="s1.2;p6.40">4) Community factors (anti tobacco advertising/ discussion of dangers of tobacco use among in school): A research study done by Sherry Emery in 1999 shows that anti tobacco adverts on television which identifies consequences of tobacco use are associated with more favorable anti smoking attitudes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.40">Also according to B S Flynn 1992, discussions of dangers of tobacco use in school can have a positive effect on increasing teenager resistance towards smoking behavior </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.6;p7.40">Therefore after identifying the associated risk/protective factors towards affecting a teenage smoking uptake status, in the following section I will carry out an empirical regression analysis on investigating the significance of these explanatory factors. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.40">The data I've selected to use will be based on National Youth Tobacco Survey in USA 2004 conducted by the Cancer diseases centre since CDC is one of the 13 major operating centre of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which is globally recognized for conducting health research and investigations. The survey consists of 27933 observations; the sample target is on US middle school (grade 6-8) and high school (grade 9-12) students who are basically from 4 ethnicity regions (white, Hispanic, Asian, African American). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.40">The reason why I have chosen to pick for year 2004 dataset to estimate as the research in that year was conducted in a larger sampling set and it only consisted of small amount of missing datas compared to some other datas of recent years. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.40">However it is not without limitation since this questionnaire was only available in English. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.40">So comprehension maybe limited to some ethical participants whose first language is not English. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.40">This may one of the main potential bias in the data result. </s>

<p n="p8.40">
<s n="s1.6;p8.40">In this section, the dependant variable we are going to test is the likelihood of the adolescent whether or not he/she is going be a smoker. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.40">Explanatory variables include examining into how factors such as adolescent's gender, age, ethnicity, friends influence, parental attitude, living people influence, their interest in schooling, amount of income earned, effect of anti smoking advertisement and school discussion of danger of tobacco use will independently correlated with the dependant variable. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.40">The choice of these explanatory variables will allow us to compare the effect of how biological/genetics factors, social environment, individual characteristics, commodity price, control intervention each can increase or decrease the probability for a adolescent to take up smoking. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.40">The test of dependent variables will also be binary in nature. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.40">Therefore before turning to estimate the regression, it is necessary to generalize all the dependant and independent variables correctly into dummies variables from the raw dataset.<ref target="BAWE_0394a-ftnote.003"/> Since both the dependent and independent variables are dummy variables, therefore OLS is not the best estimation methodology for a non linear regression. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.40">A better approach to estimate this regression is to run the binary choice and taking the probit regression approach. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p40.40">From the result found, the target group should be mostly for high school than middle school students. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p40.40">Other than age, two other factors such as gender and races the teenage belong to are not significant towards to have a relationship with the probability of the teenager's smoking uptake. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p40.40">The former confound to what recent literatures have found whilst the latter is hard to conclude as statistics shown that American Indian have higher smoking rate than other races. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p40.40">Therefore we may suspect that there are factors other than genetics that affected this social group to associate with a higher smoking rate or it maybe associated with data errors that actually occurred to bias the result. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p40.40">Therefore improvement over the model towards future work should include to test for time series regression to check for the persistence significance/insignificance of the explanatory variables Since given limited amount of time for data collection, some of the variables have not been included, such as how the accessibility of tobacco correlates with individual smoking uptake, it is greatly recommended to be added into future research. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p40.40">It can be further enhanced if the reciprocal relationships between those significant risk/protective factors can be explored, all of which have important implications for policy researchers in developing for more effective youth tobacco intervention programmes in the future and tailoring to those who are most vulnerable to the risk. </s>
