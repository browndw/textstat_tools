This is assumeing that indeirect realist aprouch to perception, that what we experience is something private in our own minds an only caused by the outside world. I full accept that if a direct realist aprouch is takenI am assumeing here an indirect realist aprouch to the idea of sense perception. I fully acknoladge that there is a strong case in - HOLD ON! ASK GLORIA AGAIN, SURELY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER A DIRECT OR INDIRECT REALISEM IS ASSUMED; PRIVATE INTROSPECTION IS JUST THAT, PRIVATE)Things I need to find out so far*	Whether my argument for individual inteliablity ? meeningull works*	A quote from Descartes saying that the mind is a substance1.	Descartes belives that the body and the soul are two distinct things2.	Distinct things have unique properts and attributes3.	Descartes belives that the soul has certain attributes: It exists. It lasts over time. It is non corporal. It is Indivisible. There is no way to come to know it via sense data (Quote: the rejecition of fire or mist idea of mind).4.	For something to be tenable it must be meaningful5.	One of the conditions for an existing thing (not a concept) being meaningful is that it is indivdualy intelligible6.	 Individuality in existing things (not consepts, like numbers) can only be via it's special/temporal loctation, and this can only be arrived at via sense perception/data(the private langage argument only works against sense data which is private, not against the objects/source of sense perception which direct realists would claim is shared) (conditions for indivituation something: (applies only for indirect realist)7.	Sense data from introspection must be discounted due to the private language argument, unless a second party is always present, even in our thoughts (God)8.	God's existence cannot be assumed9.	Descartes' 'mind' cannot be arrived at via acceptable sense data, so it cannot be individuated.10.	Since it cannot be individuated it cannot be meaningful11.	Since Descartes' 'mind' cannot be said to be meaningful his argument is untenable.Scrap(MAKE CLEAR distinction between the object itself and the concept of it, between the mind and the concept of mind. Mentaion qualitative/quantative distionationality. We can only tell qunatavie distionction. Change boundery comment)	 Now usually we can distinquish between objects with our sense - two books look different, qualitative difference. How about if they identical? We could see they occupy different space and so must occupy different spacio/temporal lines and must be two distinct objects. But what can we do without senses...Individual intellagliablity nessessary condiotin for meeningfullness*	We cannot know what something is unless we know what a single instance of that things is. If we couldn't know this we wouldn't know where that thing stopped and another began. If we didn't know that we couldn't know where that thing's 'boarders' or 'bounderys' are, we couldn't tell it apart from the things surrounding it. If we can't know what a single instance of something is then we would not be able to tell where that thing started or stopped, as such we could not know if it was there or not. If something by it's principle cannot be known to be there or not then it is meaningless; it points to nothing and implys nothing*	If we want to use words like 'the' Private languadge argument applied to introspective definitions.*	Private introspection does not satisfy one of the nessesarty conditions of meaning.*	The results of private introspection can be known only to you.*	For a concept to be meeningfull is must have correctness condtions - you must know when you have experienced what you call the feeling of I and when you haven't. there must be some constraint to when I can say I have felt this feeling.*	Since meening is normative, for us to be able to say 'I have the feeling of this being one mind and not ten' we have to have something to calibrate this sentence against, something which will tell us whether we were right or wrong to say what we said.*	But since it is totally private then my use of that sentence can't be calibrated aginast anyone else.*	We would be radically free in what we were pointing to when we said 'I have a feeling of this being one mind and not ten'. You cannot impress onto yourself a binding connection to avoid radical freedom because there is no guarantee or check that I use it correctly in the future, that I remember the connection I tried to impress on myself between the feeling and the sentence. All we would know is that it seems like it is the same feeling. But if seems right and is right are the same then we are radically free.*	For the concept of mind to be meeningfull then it must be knowable in the public arena, and that does not happen with the private ostensive proof given by pointing inside and saying 'this is how I know there is only one of me in here'*	Link to God</note>

<s n="s1.6;p4.12">If the Cartesian position is to be tenable then Descartes' concept of the mind must be meaningful. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.12">Without this meaning the Cartesian has very little position left at all. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.12">If there is no way to talk about the mind meaningfully then why does the Cartesian say anything at all? </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.12">There may very well exist things in this universe that as humans we simply do not possess the ability to think or talk about in any way, and our inability to talk about them will have no existential effect on them at all. </s>

<s n="s6.6;p4.12">Therefore whether or not the mind exists as a separate entity is somewhat besides the point; if the Cartesian can't talk about it his position it would be untenable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.5;p5.12">Perhaps first reactions would be that the concept of the mind must be meaningful, for we have just given a description of the mind and have experienced no problems in understanding the meaning of each attribute. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.12">Looking deeper however, we must ask whether the attributes make sense together and whether to make those attributes work more attributes would be necessary. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.12">If the attributes already assigned do not work together the Cartesian will be forced to drop at least one of the offending properties (like in the Reductio rule in formal logic). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.12">This would change his position radically. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p6.12">Individual intelligibility is a necessary condition for a concept being meaningful because we cannot know what something is unless we know what a single instance of that thing is, or in Strawson's words: "We have no idea what a <hi rend="italic">so-and-so</hi> is unless we have some idea what <hi rend="bold italic">a</hi> so-and-so is"<ref target="BAWE_0026b-ftnote.002"/>. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p6.12">If you didn't know that a single elephant had four legs and one trunk then I would be able to show you some large grey lumps with 7 legs, 4 trunks and 20 big ears and you would call these elephants. </s>

<s n="s9.9;p6.12">Without a measure of individual innumerability, of what a single instance is like, we would not be able to tell one elephant from two, and would not be able to tell an elephant from a large grey mass with trunks and big ears. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p8.12">What we usually say makes two objects distinct, even if they were identical down to the minute detail, is that they travel two different spacio-temporal lines. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p9.12">We would therefore never be able to tell whether there were one or two minds in the bodies we see before us. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.12">Taken step further we could not tell if there even was a mind in the body we see before us, and that includes the body we see in the mirror. </s>

<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.4;p10.12">If we could not, even in theory, ever tell whether there is one or more such things with distinct spacio-temporal lines, then we would never be able to tell whether there is one object present or two, or for that matter a million or zero. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.12">If we cannot, even in theory, say anything at all about the number of such objects, even as basic a statement as whether there is or is not such an object present, then the concept becomes meaningless. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.12">If something, by its very nature, cannot be known to exist in any way, then to talk about that concept is to talk about nothing; saying there may or may not be a chair in front of me is not actually saying anything at all. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p11.12">This point applies just as well to the claim that the mind exists through time. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.12">To keep this central property of the mind, we must be able to have some criteria for saying whether the mind exists or not. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.12">Otherwise, we could not be able to say that the mind is still existing now, or that it didn't exist a thousand years ago. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.12">To know what it is for something to continue existing one must have conditions by which to tell that the thing in question has or has not existed through a set period of time. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.12">Without a standard of individual innumerability however, we could not tell if the thing in question has just popped in and out of existence whenever we paid attention to it. </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.12">
<s n="s1.6;p12.12">Having looked at the properties originally assigned to the mind, I have come to the conclusion that it does in fact need other things attributed to it for it to remain a meaningful consent. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.12">Remembering that the Cartesian mind is to be considered as a thing "which is real and which truly exists"<ref target="BAWE_0026b-ftnote.004"/>, not just a concept or a place holder, we must conclude that for the Cartesian concept of mind to be meaningful the mind must be an individually intelligible thing. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.12">The Cartesian clearly wants his concept of mind to be meaningful, and so a method of enumerating distinct minds from one another must be devised. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.12">The Cartesian then must be committed to the thesis that it must be possible to make independently intelligible what is meant by identity and difference of human consciousness. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.12">Otherwise, he would be committed to a thesis which one of the primary postulates is a meaningless concept. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.12">However, whether it is actually possible to assign individual innumerability to a non corporeal thing and still call it a substance is not within the realms of this essay. </s>
