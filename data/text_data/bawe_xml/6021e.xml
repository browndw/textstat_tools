<s n="s1.1;p25.26">There is much debate over the causes of obesity in the UK today, with evidence to suggest psychological, physiological, genetic, hormonal, drug-related and environmental links which together highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach in targeting the problem. </s>

<p n="p26.26">
<s n="s1.1;p26.26">In summary, the introduction of a VAT on foods high in saturated fats is not likely to impact on consumer's food choices and diet sufficiently to reduce obesity levels and their costs to the economy due to the UK's relatively inelastic demand for fatty foods and the limitations of the policy with regard to the wider causes of the epidemic. </s>
