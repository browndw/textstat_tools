<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s3.3;p10.10">In atomic absorption spectroscopy, the most commonly used fuel/ oxidant system is air-acetylene and over 30 elements can usefully be measured using this combination of gases, and this temperature of this flame is of the order of 2300 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C which is great higher than flame photometry (King, 1978), so the atomic absorption methods can excited the transition metals due to the wavelength from an extend source and can provide higher energy. </s>
