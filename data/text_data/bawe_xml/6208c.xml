<s n="s2.3;p2.54">The colligative properties of electrolyte solutions are more complicated than those of non-electrolytes because the solute dissociates into free ions and because the ions in the solution are then subject to strong interactions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.54">However colligative properties can be used to give a rough indication of the number of particles present in a solution, and hence the extent of dissociation of an electrolyte in solution. </s>

<p n="p9.54">
<s n="s1.3;p9.54">Strictly colligative properties depend on the molality (moles of solute per kg of solvent) rather than the concentration or molarity (moles of solute per dm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> of solution), but the difference between the two scales is small for aqueous solutions and was neglected in the experiment. </s>
