<s n="s4.5;p2.10">The processing of making yogurt can be divided into the follow steps:1) preparation of mix(standardization, fortification with skim milk power); 2)homogenization; 3)heat treatment; 4)cool to incubation; 5)inoculation with starter; 6)pack in retail container; 7)incubate; 8)cool. </s>

<s n="s3.12;p6.10">The first bacteriological study of yogurt was in 1905. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p6.10">Until 1974, Bergey, D.H gave the classification of microbiology in yogurt in two separate families, the Streptococcaceae and the Lactobacillaceae. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p6.10">With the development of research, the growth association between the two organisms (S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus) of yogurt starter culture is termed a symbiosis. </s>

<s n="s10.12;p6.10">The discussion about the symbol lasts many years. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p6.10">Bautista, Dahiya and Speck (1966) also investigated a theory about this phenomenon. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p6.10">They hold the point that S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus by releasing gliding and histidine in to the growth medium and the histidine played a more important role than valine. </s>

<p n="p7.10">
<s n="s1.4;p7.10">The discussion did not stop, with the more research scientists did, the more theories about the symbiosis had been found. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p7.10">According to Bottazzi with his colleagues (1971) found that the presence of formic acid which was considered as a stimulatory in milk can improve the ratio of rods to cocci at concentrations between 30 and 50 γ/ ml. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p8.10">In 1977 Tamime, A.Y found the rate of acid development of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus increase with increase in incubation temperature up to the maxima of 40° and 45° respectively. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.10">And he recommended that , in order to maintain and / or achieve a ratio of 1:1 between S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus, the organisms should be propagated to together at 42° using a 2% inoculation rate. </s>
