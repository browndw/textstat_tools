<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.17">
<s n="s1.6;p1.17">There are lots of concerns over the use of genetically modified organisms in the production of food. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.17">This topic is incredibly controversial and appears very frequently in the news. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.17">Naturally, consumers are wary about new technologies as no one can predict the long term effects of genetically modified food, even with detailed scientific research and trials. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.17">Most consumers rely on the media to make their judgment on genetically modified food. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.17">These sources do provide information but some tend to be bias and simplified. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.17">This may mean consumers lose the right to an informed decision due to the lack of information available to them. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.2;p2.17">The consumer concerns will be considered to see if they are justified but also the benefits that genetically modified food may hold for the world will be examined. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.17">Also the background of genetically modified organisms and how they are created will be explored. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.4;p3.17">Genetically modified is a term used to describe the insertion, enhancement or deletion of a particular characteristics of an organism. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.17">This is done by altering genes in the DNA of a specific organism. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.17">The insertion of specific genes may either be from a species very closely related to itself or from a distant species. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.17">This is because all genes come from DNA and all DNA has the same basic structure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.6;p4.17">Genetic modification involves removing a desired gene from one organism and joining the gene onto a plasmid. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.17">The plasmid and desired gene together are known as recombinant DNA. The recombinant DNA is then inserted into a bacterium, in which reproduction occurs. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.17">This process produces more bacterium with copies of recombinant DNA. The bacterium, with the copies of recombinant DNA then infects the organism that requires the specific characteristic. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.17">Before genetic modification, desired traits were achieved through farmers by selective breeding. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.17">However this method is very time consuming and it is not accurate unlike genetic modification. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.17">Genetic modification is more specific and can create the exact characteristic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.3;p5.17">There are many consumer concerns about the use of genetically modified food. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.17">These concerns can be categorised into environmental hazards, health risks and economic concerns. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.17">All these categories involve whether genetically modified food is safe and will be examined closely. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.6;p6.17">Environmental hazards of genetic engineering include inadvertent gene transfer to non target species. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.17">For example, crops that have been engineered to be herbicide tolerant might crossbreed with weeds creating 'super weeds', that would be herbicide tolerant. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.17">This is a very justified concern because if 'super weeds' were to be introduced into the environment it may also affect the growth of other crops that are essential food for humans. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.17">There is also concern that genetically modified crops could reduce the effectiveness of pesticides. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.17">Many people worry that insects will become resistant to crops that have been genetically modified to produce their own pesticides, therefore reducing the quantity of food. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.17">Genetic modification may also lead to undesirable consequences such as reducing the biodiversity of traditional crops. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.17">
<s n="s1.11;p7.17">The health risks involved with genetically modified food include the tendency to promote allergic reactions and the unknown effects on health. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.17">As allergies increase in society it is important to minimise the risk of allergic reactions to genetically modified food. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.17">This can be done by not transferring genes from species where there is a known allergic reaction such as peanuts but genetic modification may also introduce new allergies into society. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.17">Extensive testing of genetically modified food may be required to avoid the possibility of harm to consumers with food allergies. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.17">As the effects on human health have only been researched over a small time scale, the long term risk to human health is unknown. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.17">Introducing new genes into food may have a negative effect on human health that may not be noticeable for years. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.17">Another concern relates to the vectors used for transforming plant cells. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.17">These contain genes for antibiotic resistance. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.17">These antibiotic resistant genes enter the transformed plant with the desired gene. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.17">The antibiotic resistant gene may be passed into the E.coli bacteria in the gut, making it resistant to some types of antibiotics. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.17">This concern is antibiotics are very commonly used in medical treatments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.17">
<s n="s1.6;p8.17">The consumer concern over the economics of genetically modified food is justified with two strong arguments. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.17">One is the cost marketing the genetically modified food. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.17">It is an expensive process and consumers worry that biotech companies just want to make a profit and are not interested in consumer welfare. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.17">The other concern involves the patents on the genetically modified crops. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.17">The concern is that the developing countries farmers will not be able to afford the seeds for the genetically modified crop. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.17">This is a big problem because one of the benefits of genetically modified food is it will ensure that there is enough food for the world's population, especially in the developing countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.17">
<s n="s1.5;p9.17">Some of the consumer concerns are justified but genetically modified food may hold many benefits. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.17">The main advantage is ensuring an adequate food supply. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.17">The world's population is increasing and one of the ways to meet the demand is through the genetic manipulation of plants. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.17">There are many ways that genetic modification can increase the amount of food produced and make crops more useful. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.17">These include, enabling plants to become cold or drought resistant, improving resistance to pests, improving storage time and enhancing the production of vitamins. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.17">
<s n="s1.3;p10.17">Cold and drought resistant plants are important because when there are extreme climate changes crops can fail. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.17">Unexpected cold weather can destroy seedlings. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.17">If the crop is genetically modified using an antifreeze gene the seedlings will not die, therefore ensuring a food supply. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.17">
<s n="s1.4;p11.17">As insect pests reduce the world's crop population by over 13% per year it is important to combat pests. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.17">This can be done by the use of chemicals. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.17">However this method causes environmental problems as the run off of agricultural wastes from excessive pesticides can contaminate the water supply and the pesticides could be damaging to consumers health. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.17">By genetic modification of pest resistant plants, less pesticides need to be used on plants. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.17">
<s n="s1.4;p12.17">An example of a pest resistant plant is maize as it contains a gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt gene). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.17">It is the protein that is produced by the Bt gene that is toxic to some insect pests. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.17">The insect resistant genetically modified maize is rarely sprayed with pesticides because the Bt gene provides continuous protection to the plant because of the toxic protein that is being produced. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.17">Another consumer advantage of the genetically modified maize is that the insecticide is confined just to the maize so there is less damage to the surrounding environment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.17">
<s n="s1.4;p13.17">Improving storage time is important, so consumers get a product that keeps longer and fewer crops are wasted. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.17">Genetic modification for storage is shown in the FlavrSavr tomato. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.17">Usually when tomatoes ripen a gene is triggered and a chemical is released that causes the fruit to soften and then rot. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.17">Scientists have modified that gene in the tomato by switching it off, so the tomato softens slowly and this prolongs shelf life. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.17">
<s n="s1.3;p14.17">In developing countries malnutrition is common because people are unable to have a varied diet. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.17">Genetically modifying a crop like rice, so it contains added vitamins and minerals, not usually found in rice could be beneficial. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.17">It may help combat some of the vitamin deficiency and improve the health of people. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.17">
<s n="s1.9;p15.17">In conclusion, some consumer concerns are justified however genetically modified food does also have some benefits. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p15.17">The main justified concern is the unknown effect on human health. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p15.17">The short and long term effects of genetically modified food need to be researched further and this will allow consumers to make a more informed decision about genetically modified food. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p15.17">At present some consumer concerns are due to lack of information about genetically modified organisms and don't understand all the implications involved with genetically modified food. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p15.17">The government understands consumer concerns and takes the human right of adequate food supply and has tried to alleviate some of the their concerns with labelling laws and policies. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p15.17">The policies state that all genetically modified foods exported must be labelled. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p15.17">This allows consumers to have a choice whether they take the risk and buy genetically modified product or not. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p15.17">However consumers must also realise the potential of genetically modified food in the future. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p15.17">It is a way of ensuring a food supply for the world, with benefits such as pest resistant crops and increase nutritional value of crops. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.17">
<s n="s1.3;p16.17">This powerful technology has got to be applied with caution if it is going to be implemented successfully on a world scale. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.17">Genetic modification may also need to be refined slightly to improve safety and reassure consumers. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.17">However scientists must always remember that once food has been genetically altered there is no way of getting back to </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.17">
<s n="s1.1;p17.17">the food original makeup. </s>
