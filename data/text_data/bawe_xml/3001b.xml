<s n="s1.1;p1.10">In a collection of poems entitled <hi rend="italic">Why Brownlee Left (1980),</hi> Irish poet Paul Muldoon included the sonnet 'October 1950,'in which he writes about his own conception: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">

<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.4;p2.10">This deliberation over subjectivity, technology and place is not new to contemporary literature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.10">Victorian society was fractured by social, political and scientific upheavals, through the proliferation of scientific material, notably Charles Darwin's <hi rend="italic">The Origin of the Species (1859),</hi> which prompted religious doubt, the periodic economic depression inflicted by the Corn Laws passed in 1815 and the passing of the Reform Act in 1832, allowing the industrial middle class to vote. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.10">These rapid changes created instabilities that threatened an individual's sense of their social identity and it seems this dilemma of the self has extended into the zeitgeist of contemporary literature, as Steven Connor highlights "the novel is [still] central to modern societies, in that it dramatises the process of integrating self-formation." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s4.4;p2.10">In response to this, I will examine how social identity is constructed through the politics of space and place in Charles Dickens <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations (1861),</hi> Alan Warner's <hi rend="italic">Morvern Callar (1995)</hi> and Jeanette Winterson's <hi rend="italic">The Powerbook (2001.)</hi> </s>

<p n="p3.10">
<s n="s1.28;p3.10">In his <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations (1861)</hi> Charles Dickens writes the <hi rend="italic">bildungsroman</hi> of the protagonist Pip. </s>
<s n="s2.28;p3.10">It is a novel of growth<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.002"/>* depicting the boys search for identity and exploring the Renaissance trope of self-fashioning. </s>
<s n="s3.28;p3.10">The novel opens to reveal Pip in the marshes among the gravestones of his deceased parents and brothers. </s>
<s n="s4.28;p3.10">Against the backdrop of the wild, unpopulated and unclaimed Kent marshes, he forges his own identity when he states 'I called myself Pip." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s5.28;p3.10">By establishing Pip and the other young adults in the novel as orphans, Dickens allowed his readers, who had been bereft of old traditions, to commiserate with this lost identity. </s>
<s n="s6.28;p3.10">The orphan was equated with an 'unauthored' identity that goes in search of authority in an attempt to 'authorize the plot of his ensuing life." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s7.28;p3.10">Linked to this ideal of authority is the father figure. </s>
<s n="s8.28;p3.10">Psychoanalyst Anny Sadrin believes Pip is " a Telemachus figure: a male orphan who has to redeem his father's death and return to his origins. </s>
<s n="s9.28;p3.10">So the 'true' ending of <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations</hi> is Pip's return to the parental graves, and his story is about his mistakes in projecting his paternal ideal." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s10.28;p3.10">His attempts to construct his personality are prompted through a Lacanian lack of his parent's identity when he gleans their character traits from the 'shape of the letters'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.006"/> on their tombstones. </s>
<s n="s11.28;p3.10">Interestingly, I am reminded of Saussurian signifying systems when Pip relates; 'from the character and turn of the inscription, '<hi rend="italic">Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,</hi>' I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s12.28;p3.10">Accordingly, his sense of separateness and his 'first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.008"/> are established on his meeting with, would-be father, Magwitch, who suddenly appears from behind his father's grave. </s>
<s n="s13.28;p3.10">His social identity dilemma then arises from misinterpreting paternal figures like Miss Havisham and Wemmick and being confused by characters assuming the role of stepfather; like Mr Pumblechook. </s>
<s n="s14.28;p3.10">Interestingly, Charles Dickens own relationship with his father was fraught with instability and disappointment. </s>
<s n="s15.28;p3.10">His father repeatedly led the family into debt, eventually ending in his imprisonment in Marshalsea prison, with Dickens being forced to work in a blacking warehouse. </s>
<s n="s16.28;p3.10">These early experiences traumatised the young Dickens and propelled his literary ambitions. </s>
<s n="s17.28;p3.10">The parallels between Dickens own life and the <hi rend="italic">bildungsroman</hi> of Pip in <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations</hi> are striking in their similarity. </s>
<s n="s18.28;p3.10">It is entirely possible that Magwitch is the embellished literary form of Dickens father, for it is Magwitch who propels Pip towards the realisation of his great expectations and social identity. </s>
<s n="s19.28;p3.10">Interestingly, in the Twentieth Century Fox production of <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations (1997)</hi> directed by Alfonso Cuaron, the young Pip encounters Magwitch not by the gravestones, but when examining his reflection in the shallow waters of the marshes he notices the convict hiding underneath, as if revealing an older mirror image of himself. </s>
<s n="s20.28;p3.10">Linked to this is the notion of naming. </s>
<s n="s21.28;p3.10">The parent names a child and in this action forms the fundamental basis of the child's subjectivity. </s>
<s n="s22.28;p3.10">Christopher Morris concurs that "Pip's preoccupations with names...all point to Pip's own basic lack of an autonomous self." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s23.28;p3.10">On the marshes Pip is free to let his social identity evolve naturally. </s>
<s n="s24.28;p3.10">However, when placed in Sattis House and London, other social identities are forced upon him. </s>
<s n="s25.28;p3.10">Estella feeds him ' as if I were a dog in disgrace'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.010"/> Interestingly, on meeting Pip in the marshes Magwitch demands him to 'give us your name'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.011"/> as if it were a physical handle that can be taken off and on like a piece of clothing. </s>
<s n="s26.28;p3.10">Despite Magwitch's instructions as Pip's benefactor are that he must 'always bear the name of Pip,'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.012"/> Herbert quickly convinces him to change it to 'Handel." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s27.28;p3.10">Similarly, on his arrival in London Magwitch assumes the name 'Provis' because 'it's as good as another'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.014"/> and Mr Wopsle works under the name ' Mr Waldengarver'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.015"/> at the theatre. </s>
<s n="s28.28;p3.10">Perhaps these characters are influenced by the city itself because according to W.H. Auden "the lonely are battered slowly like pebbles into fortuitous shapes[by the city.]"<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.016"/> Indeed, Wemmick divides his social identity between his work for Mr Jagger's in London and his country residence the 'castle.' </s>

<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.9;p4.10">Dickens employs the first person narrative to convey the inner thoughts of young Pip. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.10">As a result, the reader is able to witness the slow formation of Pip's social identity, as he experiences Lacan's definition of inner and outer reality when he reveals 'I and my conscience showed ourselves'<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.017"/> and during his illness ' I confounded impossible existences with my own identity." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s3.9;p4.10">It exists as an entity apart from himself. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.10">In contrast, the motif of hands that runs throughout the novel is perhaps symbolic of social realities and identities interweaving. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.10">Mr Jagger's obsessive-compulsive hand washing is a negative response to the crowds of people that wait outside his office; he does not like his social reality being invaded. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.10">Whilst, the joining of Pip and Estella's hands at the end of the novel is not only reminiscent of Milton's <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> but also symbolic of divided social identities being united among the neutral space of the ruins of Sattis House. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.10">The cyclical motion of events suggests that Dickens believes place is irrelevant in forming the social identity. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.10">In truth, identity is manufactured and maintained by interpellation within society and Pip must find his place among the social strata of Joe and Estella. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.10">As Eiichi Hara highlights "the human psyche simply locates itself within a range of subject positions already available within society's language and ideology." <ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.019"/> </s>

<s n="s1.19;p5.10">Like Dickens, Alan Warner constructs Morvern in <hi rend="italic">Morvern Callar (1995)</hi> as an orphan and writes her in the first person. </s>
<s n="s2.19;p5.10">However, unlike Pip who readily shares his emotions and ambitions, Morvern's character is decidedly nihilistic. </s>
<s n="s3.19;p5.10">Her detached and dispassionate language leave the character to act as a vacuum that reflects the equally vacuous dull world around her. </s>
<s n="s4.19;p5.10">Cristie March is keen to show that whilst Warner "glorifies and rusticates the Highlands ...[he] also represents to the reader a 'weirding' of the landscape as socio-cultural and technological change infiltrate the environment." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.020"/>
<s n="s5.19;p5.10">This evidently impacts upon Morvern's social identity and Wallace and Stevenson highlight the damaged identity common to Scottish Literature is expressed through " a failure to find - or accept- self-fulfilment in education, work, emotional relationships; [and] inarticulacy." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s6.19;p5.10">Indeed, " in Scottish novels...protagonists, are rarely, if ever, in control of their existences, and [are] morbidly aware of the fact." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.022"/>
<s n="s7.19;p5.10">However, we are reminded of Samuel Beckett's <hi rend="italic">Happy Days (1963)</hi> in the openness of her simplistic language and linear narrative, which suggest a child that has yet to form her social identity. </s>
<s n="s8.19;p5.10">Morvern makes two key ethical decisions that shape her social identity. </s>
<s n="s9.19;p5.10">The first is her decision not to report the death of her boyfriend and the second is the theft of his novel and essentially his identity when she puts her name on the manuscript. </s>
<s n="s10.19;p5.10">In this act, Warner is perhaps exploring Roland Barthes 'the death of the author' hypothesis, in which he argues that the author cannot claim any absolute authority over his or her text because 'to give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified.' </s>
<s n="s11.19;p5.10">Warner experiments with these ideas both in the title and content of the novel. </s>
<s n="s12.19;p5.10">Not only does the male author distance himself by constructing a female character, but also the name itself, <hi rend="italic">Morvern Callar,</hi> is asexual and genderless. </s>
<s n="s13.19;p5.10">By confusing issues of gender Warner is able to lend existential qualities to his protagonist and he is able to limit extra-diegetic interaction and therefore prevent her social identity being formed in relation to the author.This gender confusion is extended to Morvern's preoccupation with names. </s>
<s n="s14.19;p5.10">She plays with the construction of identity by nicknaming her stepfather 'Red Hanna' and her co-workers 'Tequila Sheila,' 'Smugslug' and ' Creeping Jesus." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.023"/>
<s n="s15.19;p5.10">Whilst, these names deny the character's true identity, she foregrounds the lack of her boyfriend's name by referring to him as 'He." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.024"/>
<s n="s16.19;p5.10">The capitalization is usually reserved for references to God and is suggestive of a divine authorship or father figure status in Morvern's life. </s>
<s n="s17.19;p5.10">Indeed, the large age gap between the two could perhaps be construed as Oedipal re-enaction of a father and daughter relationship. </s>
<s n="s18.19;p5.10">Morvern, like the characters created by Jeannette Winterson, is detached from the body she occupies and her ritualistic toe painting, smoking and obsession with clothes are not simply a preoccupation with the teen culture but an attempt to integrate her inner and outer reality. </s>
<s n="s19.19;p5.10">Ironically, this disjointed sense of self allows her to interact with the corpse of her dead boyfriend without ethical dilemma; 'what you do is divide the limbs and wrap them in a good few layers of bin liner.' <ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.025"/> </s>

<s n="s9.16;p6.10">This elision leaves an undercurrent of inexplicable silences throughout the novel, which are perhaps Warner's exploration of the Lacanian 'Real.' </s>
<s n="s10.16;p6.10">Morvern is experiencing an 'other' reality that exists outside her idiolect. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p6.10">Unable to express herself verbally, Morvern turns to her compilation tapes to convey her emotions and express herself. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p6.10">Perhaps then our sense of self can be expressed more fully in the space of technology. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p6.10">Indeed, Morvern attempts to reconstruct her social identity by moving to Spain and taking part in the raves. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p6.10">Through the technology of music she is temporarily able to fulfil her Lacanian lack and find freedom because 'you didn't really have your body as your own, it was part of the dance, the music, the rave." </s>

<s n="s15.16;p6.10">Warner was praised by critics for his portrayal of the "profound anomie of the rave scene"<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.031"/> but he is keen to highlight that "such a lifestyle results in a flattening of experience"<ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.032"/> and all the while she chooses to listen to the music of her dead boyfriend because the rave culture is real no substitute for the emotional void in her life. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p6.10">Eventually she must return to her roots, like Pip, and confront her true social identity, indeed Warner extends this search into the sequel <hi rend="italic">These Demented Lands (1997)</hi> where Morvern goes to visit the island where her foster mother's grave lies. </s>
