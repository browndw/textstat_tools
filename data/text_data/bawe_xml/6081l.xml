<s n="s1.3;p1.32">Water is present in every food, its content is of great significance in many respects, affecting properties like conductivity for heat and electrical current, density and rheological behavior, or even corrosiveness. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.32">The amount of water in food often determines its nutritive value and taste. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.32">Determine the water content of foodstuffs is important and there are four main method, oven-drying, distillation, electrical methods and chemical methods. </s>

<p n="p2.32">
<s n="s1.4;p2.32">Plants store their surplus energy in two forms - starch or oil. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.32">Starch is stored in underground plant organs such as roots and tubers, as well as in above-ground fruits and seeds. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.32">Starch varies in size, shape, appearance of striations and the location of the hilum from different plants. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.32">We can identify the starch in plant by using the different appearance of starch. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.32">
<s n="s1.1;p3.32">In these experiments, we use oven-drying to determine the water in the sausage meat, and also learn how to use the microscopic to exam the starch cell in different position. </s>

<head rend="bold">Discussion:</head>
<p n="p16.32">
<s n="s1.1;p16.32">After the experiment was carried out properly according to the steps described above, the experiment results and findings are discussed as follows: </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.32">
<s n="s1.1;p17.32">The water content of sausage meat is 44% to 46%, which can be compared to the literature value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.32">
<s n="s1.1;p18.32">The errors might be affect as described below: </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.32">
<s n="s1.1;p19.32">First of all, during oven-drying, water can be formed between aldose sugars (i.e.glucose) and proteins by chemical reaction, so that the result of water content might be higher. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.32">
<s n="s1.6;p20.32">Secondly, under high temperature the unsaturated fats(C=C) may react with Oxygen which is in the air, leading to a result of low water content. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p20.32">Unsaturated fats contains double bond(C=C), it exist in two forms, cis and trans, this depends on the arrangement of proportion of the molecules around the double bond. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.32">The Food and Drug Administration has proposed labeling of trans fatty acids in foods, whereas naturally occurring fatty acid are in the cis conformation. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.32">What's more, the location of double bonds in the chain can also change the nature of the fatty acid. the double bonds in lipid molecules can react with oxygen. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.32">While the lipid are oxidized, it will leads to what is termed rancidity. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p20.32">Further more, Fats that contain double bonds tend to be liquid at room temperature. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.32">
<s n="s1.1;p21.32">Next, the mixed of the presence of volatile compounds with water will also affect the result of water content. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.32">
<s n="s1.1;p22.32">Last but not least, during the experiment, while we want to transport the dish, we can't touch it by our hands, if so, the grease on our fingers may moved onto the dish. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.32">
<s n="s1.1;p23.32">What's more, result also depends on the time we heated it up. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.32">
<s n="s1.2;p24.32">In addition, although the amount of water in food determines its nutritive value and taste, in some cases it can be considered as an impurity. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.32">In reference materials, the water content is important as far as specification are given on the basis of either dry matter or initial mass. </s>
