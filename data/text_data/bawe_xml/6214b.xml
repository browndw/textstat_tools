<s n="s2.4;p6.128">Hydroponic crops obtain their total nutrient requirement from soluble inorganic salts whilst aquaculture generally discharges nutrient-rich wastewater to maintain fish health (Lucas &amp; Southgate, 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.128">Aquaponics is the integration of recirculating aquaculture and hydroponic crop production (Rackocy, 2004) and mirrors the natural process of nitrogen uptake that would occur in an aquatic ecosystem; the fish waste acting as a nutrient-source for the plants, which, in turn remove unwanted products from the aquaculture system (fig. </s>

<head rend="bold">Literature review</head>
<p n="p11.128">
<s n="s1.5;p11.128">Food production has recently come under scrutiny from the environmental lobby and the media, whilst the depletion of sea fish stocks through over fishing means that on-shore fish farms may become more prevalent in coming years (Purvis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.128">Warm water species such as Tilapia and Barramundi are already beginning to be farmed in intensive, indoor fish farms in the UK (New Forest Barramundi, 2006, Times Online, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.128">An increase in the number of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in the last ten years (DEFRA 2005; Appendix 1) and concerns regarding the amount of nitrogenous waste entering the environment (Hooper, 2006) means these businesses may find it increasingly difficult to dispose of their waste products. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.128">In addition, industries such as horticulture and agriculture are also being made aware of the need to use non-renewable energy sources and water more wisely. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.128">Aquaponics goes some way to reducing the environmental impact of food production in the following ways: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Increased efficiency in waste management and water conservation (Wilson, 2006)</item>
<item>Reduced energy use per unit of produce</item>
<item>Compatibility with urban situation can reduce the 'carbon footprint' by cutting down on pollution caused by transportation ("food miles") (ibid) </item>
<item>Increased crop yields compared with soil-based systems as well as conventional hydroponic systems (Savidov, 2006)</item>
</list>
<p n="p12.128">
<s n="s1.1;p12.128">The above factors also go some way to increasing the profitability of both the aquaculture and horticultural produce. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.128">
<s n="s1.4;p13.128">Disadvantages in aquaponic production systems include high start-up costs and reliance upon skilled staff to create and maintain a nutrient-balanced system. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.128">Knowledge of both crop production and fish rearing is required, and thus most current systems are personal hobbies, small, family-run businesses, or academic demonstrations of the technique. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.128">The time required before the grower sees the benefits of an aquaponic system must also be seen as a drawback. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.128">It is currently estimated that growth in aquaponic systems will not reach its full potential until at least six, and ideally twelve months of operation (Savidov 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.128">
<s n="s1.7;p14.128">The intensive nature of large-scale food production in the UK probably limits potential for diversification into aquaponics to smaller growers. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.128">One possibility, is for aquaponics to be used to produce organic fish and organic hydroponic fruits/vegetables under glass. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.128">However, current rulings, in the UK at least, by regulatory bodies such as The Soil Association stipulate that produce must be grown in soil to be certified organic. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.128">The need to work in harmony with soil flora and fauna means that even organically-derived nutrient solutions are not acceptable. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.128">It could be argued however that soilless growing preserves the soil-borne organisms as the soil is left completely undisturbed. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.128">Furthermore, recent work at the Crops Research Centre in Alberta, Canada suggests that the micro-organisms may be key to the success of an aquaponic system, Savidov (2006) noting that the 200% increase in Genovese basil yield over four years was likely due to bio-stimulants released by populations of benthic organisms. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.128">Atkin and Nichols (2004), using manure-derived nutrient solutions in conventional hydroponics, researched the possibility of organic hydroponics in New Zealand but the results were disappointing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.128">
<s n="s1.8;p15.128">The major wastes from aquaculture and the major fertilisers for crop production are ammonia in its ionic form, ammonium (NH <hi rend="sub">4</hi>+) and nitrate (NO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>-), as well as phosphates (PO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>3-). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p15.128">Other chemical by-products of fish production may also serve as plant micronutrients. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p15.128">This has meant a wide range of crops, including cucumbers (<hi rend="italic">Cucumis sativus</hi>), beans (<hi rend="italic">Vicia faba</hi>) (McMurty, 1986), strawberries (<hi rend="italic">Fragaria x ananassa</hi>) (Takeda <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1997), tomatoes (<hi rend="italic">Solanum lycopersicum</hi>) and melons (<hi rend="italic">Cucumis</hi> spp.) (UVI, 2001) have been successfully grown using aquaponics in previous experiments. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p15.128">A large proportion successful research, however has used lettuce and leafy herbs in the hydroponic component of the system, possibly because of its lower demand for potassium (K) (Resh, 1995), a nutrient not generally found in high concentrations in fish-culture water. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p15.128">Furthermore, with only one growth stage (as a commercial crop) lettuce does not generally require the change in nutrient formula of a fruiting crop such as tomatoes, as it begins to produce flowers and fruit (ibid). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p15.128">Lettuce is a widely grown crop in the UK and can be produced under glass all year-round. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p15.128">It is feasible that growers could consider using an aquaponic system to create a second income stream from fish farming alongside lettuce production, simultaneously reducing their fertiliser budget. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p15.128">It is possible to supplement the aquaculture water with plant nutrients harmless to fish (Rakocy <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2004, Chaves et al, 2000) or even grow fish in complete hydroponic nutrient solution (Seawright et al, 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.128">
<s n="s1.5;p16.128">Previous studies in aquaponics have often been carried out as aquaculture-based research projects, the hydroponic crop being seen as a by-product of the low-tech biological filtration. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.128">The majority of these systems have farmed warm water Tilapia (<hi rend="italic">Oreochromis spp.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.128">) in the aquaculture portion of the system, as these fish reach saleable size quickly and tolerate high nitrate loading in their grow-out tanks (Dontje et al, 1999). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.128">Successful trials have been carried out using cold water species such as trout (McMurty, 1986), but owing to the lower stocking densities tolerated by cold water species (due to relatively high oxygen demand), research has tended to favour warm water species. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.128">Most studies have included edible fish; however, a proposed project to take place in the Netherlands will use ornamental fish (Aquaponics Journal, 2006). </s>

<head rend="bold">Figure 1.2: Aquaponic lettuce production at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI 2001)</head>
</figure>
<p n="p17.128">
<s n="s1.8;p17.128">The hydroponic production method has varied in previous trials. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p17.128">Where Nutrient film Technique (NFT) has been twinned with fish production systems with dedicated solids removal, aeration and biological filtering, floating polystyrene rafts have been used in gullies of aquaculture effluent (Fig. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p17.128">1.2) (UVI, 2001, Rakocy, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p17.128">In substrate-based systems, the movement of the water through the medium provides aeration and can be used to provide mechanical solids filtering as well as providing the necessary surface to be colonised by nitrifying bacteria (Lennard &amp; Leonard, 2004, McMurty, 1986). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p17.128">Indeed the necessity of removing solid waste from aquaponic systems is a current cause of disagreement amongst hobbyists and researchers such as Rackocy, Lennard and Savidov. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p17.128">Anecdotal evidence from Rakocy at The University of the Virgin Islands also suggests that the balance of macro and micronutrients can be controlled by altering the amount of solid waste removed from the fish production element, although no work has been published in support of this theory. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p17.128">Jones (1997) also notes that non-ionic soil-borne substances such as amino acids, simple proteins, carbohydrates and urea can be assimilated in conventional soil-based cultivation by mass flow and contribute to plant growth. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p17.128">Substrate-filled grow beds may also have practical advantages such as temperature regulation and water-holding capacity if pumps fail. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.128">
<s n="s1.2;p18.128">Flood-and-drain and continuous flow irrigation have been trialled, with initial work suggesting that reciprocating flow (flood and drain) provided greater aeration and more even nutrient distribution through the substrate (McMurty, 1997 cited in Lennard &amp; Leonard, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.128">Lennard and Leonard (2004) however disproved this theory, attaining higher yield [lettuce], higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and smaller water losses from a continuous-flow irrigation system. </s>

<p n="p19.128">
<s n="s1.2;p19.128">As Jones (1997) comments, although there Have been many published formulas for the preparation of hydroponic nutrient solutions from as long ago as the late 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, the appropriate tailoring of the concentration of each constituent to the crop and production method is still largely down to the personal preference of the grower. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.128">Madestein UK Ltd, a well established produced of lettuce plants, supplied the formulation used for the control treatment in this trial. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.128">
<s n="s1.3;p20.128">The effects of nutrient deficiency on the appearance and growth of plants is well documented and hydroponic nutrient solutions need to provide a complete spectrum of essential nutrients for crop growth and often supply these elements in excess to ensure maximum crop growth. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.128">Whilst many of these elements can have a deleterious effect on growth at high concentrations, supplying nutrients at supra-optimal levels ensures that assimilates are not used to produce excess root as the plant is forced to 'forage' for nutrition. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.128">Authors such as Resh (1995 and 2006) and Jones (1993) suggest the following approximate concentrations for lettuce production: </s>

<head rend="bold">Nutrient content of aquaculture waste</head>
<p n="p21.128">
<s n="s1.3;p21.128">Waste products from aquaculture are either solid, organic matter, or aqueous, inorganic compounds, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus based. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.128">Whilst the majority of these compounds are not lethal to fish, it is beneficial to keep levels low as the effects on human health of eating fish grown in nutrient laden water are not entirely understood (Lucas and Southgate 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.128">Methaemoglobinemia, or 'blue baby syndrome' due to high levels if nitrate in drinking water, however is well documented (Hooper 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.128">
<s n="s1.4;p22.128">Failure to remediate the water used in a recirculating fish production system may lead to a reduction of efficiency of fish production (Stickney 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.128">High levels of nitrate and phosphate in such systems left unchecked lead to the build up of algae, which must be removed, adding to the operating costs. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.128">Intensive aquaculture systems, even those that recirculate water from the growth tanks, produce a high density of waste products, and must either remove a portion of the water (usually on a daily basis (New Forest Barramundi 2006)) to maintain acceptable levels of aqueous waste or remove unwanted compounds on site. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.128">This may be followed by water re-use or by discharging the cleaner effluent into watercourses or sewage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.128">
<s n="s1.3;p23.128">Effluent treatment may consist of removal of inorganic nutrients through sewage treatment e.g. constructed wetlands, or expensive denitrification steps in recirculating systems. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.128">Secondary and tertiary water treatments before disposal may significantly reduce aquaculture profits and may mean large outlay for no return. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.128">Whilst a retrofitted hydroponics setup is costly, this outlay can be recouped from the sale of crops unlike the capital invested in reed bed treatment for example (Lucas &amp; Southgate 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.128">
<s n="s1.3;p24.128">Solids removal is another costly but necessary process in recirculating fish farms. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.128">The break-down of faecal matter in the growth tanks uses oxygen as well as obstructing water flow. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.128">Most systems for solids removal rely upon belt removal or vortex generators that allow solids to collect at the bottom of a conical tank enabling minimal water loss in their removal (New Forest Barramundi 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.128">
<s n="s1.7;p25.128">Fish farms in Israel, where environmental conditions and scarcity of water may be limiting factors, have incorporated greenhouse technology into aquaculture to control humidity, light and temperature (Kolkovski <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.128">2003). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.128">This, as in controlled environment horticulture, gives producers greater control over the growth rate and quality of their product. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.128">In order to maximise available water, producers use super intensive recirculating systems, with up to 100kg of fish per cubic metre of water, meaning 10% of the water volume is fish biomass. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.128">Incorporating hydroponics into such systems have successfully produced crop yields twice that of conventional agriculture in the same region (ibid). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p25.128">Savidov (2006) has also researched the potential for aquaponics in a cool-climate, protected cropping scenario. </s>

<p n="p26.128">
<s n="s1.3;p26.128">Aquaponics does not merely combine the technology of aquaculture and hydroponics. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.128">Recent theories by aquaponics researchers on the importance of a well established microbial population on plant growth e.g. those of Savidov (2006) are echoed in the work of hydroponics researchers such as Vernieri <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (2006). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.128">These works reinforce the ideas of aquaponics proponents who believe the method to represent a more holistic approach to crop production by harnessing natural plant, animal and microbial interaction in order to reduce external inputs. </s>

<p n="p27.128">
<s n="s1.7;p27.128">The horticultural focus of this study made goldfish (<hi rend="italic">Carassius auratus</hi>) a sensible choice for the fish component of the system as they are hardier, and thus require less specialist care, than tropical or commercial food species. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p27.128">Cold water aquaria present less of a problem when attempting to maintain levels of dissolved oxygen as lower temperatures allow for higher amounts of the gas to be dissolved. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p27.128">As the tank water would be flowing past respiring plant roots and there would potentially be a large amount of decomposing fish waste in the grow beds, both of which consume oxygen, a cold water set-up was considered more appropriate. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p27.128">With no need to heat the aquaria water, there was also reduced risk of equipment failure. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p27.128">Furthermore, as goldfish flake food is approximately 40% protein, which is, in turn 16% nitrogen (Wurts 2006) this species would excrete more nitrogen-rich waste. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p27.128">Most literature aimed at hobby-aquarists stress the need to feed goldfish only moderately as they will consume much more food than they require, leading to a rapid deterioration of water quality (O'Neill 2004). </s>

<s n="s4.9;p109.128">A unit weight of 18.7g was recorded, meaning that the total weight of fish in each tank during trials 1-3 and trial 4 equated to 2.14kg m <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> and 4.27kg m <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> respectively. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p109.128">When compared to commercial stocking densities up to 17 kg m <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> in the UVI systems and up to 100kg m <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> in super-intensive aquaculture systems (Lucas &amp; Southgate 2003) the aquaponic crop growth rates observed in this project, especially in trials 2 and 4 must be seen as encouraging. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p109.128">The brands of fish food used during the project contained approximately 40% protein. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p109.128">In turn, proteins consist of around 16% nitrogen (Wurts, 2005). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p109.128">In a commercial system, where the food conversion ratio of a fish species is known, it is possible to estimate how much protein will be converted to fish biomass and how much will enter the water as ammonia. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p109.128">However, these calculations can be further complicated when the conversion of ammonia to nitrates is considered, with the rate of nitrification being dependent upon water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (Stickney 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p110.128">
<s n="s1.5;p110.128">The growth of plants in the aquaponic treatments was up to ten times lower than the control plants in the first three trials. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p110.128">In addition, appearance of the plants in these treatments during the first trial suggested some nutrient deficiencies; the leaves of the plants were thicker and more brittle than those in the control treatment. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p110.128">Their dark green appearance and the generally stunted growth was consistent with a phosphorus deficiency (Jones 1997; Salisbury and Ross 1992). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p110.128">As aquaria nitrate concentrations did not rise above 40 ppm during the first three trials, it is also reasonable to suggest this low rate of growth was also significant of nitrogen deficiency. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p110.128">It is worthy of note, however, that no chlorosis was observed, often apparent in plants starved of nitrogen (ibid). </s>
</p>
<p n="p111.128">
<s n="s1.7;p111.128">Other than the above, there were no other outward signs of mineral deficiencies. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p111.128">The use of mains water, which contains traces of both macro- and micro-nutrients (Thames Water 2005) (Appendix 3), twinned with the lack of solids-removal may help to explain this. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p111.128">Leaf tissue analysis of plants from the aquaponic treatments in trials 2 and 4 showed concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the normal range for lettuce (Jones 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p111.128">Whilst leaf concentrations of phosphorus and potassium are good indicators of the levels of these elements available to the plant, excess available nitrogen can lead to 'luxury uptake' (Greenwood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1980). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p111.128">It is worth noting that in the final trial, the aquaponic treatment showed higher leaf tissue concentrations of nitrogen than the control treatment, presumably because the nitrate levels in this treatment did not fall as rapidly as those in the control, exposing the plants to more nitrogen over the 21 days. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p111.128">In temperate zones where there are periods of low light during the year, the propensity for leafy salads to store excess nitrogen as NO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- means that lettuce are routinely tested for nitrate concentration (Assured Produce 1997). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p111.128">The possibility of higher nitrate concentrations in aquaponically-produced lettuce may therefore be in need of further investigation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p112.128">
<s n="s1.3;p112.128">Root to shoot ratio in the second and third trials were higher in the aquaponics treatments than in the control, suggesting a lack of available nutrients. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p112.128">Salisbury &amp; Ross (1992) imply that this is most indicative of low nitrogen availability, which is borne out by low recorded NO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- concentrations in the fish tanks of these treatments during these trials compared to the control tanks. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p112.128">Low levels of root production in the aquaponic treatments in trial 1 may also be indicative of low phosphorus availability at that early stage in the project. </s>
</p>
<p n="p113.128">
<s n="s1.3;p113.128">Small necrotic spots surrounded by a yellow halo were also observed on the plants from the aquaponic treatments (Figure 3.21), which was identified as an early infection of <hi rend="italic">Xanthomonus campestris</hi> (Agrios 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p113.128">Whilst necrotic lesions can also be indicative of magnesium deficiency, the symptoms were not confined to inter-venal regions, and thus the initial diagnosis was accepted. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p113.128">The control plants did not show any sign of such infection, one possible reason being the vigour with which they were growing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p114.128">
<s n="s1.8;p114.128">The brown appearance of the roots of plants from the aquaponic treatments in the second trial would seem to suggest that there may have been at least some occurrence of anoxic pockets of water within the substrate, causing root death. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p114.128">Sampling of the dissolved oxygen in the irrigation water (when the water temperature was 17 °C) showed levels of approximately 8mg l <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p114.128">This is within the desired range for freshwater aquaria and well above the minimum levels acceptable for good growth in hydroponic crops (Goto <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1996). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p114.128">Continuous flow systems through a substrate can lead to the water taking a 'path of least resistance' through the particles with some areas flooded but not moving. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p114.128">In such areas, denitrification (nitrate reduced to nitrogen gas) can even occur. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p114.128">Such a phenomenon would perhaps explain why some root tissue appeared necrotic. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p114.128">The root systems of these plants tended also to trap solid fish excreta and hence impede the flow of oxygenated water past the roots, possibly another reason for the root death. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p114.128">Dense root mats can be problematic in conventional Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) hydroponics where they can also starve themselves of oxygen by reducing solution penetration into the root mass (Jones 1997) </s>
</p>
<p n="p115.128">
<s n="s1.5;p115.128">The fluctuations in nitrate content of the aquaria water during the first three trials would appear to suggest that the fish stocking rates and hence feed input were insufficient to produce the amount of nitrogen required by the plants. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p115.128">However, during the third trial, nitrate levels remained at 40 ppm for the entire trial. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p115.128">During this period (early October) day temperatures in the glasshouse were noticeably lower than in previous trials (Appendix 4). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p115.128">The corresponding fall in water temperature in the aquaria may have reduced the feeding rate of the fish, meaning less protein from the food was converted to fish biomass and more uneaten food may have merely decomposed than in previous trials. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p115.128">The lower temperatures also corresponded to lower rates of plant growth, and thus less demand for nitrogen, although nitrate concentrations in the control systems did fall in line with the two previous trials. </s>
</p>
<p n="p116.128">
<s n="s1.3;p116.128">Higher growth rates (although not significantly) were observed in the aquaponic + Fe treatments in the first two trials but not in the third. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p116.128">Furthermore, only in the second trial did the addition if iron to the aquaponic systems have a significant effect on leaf chlorophyll content. </s>

</p>
<p n="p117.128">
<s n="s1.5;p117.128">Plants are able to grow well in soilless systems where mineral concentrations are as low as those in soil solutions, as long as the nutrients can be replenished at a comparable rate to their uptake (Salisbury and Ross 1992). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p117.128">This continual renewal is central to the success of an aquaponic system, where levels of nitrate, for example remain much lower than those found in conventional hydroponics. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p117.128">From a fish-rearing perspective, treatment of aquaculture effluents are seen as problematic, especially in open systems, as the large volume flows carry relatively dilute nutrients (Adler <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2000). </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p123.128">
<s n="s1.3;p123.128">The project demonstrated the ability of aquaponic systems to produce lettuce (<hi rend="italic">Lactuca sativa</hi> cv. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p123.128">'<hi rend="italic">Trinity</hi>') using goldfish (<hi rend="italic">Carassius auratus</hi>) aquaria as the nutrient source albeit at a slower rate than the control hydroponic treatment. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p123.128">The rate at which lettuce can be produced in these systems related directly to the amount of food added to the aquatic portion of the systems, which would normally be in direct relation to the stocking density of the fish used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p124.128">
<s n="s1.2;p124.128">Although the hydroponic control treatments produced a greater crop yield in three of the four trials, it is worth considering the amount of water used and the cost in terms of financial outlay for the inorganic nutrients and in terms of the energy used to produce these chemicals. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p124.128">Aquaponic systems also have the advantage of producing two saleable products and, as has been demonstrated in the United States, the possibility of generating further income from agri-tourism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p125.128">
<s n="s1.2;p125.128">Although there are obvious benefits to producing crops using aquaponic systems, the likelihood of commercial-scale aquaponic production occurring in the UK in the near future must be seen as unlikely. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p125.128">It is possible however, that large increases in energy costs and restrictions on water use and pollution discharge may make such techniques more important in years to come. </s>

<head rend="bold">Future Work</head>
<p n="p126.128">
<s n="s1.5;p126.128">It was apparent towards the end of this project that the expanded clay aggregate bio-filters/grow-beds were not large enough to cope with 5 months of goldfish faeces. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p126.128">It became necessary during the later trials to periodically remove the plug at the end of the irrigation hose to remove some solids from the pipe. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p126.128">Larger, deeper bio-filters would therefore enable the retention of more soild waste and possibly, therefore higher concentrations of micronutrients and micro-organisms. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p126.128">Lennard and Leonard (2006) assessed the comparative abilities of gravel bed, floating raft and NFT hydroponic systems to remove fish-derived nutrients in an aquaponics system, concluding gravel beds worked most efficiently. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p126.128">Combinations of grow-bed volume and various substrates could therefore be trialled along with the removal or retention of fish faeces. </s>
</p>
<p n="p127.128">
<s n="s1.4;p127.128">Now suggested as being an important factor in aquaponic systems, populations of water borne micro flora and micro fauna take some time to establish. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p127.128">Savidov (2006 in Wilson 2006) has suggested that for populations of these organisms to reach useful size may take up to twelve months, and that from that point forward aquaponics can outperform conventional hydroponics in terms of crop yield. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p127.128">A full investigation of these theories is currently under way by Savidov (Wilson 2006), however the limited time-scale for this project must be cited as a major limiting factor in view of these preliminary hypotheses. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p127.128">Possibly, future research could assess the effects of commercially-available plant boistimulants in aquaponics where 'virgin' aquaculture systems are used to provide crop nutrition. </s>
</p>
<p n="p128.128">
<s n="s1.1;p128.128">Finally, the increasing need to reduce energy consumption also presents the possibility of using warm water fish production alongside glasshouse crops to store excess heat during periods of high temperatures to reduce the need for night-time heating. </s>
