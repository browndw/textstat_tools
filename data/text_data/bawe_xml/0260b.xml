<s n="s1.7;p8.14">Their role was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the children. </s>

<s n="s7.7;p8.14">However the aim of social services is to keep the children with their mum and so have provided her household help and help in getting the children into bed in an evening and funded nursery places for the twins twice a week. </s>

<head rend="italic">Management Plan. </head>
<p n="p10.14">
<s n="s1.4;p10.14">Patient P needs a management plan tailored to what she wants. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.14">This is in line with the NHS plan, "changes for patients". </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.14">Which states that patient choice should be strengthened and their views about their care must be given greater prominance <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.14">This plan would need to meet P's biological, social and psychological needs, the "biopsycosocial approach". </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">Health Needs</head>
<p n="p11.14">
<s n="s1.6;p11.14">It is vital that P attends her 3 monthly reviews with the oncologist, this allows her progress to be monitored. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.14">To allow P to keep the appointment, child-care and transport to the clinic need to be arranged. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.14">Social services make special arrangements for these days in terms of child-care and transport. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.14">This would involve liasing with the health care team to find out the date and time of P's appointments. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.14">P's blood needs to be monitored regularly for cancer markers, to ensure early action can be taken if needed. </s>

<head rend="italic">Social Needs</head>

<s n="s1.14;p12.14">P's social needs are important in the management of her condition as her social context impedes upon her health. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p12.14">P needs help with the children, to allow her respite time to relax. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p12.14">The youngest children are not of school age and so appropriate affordable nursery care could be arranged. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p12.14">The nursery places currently provided by social services are temporary they are not a long-term measure. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p12.14">P needs financial help; this would give her the money to pay for nursery care and to cover any additional costs she may incur as a result of her illness such as transport, this may be unrealistic if P already receives all the benefits she is entitled to. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p12.14">Social services currently provide household helps, which should be continued as P finds this beneficial. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p12.14">The family needs a larger house, which would give them more space. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p12.14">This may calm the frustration and arguments that build up when people live in an overcrowded property. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p12.14">To implement this requires all agencies making a recommendation and supporting P's application to the housing association. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p12.14">However the house must also be within <name type="other"/> as this is where P wishes to stay, the children would also not have to change schools thereby limiting the disruption to their lives. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p12.14">If P wishes to remain with her current partner, the issues of domestic violence need to be addressed and resolved. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p12.14">This may involve counselling for both parties to establish why the partner uses violence and how he can control this. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p12.14">Counselling for P would help build her self-confidence. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p12.14">Efforts should also be made to encourage the family to support P and to be involved with P and her children. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="italic">Psychological Needs</head>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.5;p13.14">P needs stability and consistency, the health visitor service is key to this as it provides P with one point of contact. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.14">The health visitor can then delegate the problem to the relevant agency. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.14">This will help reassure P that her support mechanisms are still present despite finishing her treatment. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.14">One to one counselling should be offered to P, as she needs help in coming to terms with and dealing with her condition. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.14">As P worries about relapse she needs her ideas concerns and expectations listened to, reconstruction surgery could be offered, this would hopefully improve P's perception of her body image and give her self-confidence a boost. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.3;p14.14">The management plan should maximise P's recovery by alleviating the health, social and psychological problems that have impeded on her illness. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.14">By meeting these needs it aims to improve her prognosis as much as possible. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.14">For the management plan to work it requires the continued communication between all agencies involved. </s>
