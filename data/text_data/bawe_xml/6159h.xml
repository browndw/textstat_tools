<s n="s2.2;p1.27">The proposed design had the canopy angled at 20 degrees to the horizontal and orientated 30 degrees West of South, however the optimum design was angled at 30 degrees to the horizontal and facing directly South. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.27">This preliminary design stage used monocrystalline PV and assumed the array to be ventilated by natural air flows. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p4.27">As can be seen from the graph the optimum design had canopy slope angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal with the shelter facing directly South. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.27">However this optimum design gave only a 100kWh/yr increase over the proposed design. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.27">Varying the orientation of the shelter had a greater impact on the energy generation compared to varying the slope angle. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.27">For example a range of acceptable slope angles, say 5-45 degrees, had less of a range of electrical outputs than changing the orientation of the shelter from North to South facing. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p9.27">The reason for this is illustrated in the Figure 1. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.27">In order to maximise the 'view' of the sun's rays the array must be perpendicular to the rays. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.27">The optimum slope angle for Benin is 10º because of it position on the globe (latitude 6.33º N), whereas for Reading the optimum slope angle is 30º as its latitude is 51.4º N. </s>

<head rend="underlined">3.2 Financial Savings:</head>
<p n="p15.27">
<s n="s1.5;p15.27">The system is grid connected therefore during peak generation times energy can be sold back to the grid and during low generation times energy can be purchased from the grid. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p15.27">So for amorphous PV just under £200 can be saved (or earned) per year whereas for monocrystalline just under £400 can be saved (or earned) per year. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p15.27">More sophisticated methods could be used, such as Levelised production cost or Internal rate of return, to work out the 'true' economic benefits of the PV installation but here it is outside the scope of this report. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p18.27">In choosing appropriate modules for the canopy there was one main constraint to take into consideration. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p18.27">That constraint was finding a group of PVs that fit the canopy, as close to 40m <hi rend="sup">2</hi> as possible. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p18.27">The next task was to select the specific make and model that gave the highest nominal power. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p18.27">Once the nominal power had been attained the next step was to figure out an appropriate power rating for the inverter. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p18.27">The standard practise for selecting an inverter is to size it approximately 10% less than the nominal power of the array. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p18.27">The penultimate stage was to choose the ratio of series:parallel connection. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p18.27">In other words, how many strings (parallel) in the array with a certain number of modules (series) in the string. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p18.27">The more modules per string the higher the voltage. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p18.27">It is better to have more than one string in the array so losses from shading or damaged modules can be minimised. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p18.27">Generally a common way of minimising these losses regardless of the number of strings is to use bypass diodes. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p18.27">This diverts any generated current around shaded or damaged modules. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p18.27">Finally a specific inverter was selected. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p18.27">This depended on the V <hi rend="sub">mpp</hi> and V <hi rend="sub">OC</hi>, the voltage at the max power point and open circuit voltage. </s>
