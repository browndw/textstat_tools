<s n="s1.5;p1.24">The regulation of mergers forms a fundamental component of competition law and policy, evidenced by the fact that more than 80 of the 100 or so national regimes presently in operation have adopted provisions to that end<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.24">The United Kingdom, in much the same vein as other nations with similarly well-developed, complex and expansive market economies - the US, Australia and prominent EU Member States in particular - has acknowledged the importance of having such regulation and has for many years employed a system of merger control<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.24">The FTA 1973<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.003"/> provided the UK's statutory regime for 3 decades until, in 2002, the Enterprise Act<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.004"/> was passed. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.005"/>, the Government brought forth substantial reforms to the domestic system, with the bold intention of establishing a "<hi rend="italic">world class competition regime</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.24">To that end, amongst a host of other changes, the system of merger control was targeted for modernisation and accordingly, reforms to both its substantive and procedural aspects were made. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p4.24">While the FTA 1973 listed a variety of factors which might be taken into account in determining the public interest, it otherwise left the definition open-ended, and thereby left the competition authorities to determine what to take into account. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.24">This system, giving as it did enormous discretion to the authorities, fell under heavy criticism for the imprecision and uncertainty it created for UK merger control<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p5.24">The 2 major competing approaches are the abovementioned SLC test and another predominantly concerned with the strengthening of a dominant market position. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.24">Whilst an unequivocal victor has yet to emerge, given the worldwide proliferation of merger regimes, and thus from the experiences and lessons learned through their operation, certain accepted legal standards have developed which would seem on balance to favour the former of the two approaches. </s>

<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.3;p6.24">A dominance test had been employed in various European states and notably under the pre-reformed ECMR<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.012"/>, where mergers were declared incompatible with the Common Market if they created or strengthened a <hi rend="italic">dominant market position</hi> - which the Commission's decisional practice indicated would require at least 40% market share - as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.24">It might have seemed logical for the UK to follow suit, after all, one of the underlying principles of competition policy had been to make its approach consistent with the EC's<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.24">However, there are some fundamental shortcomings of the test which have been highlighted at case law, notably in Airtours/First Choice<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.014"/>, and acknowledged by numerous academic commentators, particularly in the responses to the debate launched by the EC's Green Paper on Review of Council Regulation 4064/89<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.015"/>, which provided considerable incentives to avoid its adoption. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.24">The test's major limitation is its apparent impotence in certain situations of oligopoly. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.24">In particular, it relates to cases where the merging firms would be in a position to raise prices unilaterally without holding the largest market share and without resorting to co-ordination which attracts scrutiny under the "collective dominance" theory, which itself only operates in very limited circumstances given the CFI's restrictive conditions laid out in its <hi rend="italic">Airtours</hi> decision<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.24">This so-called "enforcement gap" applies, to provide the classic example, where the market is comprised of three competitors holding 65%, 25% and 15% market shares respectively and a merger occurs between the latter two, leaving them with insufficient market share to permit a finding of a dominant position but, nevertheless, given the high degree of concentration in the market, competition concerns could readily arise<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.24">The SLC test, which does not rely on this inflexible jurisdictional threshold of market share, which must be reached before the effects on competition of the merger can be considered, bypasses these problems<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.018"/>. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.016">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">In finding that the EU Commission had stretched the boundaries of collective dominance to prohibit a transaction that might have reduced competition, but which did not give rise to a material risk of tacit collusion, the CFI imposed 3 strict conditions that had to be met for a finding of collective dominance requiring (i) sufficient market transparency, (ii) sufficient incentives to sustain collusive practice and (iii) such market conditions as to ensure the feasibility of enforcement of the common policy. </s>

<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Demonstrated, for example, in the case of Lloyds TSB/Abbey National where the employment of a SLC test enabled the OFT to refer, and the CC to ultimately prohibit, a merger where the increase in market share was relatively modest (just a 5% increase from 22% to 27%) but where the combined share of the four large banks increased to 77%. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.3;p8.24">Furthermore, it has been noted that the necessity to focus on finding a dominant position, which is essentially a legal construct, <hi rend="italic">"distracts attention away from the question of whether there is a problem created by the market structure and may encourage competition authorities to equate finding dominance with proving that there is a problem"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.019"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.24">By contrast, the SLC test has been noted for being more rooted in economics<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.020"/> meaning competition issues can be more easily and coherently addressed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.24">This, coupled with its greater comparative flexibility and sufficiently broad scope, lead to the near unanimous conclusion of commentators on the abovementioned Green Paper that the SLC test is more suitable to deal with competition concerns in merger situations<ref target="BAWE_0069e-ftnote.021"/>. </s>

<p n="p13.24">
<s n="s1.2;p13.24">Under the FTA 1973, three government bodies participated in merger regulation: the OFT, headed by the Director General of Fair Trading; the CC (the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the time) and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (SoS) - the Minister at the head of the DTI.
