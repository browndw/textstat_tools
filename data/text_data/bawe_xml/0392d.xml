<s n="s3.4;p1.11">Sex and the City appears to represent the post feminist view that women could now have it all.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.001"/> The women in sex and the city are financially independent, can go out and enjoy being women in the public sphere, and are able to compete with men in careers, relationships and finances. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.11">Since the beginning of the feminist movement sexuality has been closely linked to women's freedom from domination.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.003"/> The idea that a wife should consume, but does not require sexual gratification from her husband was championed throughout the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.004"/> However Sex and the City portrays a contemporary view of consumption sex, to be enjoyed by women as much as men. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.11">In Sex and the City sex is consumed like the rest of culture, the women seek sex like a pair of shoes and then discuss whether their needs were met amongst friends. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.11">On a more basic level the women also consume sex through sex toys the explosion of popularity in the 'rampant rabbit' vibrator was closely linked to sex and the city. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p3.11">This dichotomy draws upon the patriarchal perception of women as mother protector, or whore. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.11">Classically those women who are seen as whores are on the outset of society.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.007"/> Through portraying the women's active sexuality sex and the city challenges the dichotomy of whore or loose women, as their sexualities are contrasted with their rich lifestyles and attraction by men. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.11">However even the program itself questions the full extent these women can avoid the labelling of loose women, throughout the series the women's sexuality is questioned and in episode 41 'running with scissors' Samantha is asked by a potential sexual partner to perform an aids test confirming her position as a loose women, as well as briefly highlighting the role aids and STIs have played in the controlling of contemporary women's sexuality.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<s n="s2.8;p5.11">It appears that the any thought of marriage or the sexual contract is inexplicable to these women. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.11">However rather than spending each episode discussing the triumphs that they can achieve, these four women spend each episode, six seasons falling in love and out of love with men. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.11">Whilst the ever optimistic Charlotte is the only character who considers marriage as a goal, all the women appear to be mapping their lives through men.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.011"/> The programme certainly does not support the view that marriage or men will help solve the girls problems, it is Charlotte's perfect marriage failing that shows the viewers that even in the perfect husband there are still major flaws. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.11">However as the voice of Carrie in episode 61 'All that glitters' explains although Charlottes dream has fallen apart 'little girls in their mothers pearls' will still look at the photo shoot of the happy couple and desire to live their life. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.11">In this sense Sex and the City is recognising the historical femininities which influence contemporary culture<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.012"/>, but also recognising that this ideological life is rarely as it appears. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.11">Being single is also portrayed as problematic in episode 3 'bay of married pigs' where Miranda is mistaken to be in a lesbian relationship, through this she gains career opportunities unavailable to her when she was single. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.11">In 'the baby shower' however the girls are not enviable of the women who has just given birth but return to the city with relief.<ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.013"/> The women's friendship at many times proves to be an alternative for heterosexual dependence as they rely on each other for support, even financially, however this questions the extent of their independence as they are replacing heterosexual dependence for the dependence of friends. </s>

However whilst these single girls frequent the city, the city sphere is portrayed as being a hostile place for married women. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.11">Those women who are married as portrayed in episode 83 'a women's right to shoes' retire from the city and the city girl's life, to suburbs such as 'The Hamptons'. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.11">These women no longer spend their time and devotion on themselves represented in the shoes of this episode, but have 'grown up' and devote their time to their family and children. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.11">This questions the view that these women are completely free in their situations, or whether upon marriage they are still confined to the existing power relations within marriage. <ref target="BAWE_0392d-ftnote.017"/> </s>
