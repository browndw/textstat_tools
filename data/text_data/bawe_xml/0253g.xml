<s n="s1.4;p1.51">The Freddie Mac scandal has been one of several high profile corporate scandals in the recent past. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.51">The scandal has added to the falling reputation of auditing and crucially emphasises the case for tighter regulation and more stringent rules within the auditing profession. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.51">The question is whether the public demands on increased responsibility of auditors to detect fraud is really one that can be reasonably expected of the audit. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.51">Ultimately, this relates to the expectations gap and the issues that have surfaced as a result. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.51">
<s n="s1.2;p2.51">The purpose of this report is to highlight the areas of accountability involved in the Freddie Mac scandal focussing particularly on independence, liability and corporate governance and to discuss their impact on auditing and the profession. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.51">The report also gives some recommendations to improve the credibility of auditing. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">a) Who is Freddie Mac? </head>
<p n="p3.51">
<s n="s1.4;p3.51">Originally known as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by Congress in 1970. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.51">Freddie has a public aim to stabilise the nation's mortgage markets<ref target="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.001"/> and expand opportunities for homeownership and affordable rental housing. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.51">Primarily, Freddie's role is to serve as secondary market conduit between mortgage lenders and investors. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.51">It purchases mortgages from mortgage lenders (commercial banks and other financial institutions) and repackages them into securities (mortgage-backed and debt) which are then sold to investors. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">In the late 1960s, interest rates varied widely that the mortgage market was unpredictable and loans were hard to get. </s>

</figure>
<p n="p4.51">
<s n="s1.3;p4.51">Moreover, Freddie is a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) in which it has a distinct relationship with the Government and enjoys special perks and privileges. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.51">In addition to receiving $2.25bn in credit from the government<ref target="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.002"/>, it is exempt from state and local taxes and not subjected to standard disclosure rules imposed on other financial institutions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.51">Furthermore, Freddie Mac is regulated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) in the United States, department of Housing and Urban Development. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">b) What went wrong? </head>
<p n="p5.51">
<s n="s1.6;p5.51">The root of Freddie's problems can be found in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 133, which determines accounting rules when derivatives are used as hedges. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.51">The rules require companies to assign current market values to the interest-rate swaps, options, and other derivatives they hold and to reflect any changes in their value on the balance sheet. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.51">Additionally, companies can offset any gains (or losses) on an asset with a similar loss (or gain) on the derivative used as a hedge. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.51">Crucially, any changes in a derivative's value can be recognised over the life of the hedge, allowing companies to avoid the volatility that market-value accounting creates. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.51">Freddie took advantage of this loophole in hedge accounting to amortise gains and thus smooth company earnings, effectively boosting investor and lender confidence in the company. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.51">Additionally, the stability also helped ward off politicians who might point to volatility as a reason to tighten regulations. </s>

<p n="p8.51">
<s n="s1.8;p8.51">Much of the public think that the core of the problem was Freddie's lack of attention to the staffing, skill set and resources it set to its accounting policies. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p8.51">The policies were clearly weak or non-existent. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p8.51">Within Freddie, there were apparent deficiencies in internal controls, processes which would provide reasonable assurance and also assist in compliance testing. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p8.51">Such measure would have surely provided a safeguard against errors in financial reporting. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p8.51">It is widely held that it is the responsibility of a corporation for maintaining a control environment that will, among other things, accurately record and account for transactions. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p8.51">Many senior staff members at Freddie Mac claim that the incorrect financial reporting was <hi rend="italic">'an honest mistake</hi>." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s7.8;p8.51">If this was the case, then Freddie, undoubtedly, was over reliant on the external auditor. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p9.51">In doing so, Andersen appeared to have failed to notice the fact that Freddie kept their loan loss reserves at levels higher than that permitted by GAAP, maintaining a reserve account to cushion fluctuations in premiums and discounts resulting from mortgage prepayments. </s>

<p n="p45.51">
<s n="s1.2;p45.51">The Freddie Mac case is one of many corporate scandals that have brought attention to the failure of audits to detect material misstatements in the financial reports associated with fraud. inij As a result, there have been tangible developments in auditing, focussing on independence, corporate governance and auditor liability. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p45.51">However, this scandal was revealed six months after the introduction of SOX which addresses many of the weaknesses in auditing which were relevant to the Freddie case. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.51">
<s n="s1.3;p46.51">Nevertheless, many feel the SOX is flawed despite it being a step in the right direction. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.51">With regards to remuneration, departing executives continue to leave companies with huge severance packages which many feel is undeserved. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p46.51">Furthermore, as declared by Imhoff, despite the new five-year staff rotation rule, it is </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"only a modest improvement over the old seven-year rule and will be just as ineffective. To meet the seven-year rule the lead audit partner would be rotated off in the seventh year and then rotate back onto the engagement in the eighth year." <ref target="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.019"/>
</quote>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.019">

</p>

<p n="p47.51">
<s n="s1.1;p47.51">We can only expect similar practices regarding the new rule. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.51">
<s n="s1.3;p48.51">Imhoff then went on to suggest a three-year mandatory rotation arguing that auditors would then worry far less about losing their clients, and this in turn enhances auditor independence.<ref target="BAWE_0253g-ftnote.020"/> In our opinion however, the benefits of decreasing rotation periods to three years would be outweighed by the costs, contributed mostly by increased set-up costs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p48.51">Although such frequent rotation would break up the monopoly of the big 4 by presenting more opportunities to smaller firms, the larger firms may resort to low-balling to attain clients. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p48.51">To evaluate the benefits of rotation, it is contended that OFHEO should perform feasibility studies to determine if periodic changes of the external audit firm enhances the soundness and safety of corporations such as Freddie Mac. </s>

</note>
<p n="p49.51">
<s n="s1.4;p49.51">We also feel that the recent initiatives to monitor auditing firms' activities are crucial in restoring confidence to the auditing profession, despite irritating the firms themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p49.51">However, co-operation from the auditing firms is imperative for this to be successful. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p49.51">Additionally, it is widely pointed out that companies should take a more pro-active role in detecting and eliminating accounting misstatements and decrease their reliance on the auditors on the matter. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p49.51">In this case, however, whilst there was clear negligence on behalf of Freddie, evidence suggests that Andersen was partly liable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.51">
<s n="s1.2;p50.51">Finally, the Freddie case, explicitly reveals the need for all US companies, private and public, to be governed by the same rules. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p50.51">Scandals at Fannie Mae, Freddie's sister company, further emphasise that no company or institution should be given favourable treatment. </s>

<p n="p51.51">
<s n="s1.7;p51.51">In conclusion, auditors should realise and embrace their social responsibilities, thereby increasing their detection of material misstatements, aiding the identification of fraud. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p51.51">We believe the issues of accountability raised by the Freddie case and other scandals are embodied in the expectations gap; auditor responsibilities are unclear therefore when fraud can scandals occur, it is difficult to point fingers at who should be held accountable for misconduct. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p51.51">Before the auditing profession can successfully tackle the problems, it must first establish the objectives of auditing. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p51.51">However, objectives evolve through time to meet market demands and clearly, much of society expect external auditing to detect fraud. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p51.51">Scandals such as the Freddie case have underlined the recent weaknesses in the auditing profession. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p51.51">Although scandals continue to surface to this date, there have been credible efforts to address these problems. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p51.51">However, in what direction auditing develops in the near future will be determined by the strength of the market to influence the audit objectives and how the profession responds to such pressure. </s>
