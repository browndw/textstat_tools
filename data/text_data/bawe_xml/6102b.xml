<s n="s3.3;p2.65">More and more hi-tech products are appearing among a variety of areas, from design of integrated circuit (IC) even to the application of artificial intelligent (AI) technology which is playing an important role in the modern world. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.65">
<s n="s1.13;p3.65">AI is no longer only a movie which can not only be watched in its ever expanding influence to each corner of the world. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p3.65">The science of creating machines which can solve problems and reason like humans is usually referred to as artificial intelligence. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p3.65">AI can depend on different external situation to make a final decision like a reasonable human. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p3.65">Around us, it is easy to find that AI gives final opinions to help people make judgement on many issues in every day life. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p3.65">The most interesting application in the current age, is embedding AI technology into robot. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p3.65">However, most robots currently could only be considered as machines in our life but not intelligent. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p3.65">As stated by Murphy: "While robots are mechanical, they don't have to be anthropomorphic or even animal-like." </s>
<s n="s8.13;p3.65">For example, robot which delivers hospital meals to patients looks like a cart, not a nurse [1]. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p3.65">So the robot associated with AI technology should have the ability to solve some problem without the preprogrammed by engineer. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p3.65">Moreover, the ability of learning can not be ignored on AI robot. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p3.65">It refers that robot can feel the influence of environment automatically and program itself to search the optimized solution so that it could cope with the unpredictable issue it met. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p3.65">Subsequently, each behaviour of AI robot causes it to contact the external world, and perceive the information of feedback about the change of the world through some instrument like sensor. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p3.65">The signals received are transmitted to the control centre which affect its former target and find a new way to meet it, immediately followed by generating a new cycle of actions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.65">
<s n="s1.7;p4.65">In the mean time, from high level of programming angle, to get machines programming themselves to figure out a most suitable way to process the digital signal received, the EC method by people like John Koza of Stanford University has been used to improve this process to create such "intelligent machine". </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.65">This approach integrates the evolutional concept into computational problems to select out efficient way through searching among huge number of possibilities for solutions. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.65">In biology, the target of evolution is to produce the desired individual that is highly fit the variable environment. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.65">The individual is survived dependant upon its fitness in environment. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.65">The theory of "survival of fitness" is Darwin stuff that "through reproduction, inheritance and the occasional mutation within a population, individuals or groups of individuals with similar characteristics within that population would flourish when placed in a particular environment". </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.65">It is stated by Richard Gardiner who is trying to embed the EC method into his mobile robot "Antaeus" to make it have the learning ability, a practical experiment at Cybernetics department of Reading University. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.65">So the simplified law of evolution is a continuous circle in which the individual is evolved by random variation such as mutation and crossover, and the fittest one which has the "qualification" to survive could be picked up through natural selection, subsequently, their genetic stuff will be kept and past to a new generation to continue process in the same circle. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p6.65">This software can roughly simulate the robot control condition in the continuing changed environment. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.65">The evolutional approach which is used to modify the software is GA which was invented by John Holland in the 1960s and developed by Holland and his students and colleagues at the University of Michigan in 1960s and 1970s. </s>

<p n="p7.65">
<s n="s1.3;p7.65">Different from other evolutionary computation approaches which are used to solve specific problems, GA is to "formally study the phenomenon of adaptation as it occurs in nature and to develop ways in which the mechanisms of natural adaptation might be imported into computer system" [4]. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.65">Virtually, GA is a kind of adaptive algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p64.65">As the most popular evolutionary algorithm, the application of GA causes a great leap in development of intelligent computation. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p64.65">Through the exam on the maths function, it can be seen that GA can solve the problem of searching maximum value and first four highest peak values, moreover, compared with the figure plotted out by MATLAB, the results are precise but only a bit error around 0.01 on x value. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p64.65">Meanwhile, GA also has good performance in real world problem which is a simulation of car racing. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p64.65">Rely on the output file including time of each lap, which shows the time is getting shorter and shorter, it can be figured out that the parameter is evolved to be fitter and fitter with this search approach inspired by biology theory. </s>

<p n="p65.65">
<s n="s1.5;p65.65">However, in the area of working electronic devices, still some problem can not be solved due to scalability. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p65.65">To cope with more complex conditions, the traditional approach of EC must be added up information by human, because all the parameters in the conventional GA method need to be defined to corresponding binary value. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p65.65">It refers that the EC approach as mentioned in this report is lack of one important nature like element, development. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p65.65">As stated by Peter Bentley, who is the head of the Digital Biology Group at University College London, "The idea is that, by incorporating development, you avoid the one to one correspondence between a gene and a parameter. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p65.65">We are trying to get to the point where the genome is more like a recipe; a set of instruction should grow, rather than a complete blueprint specifying every last detail in advance."[8] So, in this open area, much work such as how to implement it into algorithm and how to incorporate with other field knowledge should be considered to improve EC to realize the dream of completely natural computation method in AI world. </s>
