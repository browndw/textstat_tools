<p n="p1.43">
<s n="s1.3;p1.43">Distribution started to take over at the end of the twentieth century as one of the most critical factors for the competitiveness of tourism organizations and destinations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.43">The development and growth of online travel, related to the expansion of information and communication technologies (ICTs), represents a paradigm shift in the tourism industry (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.43">Nowadays, electronic distribution is one of the most powerful marketing tools of the tourism sector, which is rapidly developing (O'Connor, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.43">
<s n="s1.3;p2.43">The first part of this assignment discusses theoretical issues related to distribution channels in travel and tourism. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.43">Thereafter the paper focuses on explanation of the chosen travel package and consumer profile, as well as evaluation of three different electronic distribution channels from the customer perspective. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.43">Finally, in the third part, recommendations to analysed organizations are provided. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN TOURISM</head>
<p n="p3.43">
<s n="s1.5;p3.43">Buhalis (2003) defines distribution channel as a set of interdependent organizations engaged in the process of making a product or service available for use or consumption by the consumer. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.43">The three main actors in a distribution channel are <hi rend="italic">principals,</hi> <hi rend="italic">intermediaries</hi> and <hi rend="italic">consumers.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.43">Principals can be defined as suppliers of a service in a tourism industry that provide the core product for customers to consume. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.43">Intermediaries act as a third party between sellers and buyers that help principals to promote, sell and distribute their products or services to final buyers (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.43">Consumers are the final users of the product or service. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.43">
<s n="s1.12;p4.43">Principals can be distributed through various different channels. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p4.43">In the first channel, direct channel, customers communicate directly with the tourism supplier. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p4.43">This channel can be the most cost-effective form principals' perspective as there are no intermediaries requiring a commission. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p4.43">In the second channel of distribution, the referral network, principals such as branded hotel and restaurant chains, use each individual retail outlet to promote the other properties of the chain (Bowie and Buttle, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.12;p4.43">On the other hand, principals often choose to use the services of an intermediary, which take different forms. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p4.43">Travel agents can be used as an intermediary; they advise and sell a range of holidays as well as other tourism offerings to potential and existing customers and in return receive a commission from the principal (Lumsdon, 1997). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p4.43">The fourth channel of distribution involves tour operator as an intermediary. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p4.43">Tour operators are wholesalers and act as consolidators. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p4.43">Their most significant contribution in the distribution channel is development of tourism packages, which are then marketed to consumers directly. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p4.43">The fifth distribution channel consists of tour operator and travel agent as intermediaries. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p4.43">Here tour operators use travel agents to promote their all-inclusive tourism packages and pay them a commission for any bookings made (Bowie and Buttle, 2004). </s>
<s n="s12.12;p4.43">O'Connor (1999) suggests another distribution channel in tourism, the one that includes government tourism organizations that also act as intermediaries, distributing information and brochures for tourism suppliers within their region. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.43">
<s n="s1.9;p5.43">Along with the technological revolution several additional players have emerged, such as Computer Reservation Systems (CRSs), Global Distribution Channels (GDSs) and Destination Management Systems (DMSs), facilitating the distribution of tourism products. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.43">CRSs originally appeared in the early 1960s as the internal inventory systems developed by airlines. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.43">They can be defined as computerized systems that 'assist tourism enterprises with handling their inventories profitably and with facilitating the tourism products distribution' (Buhalis, 2003, p. 93). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.43">They have become powerful wealth-creating tools of tourism industry and have become profit centres in their own right (Poon, 1994). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.43">Airline computer reservations systems subsequently evolved into global distribution systems (GDSs). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.43">These can be described as 'super switches' connecting several CRSs and linking principals to intermediaries anywhere in the world (Inkpen, 1998). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.43">Today's GDS are a convenient electronic tool for all travel information and reservation needs, and have therefore become a necessary channel of distribution for any product sold through travel agencies (O'Connor, 1999). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.43">There are currently four major GDS systems: Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan (Cooper <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2005). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.43">DMSs are another player in a tourism distribution channel and can be described as collections of computerized information accessible about a specific destination, usually managed by destination management organizations (DMOs). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.43">
<s n="s1.9;p6.43">The continuous development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) during the last decade has had major implications for the tourism industry as a whole. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.43">ICTs have introduced a variety of opportunities and challenges and have revolutionized tourism distribution channels and relationships between principals, intermediaries and consumers significantly (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.43">As tourism suppliers have a constant need to reduce distribution costs, the opportunity to reach customers in a global market directly has led to a substantial amount of avoiding traditional intermediaries. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.43">This phenomenon is called <hi rend="italic">disintermediation</hi> and is enabled by ICTs which decrease coordination and communication costs (Werthner and Klein, 1999). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.43">Arguments for the disintermediation are that it enables principals to directly communicate with customers as well as reduce their distribution costs and consequently the prices as well. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.43">Nevertheless, disintermediation also has its disadvantages, leading to an exploding number of links for principals and customers as well as a poor integration of services from different independent sources (Werthner and Klein, 1999). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.43">Reintermediation has occurred as a result, leading to intermediaries adjusting their service offerings to the needs and opportunities of an electronic sales channel while providing added value for their customer at a reasonable price. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.43">New companies, called cybermediaries, have emerged, finding innovative ways of adding value on the Web (Werthner and Klein, 1999). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.43">Moreover, nowadays complex tourism networks are emerging on the Web with players cooperating and competing at the same time, leading to the phenomenon of coopetition. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">WEB INTERMEDIARIES and TRAVEL E-BUSINESS TYPOLOGY</head>
<p n="p7.43">
<s n="s1.12;p7.43">Information and communication technologies (ICTs) gradually change the distribution function from information exchange and reservations to a much more sophisticated mechanism of adding value and providing service. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p7.43">With the proliferation of the Internet a whole range of new eTourism intermediaries has emerged. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p7.43">According to travel e-business typology adapted from Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p7.43">(2000) web intermediaries can be classified into five different categories: aggregators, integrators, infomediaries, alliance and marketplace (auction sites) (Bowie and Paraskevas, 2006). </s>
<s n="s5.12;p7.43">Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.12;p7.43">(2000) define <hi rend="italic">aggregators</hi> as an intermediary between suppliers and consumers, which create travel packages according to market needs and make purchases convenient for customers. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p7.43">
<hi rend="italic">Integrators,</hi> on the other hand, take into consideration individual's needs and wants and design and deliver a product according to specific customer needs (Bowie and Paraskevas, 2006). </s>
<s n="s8.12;p7.43">
<hi rend="italic">Infomediaries</hi> provide customers with the information they need to make appropriate choices, which includes price comparisons as well as quality assessments of the suppliers (Chu <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.12;p7.43">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s10.12;p7.43">Tourist boards and price comparison engines are a good example of infomediaries. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p7.43">Internet <hi rend="italic">auction sites</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">priceline</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ebaytravel</hi> are a form of online commerce where buyers and sellers come together in a central worldwide marketplace. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p7.43">
<hi rend="italic">Alliances</hi> are cooperative relationships between different suppliers, established to accelerate the competence building process and to expand the reach and visibility of their activities (Werthner and Klein, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.43">
<s n="s1.4;p8.43">From a principal's perspective direct channel is the most cost-effective one as it enables principal to completely control price and manage the inventory. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.43">Moreover, it allows maximisation of brand value with no dilution. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.43">On the other hand, with the use of intermediaries, principal looses the control of price and its brand becomes diluted. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.43">When using aggregators as an intermediary principal's control of price is the lowest and its brand becomes highly diluted, resulting in a loss of ownership of customer (Bowie and Paraskevas, 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.43">
<s n="s1.2;p9.43">From the customer perspective electronic distribution channels allow enormous amount of information easily available and accessible at anytime from any place as well as enable customers to make reservations quickly, conveniently and possibly at a lower price comparing to conventional methods of distribution. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.43">Customers can take unlimited time for planning, virtually explore various destinations as well as evaluate what meets their travel requirements and available budget (Bowie and Paraskevas, 2006). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CHANNEL CONFLICT</head>
<p n="p10.43">
<s n="s1.4;p10.43">A general trend for horizontal and/or vertical integration can be noticed in the tourism industry. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.43">Integration, either vertical or horizontal, effectively restructures the distribution of power and adds to conflict opportunities within the tourism distribution channel (Buhalis and Laws, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.43">Horizontal integration occurs at the same level of any tourism distribution channel through merges or takeovers, enabling homogeneous companies to distribute their products and services more effectively and efficiently (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.43">Vertical integration, on the other hand, is a result of merging organizations at one level in the tourism distribution channel with members from other levels to achieve economies of scale, better cost and channel control, coordinated brand management and more bargaining power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.43">
<s n="s1.5;p11.43">As Buhalis and Laws (2001) suggest, the concepts of dependence, cooperation, power and conflict are highly relevant in tourism industry. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.43">Understandably, each member of tourism distribution channel has its own needs and wants, which are different from other members of the channel. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.43">As some of these needs are conflicting and antagonistic a certain degree of <hi rend="italic">channel conflict</hi> is unavoidable. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.43">Conflict arises generally due to the natural tendency of each member to maximize their profit margin at the cost of other members in the channel, as customers are willing to pay a fairly fixed amount for their products and services (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.43">Relationship between principals and intermediaries can be thought of a as channel conflict between competing brands as both of the actors want to "own" the customer and turn him into a loyal consumer (Bowie and Paraskevas, 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.43">
<s n="s1.2;p12.43">Nowadays consumers can easily compare different products as well as the published prices, when searching tourism Internet sites, making Internet prices transparent (Bowie and Buttle, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.43">Price wars and different pricing strategies emerge as a result, such as for example "Guaranteed Best Rate" strategy where principals ensure customers they will not find their brand priced lower on an intermediaries' web site. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MARKETING/MANAGEMENT</head>
<p n="p13.43">
<s n="s1.6;p13.43">Turban and King (2003) define customer relationship marketing/management (CRM) as a customer service approach that recognizes customers as a core of a business and focuses on building long-term relationships with them and thus adding value for both the customer and the company. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.43">In a today's highly competitive world internet can be seen as a means of providing opportunities for companies to customize their offers focusing on Web based relationship marketing. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.43">Customer trust, commitment and loyalty are core concepts in relationship marketing. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.43">According to McCole (2002) trust is a vital phenomenon in a consumer's mindset with regards to buying services online. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.43">Indeed, Reichheld and Schefter (2000) believe that in e-commerce environment customers acknowledge trust to be more important than price. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.43">Furthermore, nowadays the powerful features of new technologies, such as virtual reality or intelligent agents, can be effectively applied to provide an e-business environment enabling the formation of trust (Papadopoulou et al., 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.43">
<s n="s1.9;p14.43">Development of a strong brand is of a great importance in a today's highly competitive e-business environment. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.43">Tapscott <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.43">(2000) argue that the brand is no longer an image created through one-to-many communications. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.43">Marketers should start to think of communications as a two-way process and of the brand as a measure of relationship capital. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p14.43">Brands differentiate companies from their competitors and can increase trust between the company and the customer (Chu <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.9;p14.43">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.43">Customer retention, based on trust, can be turned into loyalty. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.43">According to Reichheld and Schefter (2000) the unique economics of e-commerce make customer loyalty more significant than ever. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p14.43">Customer loyalty is no longer just one of the many ways to increase profits but is essential for company's survival. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES</head>
<p n="p15.43">
<s n="s1.5;p15.43">The general considerations and concerns about payment, security and privacy have been brought to the forefront with trading on the Internet. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.43">In order to make the Internet a safe place for customers where they can exchange accurate information and conduct transactions, self-regulated compliance programmes that award seals to privacy-friendly web sites, such as <hi rend="italic">TRUSTe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">BBB Online</hi>, have been established. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.43">Nakra (2001) believes that privacy policies are a necessity in an e-commerce environment and should offer a clear explanation to the customer about what information is collected, for what purpose it is used, and with whom it is shared. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.43">An "opt out" option should also be available to allow visitors to forbid usage of their personal data for marketing purposes. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.43">Furthermore, customer should have an option to choose whether or not to receive cookies (Nakra, 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.43">
<s n="s1.4;p16.43">Security of transactions is critical for consumer satisfaction. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.43">According to Marcussen (1999) actual and potential Internet buyers are very concerned about the potential misuse of their credit card details. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.43">However, technology solutions, such as advanced encryption techniques and digital certificates, are gradually making the Internet safer and increasing customer confidence. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.43">Turban and King (2003) point out that special protocols, such as Secure Socket Layers (SSLs), are a necessity for companies, operating in an e-commerce environment, to secure customers' e-payments and thus enhance their satisfaction. </s>

<s n="s4.16;p32.43">Very bright colours of the Web site are not particularly attractive from the customer's perspective. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p32.43">Cosmos should consider this if targeting older customers. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p32.43">The structure of the Web site could be improved, the amount of frames and tables reduced and the line widths increased. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p32.43">There should be no bad links on the Web site. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p32.43">Cosmos should pay particular attention to navigation facilities as navigating the Web site can be rather difficult for the customer. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p32.43">On some of the Web pages there is no feature 'Home' available to enable the customer to return to Cosmos Home page, which can be rather confusing. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p32.43">Online information search capabilities are important to provide users access to the information they require easily and quickly (Adam <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s11.16;p32.43">, 1999). </s>
<s n="s12.16;p32.43">Cosmos should consider offering a search engine on its Web site. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p32.43">In terms of value adding features, some additional could be introduced, such as 'Maps' or 'Fare watcher'. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p32.43">The Web site should also be improved in terms of personality and interactivity. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p32.43">Language options should be offered and visitor's basic information together with his/her preferences stored for the future use. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p33.43">In terms of unique features, 'Fare watcher' feature could be introduced. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p33.43">However, attractions for Iceland can only be booked until the end of year 2006 (less than a month ahead), which is not very convenient from the customer perspective. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p33.43">Expedia should consider this and improve their offer by making bookings available up to six months, for example. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p39.43">Web site accounts could possibly be available not only to travel agents but to customers as well, allowing Iceland Excursions to store customers' information and preferences and keep them informed about special offers based on their preferences. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.43">
<s n="s1.4;p40.43">All of the analyzed Web sites should consider improving Web accessibility as most of them were rated average on this criterion. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p40.43">Web sites should therefore become more user-friendly for people with disabilities. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p40.43">Moreover, all of the Web sites were rated with a score 5 or lower in TrustGauge scoring chart, meaning that they were not recognized as particularly trustworthy by many users. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p40.43">As trust has become a vital antecedent for purchasing online (McCole, 2002), companies should make sure to increase trustworthiness of their Web sites. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.43">
<s n="s1.4;p41.43">Security is also of a great importance to maintain trust amongst customers. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p41.43">From the customer perspective, all of the analysed Web sites can be rated as good in terms of security, as their payment Web pages are highly encrypted and security certificates provided. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p41.43">It is important, however, for companies to make sure that once security measures are in place, an appropriate amount of content on the Web site is devoted to security issues to reassure the customer that online transactions on the web Site are safe (Chaffey, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p41.43">Expedia, Cosmos, Avis, Fosshotel, BCP and Insurefor.com devote a reasonable amount of content on their Web site to security issues; however, it could be argued that Icelandair and particularly Iceland Excursions should improve in terms of explaining and reassuring the customer that online booking through their Web sites is safe and secure. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p42.43">The assignment has analysed three different electronic distribution channels from a customer perspective. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.43">All of the evaluated Web sites have their advantages as well as disadvantages and the analyzed organizations should work towards their improvement to enhance customer satisfaction. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Vision of the future</head>
<p n="p43.43">
<s n="s1.3;p43.43">Technological developments in the future will combine more powerful technology, delivering more convergence as well as more tension in distribution channel between various actors (Bowie and Paraskevas, 2006). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p43.43">It is widely reported that consumers will be the major winners of technological developments, as they will have more choice, more interactivity as well as more personalized products to choose from (Buhalis, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p43.43">According to Bowie and Paraskevas (2006), a new electronic distribution channel, the "multigrator", will emerge with convergence of principals', intermediaries' and search engines' offer to customers. </s>
