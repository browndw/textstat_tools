<s n="s1.3;p1.24">It could be argued that the films to be analysed are all, in their own different ways, effective vehicles of propaganda. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.24">This paper will firstly seek to establish an appropriate definition of propaganda, and to judge what makes good cinema propaganda. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.24">It will then go on to examine the specific "themes" of propaganda present in <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> comparing and contrasting these portrayals and, in an attempt to establish how effective each work is as a vehicle of propaganda, examine what effect they would have had on a viewer during the Third Reich and the Weimar Republic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.4;p2.24">Richard Taylor states that "propaganda is an attempt either unconsciously or part of a systematic campaign by an individual or group holding certain beliefs or desired ends, to influence others to adopt identical attitudes." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s2.4;p2.24">It is an attempt to create a uniform system of beliefs or attitudes amongst a target audience and can be done through numerous ways be it visually, the use of the spoken word or a combination of the two. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.24">The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause however, is useless without an audience; by far the most effective means of propaganda will play on the target's emotions and will often, but not specifically, be most successful paraded "under the disguise of "information"".<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.002"/> The key to its success lies in the strength of the relationship between the subject matter and the audience. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.24">To determine whether propaganda firstly as general concept can be effective I will use the example of Nazi propaganda: towards the end of the Second World War after Hitler's defeat in his personal crusade to take Stalingrad, fanatical resistance was still being put up by the German populace, even when all appeared to be lost and "the fact that these wretches were made to go on fighting for a worthless, evil cause, in which Hitler himself no longer believed, was the lasting achievement of Nazi propaganda."<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s2.6;p3.24">The strength of propaganda in the form of film is that it can incorporate the use of the spoken word and sound with the unique power of a visual image. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.24">Bramstead views film as a "major instrument of effective propaganda because of its four specific qualities: (1) subjective emotional appeal; (2) limitation of contents; (3) possibility of using it throughout to illustrate the fighting attitude and (4) continuous and uniform repetition." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s4.6;p3.24">It is also noteworthy that the film genre would enable the crossing of boundaries of class and intellect unlike radio and newspapers respectively. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.24">The potential monotony associated with the sound of the pleonastic politician, for example, can be made much more interesting and the rhetoric more understandable when coupled with cinematic montage. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.24">The subtle propagandist should manipulate the appeal of film as an escape from reality for the masses and amalgamate art and propaganda to achieve persuasion. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p4.24">Within the three films in question certain themes of propaganda can be found such as a portrayal of economic or social imbroglio versus nationalistic pride, hope, youth, family values, sacrifice, a call for action and a portrayal of an enemy. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.24">However, before examining the leitmotifs of the films themselves, it is important to acknowledge that there are differences in the structure and intentions of the works which also determine their affectivity. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.24">Perhaps the most obvious difference to point out is the fact that <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> are Nazi propaganda whereas <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi> is Communist. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.24">The appeals in the films are therefore completely different - whilst the Nazi films appeal to the emotions of the viewer, <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi> pitches at a person's reason. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.24">However, <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> differ from <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> in that they are under the pretence of being merely narrative. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.24">Both do deal with myths but whilst <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi> is stylised and very much typical of Brechtian irony, <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> is portrayed as straight realism. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.24">
<hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> is very much staged reality in that whilst it is a documentary most of all the events are staged for the camera - indeed the podiums and stages in the film were constructed with enough space for the camera tracks to run in front of them: "the preparations for the Party Convention were made in connection with preparations for the camera work." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s8.9;p4.24">It is also significant to note that the events of the Nuremburg Rally are not chronological in the film which shows that it cannot be a true objective documentary and is, in reality, Riefenstahl manipulating the viewer and the events through editing. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.24">For example Hitler addressing the S.A. was actually on 9 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> September 1934 whereas in the film it comes as the eleventh sequence and after the Review of the Army which was actually on September 10 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>. </s>

<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.4;p5.24">The structural difference between the two Nazi films can almost be personified using the models of Hitler and Goebbels. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.24">Hitler's basic tenet of effective propaganda was that it "must be limited to very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public knows what you mean." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s3.4;p5.24">This comes into play in <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.24">Goebbels, however, was much more interested in a covert approach and thought that politics and art "could be subtly mixed"<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.008"/> as seen in <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi>. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.9;p6.24">Perhaps the focus of Riefenstahl's work, as a propaganda tool, in <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willlens</hi> is the depiction of national pride. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.24">Indeed the film is a portrayal of might of the Nazi machine. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.24">The very title, which was devised by Hitler himself, is significant as it stresses not only the triumphant presence of the Nazis but also includes the 'will' of the nation: "The strength of the nation...[is] seen to lie in the submergence of the individual will in the will of the nation".<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.009"/> This concept of nationality is depicted in the symbols of National Socialism; namely the swastika and the eagle, both of which are dominant features throughout the film. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.24">The first shot in the film is of the Nazi eagle coupled appropriately with Wagnerian style orchestral music by Herbert Windt. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.24">This serves two purposes: firstly the music serves to emphasise the titles by Ruttmann which are hard hitting and this creates the opening sequence to be one of considerable drama. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.24">This concept matches David Hinton's belief that "Windt's music plays a key role in forming the audience response to the titles. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.24">Beginning with sorrowful, mournful notes that underline the message of the titles." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s8.9;p6.24">Secondly, Windt's music is chosen in particular to underline the change in tone which is to be introduced towards the next sequence in the film. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.24">The mood becomes slightly more positive and just as the titles describe the Reich as the "<hi rend="italic">der deutschen Wiedergeburht</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.011"/> the music reflects this and becomes much more subdued. </s>

<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.4;p7.24">The constant images of the two Nazi symbols serve not only to remind the viewer of the presence of Nazism but also to link the two entities of the party and the nation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.24">One particular example is when Hitler addresses the S.A. to reassure them after the Röhm purge on 30 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> June 1934 where at one point there is a shot which is completely filled with flags: "nothing can be seen but the flags, which move up, down and forward as if they have a mind of their own." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s3.4;p7.24">This is an effective propaganda technique as the viewer is mesmerised by not only the number of flags by the movement they make, drawing them further into the film and at the same time further towards National Socialism. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.24">The film also ends with S.A. men juxtaposed on the image of a swastika and the fact that the film begins and finishes with Nazi images is significant as they convey a great sense of national pride to the viewer. </s>

</note>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.5;p8.24">This is similar to <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> which also ends with the image of the flag and is coupled with the triumphant singing of "<hi rend="italic">Unsere Fahne flatter uns voran</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.24">Another similarity between the two Nazi films is the presence of order and pride associated with National Socialism and this is perhaps best seen through the behaviour and dress of the Hitler Jugend (HJ). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.24">As in <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> the male Nazis are, in almost every scene, shot in uniform with a swastika on their arm. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.24">This powerful technique again serves as a constant reminder of the presence of the party and gives the aura of all men proud to fight for Germany, taking her into the future and avenging the Treaty of Versailles. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.24">The Nazis in <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> are again often shot with flags of the swastika which again is significant as a propaganda tool as it "symbolises the party program, it is the visual epitome of Nazi ideology"<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.014"/> which the young boys in <hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> "understand so well." <ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.015"/> </s>

<s n="s1.10;p9.24">In <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi>, however, in direct contrast to the tactics of Riefenstahl and Hans Steinhoff, Brecht appeals to the reason not the emotion of the viewer and therefore uses negative images in order to depict the Weimar Republic such as unemployment, depression, abortion and suicide. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p9.24">The first few shots of the film are a montage of newspaper headlines, juxtaposed before the images become specifically the front pages. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p9.24">This would highlight the fact that the situation was becoming increasingly worrying - this is symbolised by the headlines becoming more dramatic and more dominating on the front pages. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p9.24">This montage is coupled with rapid staccato music and this erraticism mirrors the economic and social problems of the time. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p9.24">We see immediately the unemployment figures rising until one headline reads that there are now almost "<hi rend="italic">fünf Millionen Arbeitslose</hi>." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.016"/>
<s n="s6.10;p9.24">The issue of unemployment continues when we see the mass of unemployed people scrambling to get hold of a newspaper to see if there are any jobs; they are of course unsuccessful and the camera focuses on the faces of the young men to illustrate their resigned ness. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p9.24">One of the most powerful scenes in the film is that of the hunt of the boys for jobs on their bicycles. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.24">The use of close-ups here is particularly interesting; the focus is on the boys' feet and the pedals of the bike moving faster and faster. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p9.24">The music highlights the desperate attempt to search for work and it seems that the faster they pedal the more in vain their quest becomes. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p9.24">The power and effect this image would have on a Weimar audience would be especially strong as Brecht is dealing here with reality and the depression that Germany suffered from 1929 onwards. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.24">It is not only unemployment which Brecht uses to illustrate his dissatisfaction with the Weimar system, many other negative images associated with industry and housing are also prominent throughout the film. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.24">All shots of factories in the film are with the camera looking up at black, dirty intimidating buildings - often with large gates preventing the job seekers from entering. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.24">The fact that the Bönike family has to live in tents because they have been evicted despite Anni's best efforts - all of which are appropriately in vain - further portrays the social problems associated with Germany in the early 1930s. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.24">This technique of Brecht depicting the difficulties of an individual is one of the main differences in propaganda techniques between <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi> and the two Nazi films. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.24">
<s n="s1.9;p11.24">Although <hi rend="italic">Kuhle</hi> Wampe takes an opposing stance as far as the theme of national pride is concerned, there are glimpses in the film of solidarity and unity. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p11.24">One depiction of this is through the sports festival in which the team members are working together for a common objective. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p11.24">This however, as noticed by Marc Silberman serves predominantly to highlight the censorship which is "camouflaged behind the relatively harmless allegory of mass sports races." <ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.017"/>Another important issue of solidarity in Brecht's film is the presence of the <hi rend="italic">Solidaritätslied</hi> and the workers are encouraged to move "<hi rend="italic">Forwärts und nicht vergessen, die Solidarität</hi>." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061f-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s4.9;p11.24">When the song is sung the workers are moving in unison towards their goal but in comparison to the geometric patterns of the masses in <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> they are nowhere near as effective. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p11.24">Whereas the workers in <hi rend="italic">Kuhle Wampe</hi> appear to be slightly unsettled in their movement, the patterns of people at Nuremburg are mesmeric. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p11.24">Perhaps the best example to note is at the very beginning of the film where the mobility of Riefenstahl's camera work from the air coupled with the dreamy music of <hi rend="italic">Das Horst Wessel Lied</hi> (the Nazi anthem) emphasizes the order of the Nazi mass as it moves in unison, snakelike on the streets below. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p11.24">There are also many static scenes of the mass in <hi rend="italic">Triumph des Willens</hi> and Riefenstahl manipulates these through the movement of the camera to draw the viewer into the assemblage: "If the subject didn't move, then the camera had to be mobile." </s>
<s n="s8.9;p11.24">One such example is when Hitler S.A. Chief Lutze and S.S. Chief Himmler walk down the aisle between thousands of S.A. men towards the War Memorial, the cameras here were installed on flagpoles to emphasise the enormity of the occasion. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p11.24">
<hi rend="italic">Hitlerjunge Quex</hi> includes this theme of motion as a metaphoric depiction of the enemy, namely the Communists; one such example is at the fairground where the circular motion hints perhaps that they are not progressing in stark contrast to the linear advancement associated with the Nazis. </s>
