<s n="s1.4;p1.15">The aim of this experiment was to examine the induction of β-galactosidase in <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> at different temperatures. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.15">This was done by assaying for enzyme activity by addition of toluene and oNPG to samples of <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.15">The results show that induction does not occur at 15°C due to decreased enzyme activity. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.15">Induction occurs fully at 30°C and 37°C, as this is the optimum range for the enzyme, and translation and transcription occur. </s>
</p>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.7;p2.15">The <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> operon encodes three enzymes <hi rend="sup">1</hi> required for lactose degradation: β-galactosidase, lactose permease and thiogalactoside transacetylase <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.15">These genes are adjacent to each other in the operon. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.15">Before these genes there is a region which regulates the lactose metabolic genes: this region contains the regulator, promoter and operator. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.15">The regulator gene encodes a repressor protein which can bind to the operator site <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.15">This repressor is a tetrameric protein. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.15">The promoter contains a binding site for RNA polymerase, and directs the polymerase towards the correct transcription initiation site. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.15">In addition to this promoter in the operon, a second promoter is present in front of the regulator gene, which drives the synthesis of the regulator. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.4;p3.15">The primary carbon source of <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> is glucose, but other carbon sources, such as lactose (a sugar present in milk) can be metabolised using the genes of the <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> operon. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.15">In the absence of lactose, the transcription of the lac structural genes is blocked by the repressor. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.15">The <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> repressor binds DNA by inserting an α-helix into the major groove of DNA. The edges of the base pairs and the phosphodiester backbone also make contact with the repressor. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.15">Very little, if any, β-galactosidase, permease or transacetylase is produced. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.5;p4.15">When lactose is present it is converted to allolactose, a combination of galactose and glucose with an α-1,6 linkage, which is the correct inducer of the operon. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.15">Allolactose binds in the centre of the large domain in each monomer in the <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> operon and the repressor's affinity for operator DNA is reduced. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.15">This is done by a conformational change being induced in the interface with the DNA-binding domains. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.15">The domains cannot easily contact DNA now, which leads to the DNA-binding affinity being reduced dramatically. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.15">The proteins encoded by the structural gene are transcribed, and lactose is utilised. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.4;p5.15">DNA-binding proteins can stimulate transcription. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.15">An example is the catabolite activator protein (CAP), or the cAMP response protein (CRP). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.15">When CAP is bound to cAMP, the transcription of lactose and arabinose catabolising genes is stimulated. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.15">The CAP-cAMP complex stimulates the initiation of transcription by a factor of 50. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.15">
<s n="s1.2;p6.15">Within the laboratory, induction can be achieved by adding iso-propylthiogalactoside (IPTG), as IPTG is not catabolised by the cell and does not act as a carbon source, so it is described as a 'gratuitous' inducer. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.15">This is because, within the laboratory, the cells can be grown in a defined medium with glycerol as the carbon source: the expression of the <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> operon is neither induced nor repressed. </s>

<p n="p10.15">
<s n="s1.4;p10.15">Figure 1 shows that for all four temperatures, the amount of o-nitrophenol (oNP) released in nM increases from zero. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.15">For 37°C, the amount of oNP released increases from 0nM to 155.9nM over 30 minutes, and then the amount released plateaus and remains constant at 157.42nM. For 30°C, the amount of oNP released increases from 0nM to 197.23nM over 30 minutes, and then remains constant for the remaining 20 minutes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.15">At 25°C, the amount of oNP released increases from 0nM to 94.07nM at 50 minutes, and then remains constant at 95.36. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.15">At 15°C, the amount of oNP released was 0nM for 35 minutes, until the amount released increased to 13.75 at 60 minutes, an increase of 36.4%. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p11.15">At 15°C leaky repression occurs. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.15">No induction occurs at this temperature, so translation and transcription also do not occur. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.15">At this temperature a little oNP is released, although there is a slight increase between 40 and 60 minutes (see Figure 1), indicating that the induction of β-galactosidase does not occur. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.15">This is due to the decreased enzyme activity as the enzyme and substrate has little kinetic energy. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.15">The release of a little oNP must therefore be due to leaky repression of the genes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.15">
<s n="s1.4;p12.15">At 25°C, little oNP is released (see Figure 1), indicating that the β-galactosidase gene is not fully induced at this temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.15">Due to the low temperature, translation and transcription occur at a low rate due to the low temperature, which allows product inhibition to occur very rapidly. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.15">The rate of β-galactosidase synthesis equals the rate of destruction, so the activity remains at a constant rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.15">The plateau at this temperature, and also for 30°C and 37°C, is caused by product inhibition of β-galactosidase, which creates the constant level. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.15">
<s n="s1.4;p13.15">The results from 30°C and 37°C are very similar: at these temperatures, induction of β-galactosidase occurs, and this is the optimum temperature for the enzyme. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.15">The increase in the release of oNP (see Figure 1) indicates the translation and transcription are occurring at a high rate, and that β-galactosidase synthesis is greater than the rate of destruction. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.15">The turnover number is high at these temperatures. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.15">The plateau, as explained above, is due to product inhibition. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.15">
<s n="s1.2;p14.15">The amount of oNP released at 37°C is less at 25 minutes and onwards, than at 30°C. This is because at 37°C, the enzyme starts to thermally denature and becomes unstable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.15">Therefore, fewer enzymes (β-galactosidase) will be available, and transcription and translation will slow down. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.15">
<s n="s1.4;p15.15">The reason for the plateau at different levels of oNP may be due to a ratio between the amount of β-galactosidase and product. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.15">When the amount of product reaches a certain level in relation to the enzyme, the product inhibits the enzyme and production plateaus. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.15">There is a more rapid rate of induction for 37°C, due to the high temperature, which causes a rapid build up and a lower plateau. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.15">Therefore, product inhibition occurs more quickly. </s>
