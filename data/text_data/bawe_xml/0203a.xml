<s n="s1.14;p10.91">
<name type="other"/> is a right handed lady indicating that her dominant hemisphere (i.e. that which controls language and mathematical function) is on the left. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p10.91">From the history it appears that <name type="other"/> is suffering from a type of dysphasia. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p10.91">Dysphasia is an acquired loss of production or comprehension of spoken and/or written language secondary to brain damage. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p10.91">There are two main types of dysphasia - Expressive or Receptive. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p10.91">Expressive dysphasia is characterised by non-fluent speech produced with effort and frustration. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p10.91">Signs to look for on examination include malformed words and impaired reading and writing. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p10.91">Comprehension is intact, patients understand questions and attempt to convey meaningful answers. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p10.91">There may be co existing right arm and facial weakness. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p10.91">It is caused by a lesion in the posterior part of the dominant third frontal gyrus (Brocas area). </s>
<s n="s10.14;p10.91">Receptive dysphasia is characterised by empty, fluent speech. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p10.91">The patient is oblivious of any errors, reading writing and comprehension are impaired. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p10.91">It is caused by a lesion in the posterior part of the first temporal gyrus (Wernickes area). </s>
<s n="s13.14;p10.91">The examination will therefore need to differentiate between the two types of dysphasia. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p10.91">The motor system will also need to be examined for any evidence of coexisting weakness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.91">
<s n="s1.6;p11.91">Dysphasia may develop as a result of vascular, neoplastic, traumatic, infective or degenerative disease of the cerebrum. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.91">The sudden onset of <name type="other"/>'s initial episode of dysphasia in <name type="date"/> 2005 would indicate a vascular cause and this is supported by the diagnosis of a left sided CVA. However, the lack of associated weakness indicates that this was not a normal infarct affecting the motor cortex. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.91">Vascular lesions also tend to improve with time which does not fit with <name type="other"/>'s history as her dysphasia has been getting progressively worse. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.91">Cardiovascular examination will therefore be important especially blood pressure, arrhythmias and carotid bruits which may all indicate risk factors for stroke. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.91">The recurrent episodes of dysphasia could be due to a vascular cause such as transient ischaemic attacks which are temporarily reducing the blood supply to the region of brain controlling language. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.91">There has been no history of head trauma to indicate this as a relevant cause of the dysphasia. <name type="other"/> is keen to have a diagnosis for her condition as she has had no symptoms apart from those mentioned and says that she feels well in herself. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.91">
<s n="s1.7;p12.91">The episodes have increased in frequency since <name type="date"/> and have become progressively worse - this would indicate an expanding brain lesion. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p12.91">A space occupying lesion will lead to raised intracranial pressure depending on the size of the lesion. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p12.91">Signs of raised intracranial pressure include nausea and vomiting, headaches (often worse in the morning) and papilloedema, none of which <name type="other"/> reported in her history. <name type="other"/> didn't report any weight loss a sign associated with neoplasms. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p12.91">If the lesion is a neoplasm, the speed of onset of symptoms suggest a malignant rather than a benign neoplasm. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p12.91">Intracranial tumours are classified according to their tissue of origin with the most common group of primary brain tumours being gliomas. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p12.91">This group contains astrocytomas, glioblastoma multiforme, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p12.91">They commonly occur in the frontal, parietal or temporal lobe. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.91">
<s n="s1.3;p13.91">Likely diagnosis at this stage would point to either a neoplasm in <name type="other"/> dominant hemisphere. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.91">Another possible diagnosis could be recurrent TIA's due to e.g. carotid artery stenosis or valvular dysfunction as <name type="other"/> recalled the possibility that she had had rheumatic fever as a child. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.91">However from the history, <name type="other"/> does not appear to have any risk factors for atherosclerosis. </s>

<p n="p82.91">
<s n="s1.5;p82.91">Patients with presumed primary brain tumours have two surgical management options - biopsy or resection. <name type="other"/> was not displaying any signs of increased intracranial pressure and so resection of the tumour was not essential. </s>

<p n="p83.91">
<s n="s1.8;p83.91">Treatment with chemotherapy has been disappointing as there is difficulty in finding a drug which will cross the blood brain barrier [1]. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p83.91">The Medical Research Council found no significant benefit in overall survival when evaluating the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma [4]. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p83.91">However, recent RCT studies by the EORTC (European organisation for research and treatment of cancer) showed a statistically significant benefit to median survival of treating patients with radiotherapy and Temozolomide compared to radiotherapy alone [4]. </s>
