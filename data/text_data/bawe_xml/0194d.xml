<s n="s1.2;p53.55">Is an umbrella term for ischaemic cardiac chest pain of recent origin and includes: unstable angina, NSTEMI, or an acute, evolving or recent MI. The latter has to show features of varying levels of cardiac markers, as well as the patient exhibiting either; ischaemic symptoms, development of pathological Q waves on the ECG, ischaemic ECG changes e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p53.55">ST elevation or depression or following coronary artery intervention such as an angiogram/plasty [4,5,6,7]. </s>

<p n="p54.55">
<s n="s1.3;p54.55">These various events occur due to the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombosis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p54.55">A plaque may rupture and re-seal several times causing recurrent episodes of pain. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p54.55">The severity and type of the acute coronary syndrome will be determined by the severity and duration of the occlusion, the vessel affected and the presence of collateral blood supply [2,3]. </s>
