<s n="s2.2;p1.15">Yet these reformists have been described both as the 'left-wing of the Reformation', as asserted by Roland Bainton, and as 'the Bolsheviks of the Reformation', as postulated by Preserved Smith, representing the variations in historical opinion. <ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p2.15">However, in the 1940s Harold Bender observed that there were two strands of Anabaptism present in the early sixteenth-century across Germany, Switzerland, Holland and Austria; on one hand there existed 'original evangelical and constructive Anabaptism...and the various mystical, spiritualistic, revolutionary...groups on the other." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s2.2;p2.15">In this analysis the former description highlights the most accurate form of Anabaptism, in which the most important groups were the Swiss Brethren, the Hutterites, the Thuringian Anabaptists, and various factions shaped under the leaderships of Pilgram Marpeck, Hans Hut and George Schnabel. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.15">The Anabaptists were comprised of those who were considered 'people with ideals, good intentions, commitment and a readiness for martyrdom, but also powerless people, temporisers, failures, cantankerous and obstinate people." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s2.7;p3.15">This conflict in the interpretation of who Anabaptists were highlights how the movement is surveyed in differing ways according to the theological perspective of the historian. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.15">For example, Protestants considered the sect to be composed of fanatic rebels, and contemporary Catholic sympathisers regarded the birth of Anabaptism to be the radical consequence of Luther's Reformation. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.15">Such denominational bias has shaped and dominated the history of Anabaptism. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.15">Yet recent research has shown that Anabaptism can be seen as a culmination of the Reformation that developed from a number of roots in the sixteenth-century. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.15">It did not derive from Lutheran Reformation alone, but also from Huldrych Zwingli's Reformation in Switzerland, Thomas Müntzer's notorious Radical Reformation in Germany and the influential ideas of Melchior Hoffman in Strasbourg. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.15">These existing reform movements whetted the appetites for further transformations as radicals became disillusioned with the compromises of existing authorities and hence created their own complex and diverse movement, bent upon restitution. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.15">In terms of the threat presented by Anabaptism to established authority in the sixteenth-century, that of both the State and the Church must be taken into consideration, as must the severity of any threat they posed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.15">It is significant that the threat of Anabaptism was not initially realised by the established powers. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.15">Consequently 'at the outset it was tolerated by the authorities and its early progress was therefore rapid'<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.004"/>, especially as it garnered support among peasants who were equally disgruntled with established authorities. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.15">Anabaptists' prime rejection of what they saw as the wickedness of the world, deemed to be embodied by the Church and government, presented a serious threat to these authorities. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.15">However, it was principally with the rupture of Anabaptists from mainstream reformist ideology that such a threat became recognisable, specifically with regard to the Church. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.15">As the leaders of the movement realised that any hope of steering the Reformation in the direction they desired had vanished, they went on to envisage a complete separation and rigorously marked themselves off from the Church, rather than attempting to purify and reform the existing Christianity. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.15">This schism represented how the Anabaptist vision went to further extremes, compared to the moderate ideology of Luther, because it gave the existing Reformation movement 'body and form, and set out to achieve it in actual experience." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.6;p5.15">Anabaptists did not accept the Church system that was being fashioned under the existing reformers and sought to create their own renewed religion; 'what emerged piecemeal during the 1520s was a coherent theological vision which underpinned an ambitious, and unique, plan for the reform of the church." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s6.6;p5.15">This vision presented a serious threat to established authority in the religious sphere, as it was to rise against many existing principles endorsed by such authorities, and was to provoke a widespread climate of anti-clericalism throughout the population. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.15">As a result of this vision, Anabaptism presented a threat to the established religious authorities. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.15">For instance, their focus on the Church related neither to the Catholic institution, nor the Lutheran belief in the divine word, but to a brotherhood in which the true Christian ideal was satisfied, thus going against established authorities. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.15">In contrast to the traditional optimism of Catholics and their hope for redemption, Anabaptists were pessimistic and saw the suffering of the existing Church as irreparable and attacked its iconoclasm and presentation of a false religion. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.15">Anabaptists followed the path of Zwingli, who had 'hammered away at the contrast between the harsh and sordid reality of daily life and the promises of Scripture'<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.008"/>, in their renunciation of the traditional religion. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.15">The established Church authorities saw this as tantamount to a rejection of the faith, which was furthered by the Anabaptist rejection of the importance of the Mass and the Bible. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.15">This belief stemmed from the Anabaptist ideal that baptism was a regeneration of faith and necessary for the admission into God's Church. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.15">By practicing infant baptism the established Church were considered, by the Anabaptists, to have destroyed their unity with New Testament teachings. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.15">The threat to religious authority can be considered serious because the Anabaptists 'were never weary of denouncing infant baptism as 'the Pope's first and highest abomination', and as a device of Satan for the corruption of Christ'<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.009"/>, and in this sustained attack on the existing method of baptism they threatened the religious foundations on which this practice was based. </s>

<s n="s1.13;p9.15">The Seven Articles in the Schleitheim Confession of February 1527, formulated by Michael Sattler of the Swiss Brethren, were the first systematic statement of Anabaptism and was thus considered an apocalyptic document. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p9.15">Arnold Snyder identified this Confession with the 'crystallisation point for the Swiss movement'<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.010"/>, as it was one of the first known attempts to unite the disagreeing factions of Anabaptism. </s>

<s n="s4.13;p9.15">In the Schleitheim Confession, Anabaptists presented a united front, openly criticised the cooperation between the Reformed Churches and secular authorities, and disputed the character of government Yet 'Anabaptist ideas on the question of government were too varied to be neatly summed up by the formulaic 'separation of Church and government''<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.011"/> as a result of the diversity of opinions across the sects. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p9.15">Nevertheless, the Schleitheim Confession projected Anabaptists into the limelight in showing they were prepared to take an uncompromising stand in political matters. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p9.15">In this they went much further than previous reformers who had 'proved reluctant to cut the close bonds which existed between the Church and Government." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s7.13;p9.15">Anabaptists presented a serious threat to government authority as they scrupulously denied that Christians should dispense justice or plead cases before secular courts because 'it was not the place of the magistrates to judge in matters of faith; that was for God alone." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s8.13;p9.15">Neither would Anabaptists partake in military service or carry arms; 'they suffered imprisonment and death rather than bear arms." </s>

<s n="s9.13;p9.15">They also refused to swear oaths, as they would be swearing their 'loyalty and obedience to a government which persecuted and executed Christians." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s10.13;p9.15">Furthermore, they refused to hold a government office because it 'often required the infliction of capital punishment, and to kill was, under no circumstances, permissible to a Christian'<ref target="BAWE_0129f-ftnote.016"/>, and went against their fundamental principles. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p9.15">Anabaptism therefore threatened disharmony within the established government authorities as it pointed out its chief limitation: that it was not able to live up to the divine perfection of God. </s>
