<p n="p9.70">
<s n="s1.2;p9.70">The derivation of the CAPM starts by assuming that all assets are stochastic and follow a normal distribution. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.70">The mean value is a measure of location and the variance <hi rend="sup">2</hi> is a measure of dispersion. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p10.70">The first important component of the CAPM is referred to as the Capital Market Line (CML). </s>

<p n="p14.70">
