<s n="s1.5;p3.129">It is no doubt that the primary objective of one company is making profits. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.129">Initially, we decided on two objectives, financially focused and customer focused, one was got maximum profit in twelve weeks; another was met customers needs completely. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.129">At a glance on these objectives, they were not clear, immeasurable and contradictory. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.129">Because if we wish to maximize our profits, it means that we have to take some actions to control all kinds of cost, such as reduction of level of inventory which may lead to fail to satisfy customers demand. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.129">Taking into account the conditions in this game that a penalty is 12% of the sales value of under-delivered goods and the cost of holding inventory is only 0.5% of the value for both raw materials and finished goods, we rebuilt our objectives that: get 30% ROCE (return on capital employed) in twelve weeks in the precondition that totally satisfy customers' needs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.129">
<s n="s1.2;p4.129">There are two measurement indicators to assess our performance and show if we have achieved the objectives which we had decided before. </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.129">
<s n="s1.1;p11.129">Before the beginning of game level one, we should consider customers' demand, breakeven point of each shift and capacity. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.129">
<s n="s1.1;p12.129">Demand pattern </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.129">
<s n="s1.4;p13.129">The study of historical data pointed out that the demand of STD model varied greatly from 1845 units/week at the lowest to 1491 7units/week at the highest. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.129">Meanwhile, there was a peak demand every four or five weeks. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.129">This year, average sales of first twelve weeks were 6229 units/week compared to 5371 last year, increased by approximately 15%. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.129">So, we forecasted this year aggregated demand can be expected to be 5371*15%=6179 units/week. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.129">
<s n="s1.1;p14.129">Breakeven points </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.129">
<s n="s1.3;p15.129">Next, we needed to decide how many products we should sell to cover all costs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.129">As to day shift, basic cost=fixed cost + day shift semi-fixed cost=37k+23k =60k, contribution/unit = selling price - variable costs = £45-(£1 5+£1 0) =£20, so the breakeven point=basic costs/contribution=3000units. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.129">Accordingly, we can get the breakeven points of night shift, Saturday shift and evening shift, the numbers were 1512, 715 and 163 respectively. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.129">
<s n="s1.1;p16.129">Capacity planning </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.129">
<s n="s1.2;p17.129">Our maximum capacity is 8350units/week, which can not meet the highest demand. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.129">So we have to produce more products when the market demand is lower and hold high level of finished goods inventory as a butter to meet the peak demand in the future. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.129">
<s n="s1.1;p18.129">In game level one, our strategy was successful as a result of low unit cost, no penalty and low raw material stock holding cost. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="underlined">Change in game level two</head>
<p n="p19.129">
<s n="s1.8;p19.129">In game level two, we decided to change our strategy slightly to raise higher level of inventory and add night shift, because suppliers became less reliable, and production lost had to be consider due to scrap, rework and machine down time. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p19.129">At the end of game level two, there were two problems raised. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p19.129">One was that our unit cost was almost as high as price we sold, reached to £43.06/unit which made our company unprofitable. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p19.129">Through analysis, there were two reasons which led to this result, first reason was production lost which was uncontrollable factor, and second was adding of night shift which was controllable factor. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p19.129">In fact, we only produced average 1500 units weekly by night shift in this four weeks, it can be totally replaced by Saturday shift plus evening shift which were more inexpensive and flexible. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p19.129">Another problem was stock value. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p19.129">In week 18, the value of stock was £595799, which meant that we not only spent much money for inventory cost, but also lost interests that we can earn from deposit account. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p19.129">So, our strategy in game level two was not successful, we lost a lot of money, although we met all customers' requirement. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="underlined">Change in game level three</head>
<p n="p20.129">
<s n="s1.5;p20.129">In game level three, the game introduced a new product XL model, and the initial demand for the new product was estimated to be about half of that for the standard model, approximately 31 00units/week. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.129">Although capacity-related costs had changed a little, it is necessary to adding nigh shift now, because the average total demand increased to 9300units/week. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.129">We also decided to adjust inventory level to adequate level, so we can achieve our financially focused objective. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.129">Unfortunately, a penalty occurred at week 24 with a small volume of 64 under-delivered XL model units as a result of wrong forecasting and low inventory. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p20.129">Obviously, the changes of strategy for level three were not fully successful. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.129">
<s n="s1.2;p21.129">Overall, our strategy was successful, but not fully. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.129">By the end of week 24, we meet our financial focused objective, but fail to our customer focused objective due to once penalty.. </s>

<p n="p35.129">
<s n="s1.1;p35.129">Also, the formula looks like this: Qo = EOQ=(2CoD/Ch)＾ 1/2 which is the result of minimizing total variable cost. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.129">
<s n="s1.1;p36.129">If we know the total demand for a period of time (D), the total holding cost/item in the period of time (Ch) and the total costs of placing an order (Co), we can get the optimal order quantities (Qo). </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0168a-fig.001">
<head>Figure 1-1 graphical representation of the economic order quantity EOQ</head>
</figure>
<p n="p37.129">
<s n="s1.4;p37.129">What the figure 1-1 shows is that when value of order quantity is low, the inventory holding costs are low, but order costs are very high because of high frequency of placing orders to meet needs; as order quantity increase, holding cost grow but order costs decline. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p37.129">Before the point of EOQ, the decrease of order costs is greater than the increase of holding costs, so total cost fall. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p37.129">However, after EOQ point, the situation is reverse, the decrease of order costs is less than the increase of holding costs, so the total cost starts to increase. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.129">EOQ is the point where the total cost is the lowest. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.129">
<s n="s1.3;p38.129">According to Pareto's theory, the inventory items can split into three categories labelled A, B and C where A items constitute 20% of the volume and 80% of the money, B items represent 30% of the volume and 15% of the money and finally C items represent 50% and 5% respectively [2]. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.129">EOQ model pays attention on controlling inventory of class A because of the high value. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.129">In order to improve inventory control and reduce costs, EOQ indicates that class A should be small order quantity and place an order very frequently, while class C should be large order quantity with little frequency of placing orders. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.129">
<s n="s1.3;p39.129">In reality, EOQ ignores the effect of labour cost and machine cost. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p39.129">For example, when the numbers of orders increase, we have to add people to manage orders which increase labour cost. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p39.129">So a trade-off should be considered when we apply EOQ model. </s>

<p n="p41.129">
<s n="s1.1;p41.129">In the period from thirteenth week to twenty-fourth week this year, the total demand for standard model is about Df= average weekly demand*12= 61 79*12=74148units. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p42.129">The demands of three kind of raw materials are determined by finished goods demand and production lost. </s>

</p>
<p n="p43.129">
<s n="s1.2;p43.129">Because our strategy in game is production smoothing, which means we keep stable capacity of approximately 6500units/week. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p43.129">So, former order quantity q for each raw material is about 6500units/week. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.129">
<s n="s1.2;p44.129">Because the cost of holding inventory per week is estimated to be 0.5% of the value of raw materials, the twelve weeks holding cost is 6% of the value. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p118.129">One of problems led by adding a new shift is that shift schedule problem. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p118.129">Every week, operation manager has to determine which type of products and how many should be produced during the different shift. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p118.129">He also needs to have trade-off between shift costs and service levels. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p118.129">Adding an additional shift will make the decision process become more complicated. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">c) Answer</head>
<p n="p119.129">
<s n="s1.6;p119.129">In this company, the machinery is multi-purpose and production rates vary greatly. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p119.129">Machine reliability and set up time are variable from 1% and 30 minutes to 30% and 24hours respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p119.129">Utilization of machines is very low. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p119.129">Obviously, this is a traditional manufacturer. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p119.129">An additional shift is only a short-term method to increase capacity. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p119.129">Some long-term methods should be introduced in order to improve productivity and completely meet the rapid growth of customers' needs. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined bold">Option 1: Improve the exist procedure</head>
<p n="p120.129">
<s n="s1.6;p120.129">Although multi-purpose machines are available for a range of products and the breakdown of a particular machine will not halt an entire process and work can be transferred to other machines, they increase the movements of raw materials workers. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p120.129">The product can not move in sequence as well, because tooling has to be replaced between two types of products. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p120.129">The set up time is a great waste. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p120.129">So, rearranging the layout into cell layout is a good choice. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p120.129">In cell layout, machines are grouped and dedicated to a particular family of product [9]. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p120.129">Workcell is the heart of lean manufacture, and it can reduce lead time, simply material flow, and increase productivity greatly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p121.129">
<s n="s1.1;p121.129">The disadvantage of this method is that the cost of transformation is not inexpensive, company should pay attention to its budget, and otherwise it may get into financial problem. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined bold">Option 2: Train employees</head>
<p n="p122.129">
<s n="s1.3;p122.129">It is a feasible and cheap way to improve productivity and increase capacity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p122.129">Workers should own adequate skill for what they are in charge, poor skills will affect the whole production process as a bottleneck. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p122.129">As a result, the productivity would decrease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p123.129">
<s n="s1.3;p123.129">Company can offer some on-job training course in which staffs can reach an optimum level of skill and knowledge in their tasks. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p123.129">Indeed, high skilled employees form the backbone of a company, and they usually do big contributions to the growth of productivity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p123.129">For example, high skilled machinist can maintain machines keeping stable and high reliability. </s>
</p>
<p n="p124.129">
<s n="s1.1;p124.129">The problem of this method is that if an employee resigns, company will lose their training expenditure and cultivate a professional for its competitor. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined bold">Option 3: Improve quality</head>
<p n="p125.129">
<s n="s1.1;p125.129">Rework, scrap and all kinds of defects have negative effect in productivity, so quality improvement is a significant method for increasing production capacity. we can employ some advanced quality control methods such as six sigma. </s>
</p>
<p n="p126.129">
<s n="s1.2;p126.129">Six sigma project aims to continually improve process quality and reduce defects which include five steps: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p126.129">A set of tools (charter, TMAP, process map, measurement system evaluation, VOP, etc.) can be used to guarantee the successful implementation of DMAIC. Project team will be responsible for the improvement of quality and control [10]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p127.129">
<s n="s1.2;p127.129">Many black belts and green belts which are a group of peoples, who are responsible for six sigma project, are required during the implementation of project. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p127.129">So, it is essential to combine six sigma and employee training plan. </s>
</p>
</div3>

<head rend="underlined bold">Option 4: Incentive scheme </head>
<p n="p128.129">
<s n="s1.2;p128.129">Recognition and reward system is an important method to improve performance and productivity. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p128.129">It should be quick, known, understandable and attainable as well as compatible with job measurements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p129.129">
<s n="s1.1;p129.129">If a reward system is unfair and unrealistic, it will have a negative effect on employees. </s>
