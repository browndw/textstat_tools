<s n="s3.3;p28.38">The design of the holding section for a desired residence time must therefore take into account that the flow rate within it will be greater than the inlet product flow rate. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p29.38">Cooling of the product may be by any indirect heat exchanger that is suitable to the product characteristics. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p30.38">The thermal efficiency of a direct heating system may be increased by indirect regenerative heating before the product is mixed with steam; this may be achieved by heat transfer from the outgoing product is mixed with steam; this may be achieved by heat transfer from the outgoing product after the expansion cooling stage, by recovery of heat from the water vapour liberated in the expansion, or by using the condenser cooling water on the exit from the condenser, when it has been heated. </s>

<p n="p35.38">
<s n="s1.3;p35.38">Direct heating systems need more pumps than indirect systems. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p35.38">It needs three product pumps of different types, as well as a homogeniser if the product requires it, and a vacuum pump for the removal of the non condensable gases from the condenser. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p35.38">Only a single pump may be needed with an indirect system, together with a homogeniser. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.38">
<s n="s1.1;p36.38">At the stage of flash cooling, the temperature and the pressure of the process should adequately controlled to avoid dilution or concentration of the product due to removal of quantity of water less or more, respectively, than the one of the steam which has been condensed at the previous stage. </s>

</p>
<p n="p38.38">
<s n="s1.3;p38.38">Finally, as far as the processing of milk is concerned, when milk is heated above 85°C there is production of low molecular weight compounds like H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>S, CH <hi rend="sub">3</hi>, SH which can give unacceptable taste. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.38">The flash cooling process involved in the direct systems results in the loss of some components which are more volatile than water, like oxygen, the components mentioned above and, and other desirable or undesirable flavour components, which may lead to a further change of product quality. </s>
