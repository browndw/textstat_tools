<p n="p1.18">
<s n="s1.19;p1.18">The law granted great power to men in marriages, suggesting women were completely subservient to their husband in early modern England; the ownership of her property transferred into his control- 'the husband hath therein an immediate and absolute property devolved to him by the marriage...which can never again revert to the wife'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.001"/>- and he could dispose of her income 'as he thought best'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.19;p1.18">Seemingly, the foundations of her life were in the power of her partner, forcing her to be utterly compliant to his wishes: 'Mine husband is my superior, my better; he hath authority and rule over me'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.19;p1.18">Arguably, spousal relations mirrored a slave-master relationship where women were totally dependent on their husbands to subsist. </s>
<s n="s4.19;p1.18">Indeed, this model of husband-wife relations is elaborated by the fact that, officially, women were the property of their husbands, as she had no separate legal identity. </s>
<s n="s5.19;p1.18">By analysing sources such as letters and diaries however, we gain greater insight into how women did have authority over her husband outside the law, especially emotionally. </s>
<s n="s6.19;p1.18">These sources have limitations- a diary can be written at times of intense emotion, often unreflective of normality- and the essay will address these. </s>
<s n="s7.19;p1.18">Nonetheless, if various sources are studied, a general trend on spousal relations can be discovered; namely, that 'women in...marriages...were mostly not docile and passive'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.19;p1.18">They were estate managers, for instance, in the absence of their husbands. </s>
<s n="s9.19;p1.18">But this authority was temporary, the majority of relationships containing women who were under the ultimate control of their husbands. </s>
<s n="s10.19;p1.18">The central task of the essay therefore is not to question whether women were permanently dominant in relationships, this was extremely rare, but to measure how servile they were to their husbands. </s>
<s n="s11.19;p1.18">The academic debate between Lawrence Stone and Alan Macfarlane is centred on two possible interpretations. </s>
<s n="s12.19;p1.18">For Stone, women were extremely servile since early modern England was 'a time of emotional distance.... with a corresponding lack of intimacy in mutual relationships<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.005"/>', giving no opportunity for women to possess authority over his emotions. </s>
<s n="s13.19;p1.18">Contrastingly, for Macfarlane, women were virtually equal. </s>
<s n="s14.19;p1.18">This essay will side with the optimistic argument that women were 'like subjects and servants, though subordinate they had separate rights'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.19;p1.18">Also, this assessment of how servile women were may be affected by socio-economic background, a consideration that will be explored. </s>
<s n="s16.19;p1.18">For instance, women from the lower ranks of society were perceived as a greater economic asset, possibly establishing a more egalitarian relationship. </s>
<s n="s17.19;p1.18">Also, an assessment of other pillars of authority over married women- parents and social institutions- will be conducted. </s>
<s n="s18.19;p1.18">Essentially however, this essay will aspire to illustrate that women were not absolutely servile to husbands, their experience of marriage involving 'both partnership and hierarchy, love and mastery'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s19.19;p1.18">Nonetheless, husbands were the ultimate authority over their spouse in marriage, women having power within limits. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p2.18">One model of spousal relations is strictly vertical, the wife controlled completely by the will of her husband. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p2.18">Evidence of this permanent servility to him is provided in the end of letters, which women regularly signed "Your faithful and obedient wife"<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.18">Accordingly, her complete servility stems from the husband's control of the props that she needed to survive: her chattels and her income. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.18">This dependence on the man manufactured a situation where she had to be servile to his demands, just so she might continue to live. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.18">This is exemplified by the case of Lady Margaret Cunninghame. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p2.18">As she was financially dependent on her husband, there was nothing more she could do but obey the stipulations of her husband that once included leaving the house in the middle of the night naked<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p2.18">Further, women had to endure physical brutality as permission was granted to husbands to exercise violence over them as a means of correction: 'there was a level of tolerance for men beating their wives on the grounds that it was a wife's duty to be obedient to their husband'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p2.18">As Anne Dormer possessed no power to prevent the 'oppressions I have lain'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.011"/>, lacking in physical strength and the law unable to protect her, she simply had to tolerate the physical demands of her husband. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p2.18">This subservience is elaborated by the fact that though women theoretically could be granted separation <hi rend="italic">a mensa et thoro</hi>, it was in practice almost impossible to achieve<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p2.18">Primarily, this was because remarriage was forbidden, wives thus pressurised into staying with their partner since a male-dominated public sphere meant she depended on living with a husband for adequate income. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p2.18">Furthermore, after the dissolution of a marriage, they sacrificed their property rights to the man and were denied access to their children<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p2.18">Literally, women just had to endure the demands of her husband, as there was no practical route of escape. </s>

<p n="p3.18">
<s n="s1.8;p3.18">Keith Thomas supports this conception that the man possessed total authority and women were totally servile in marriages by advocating that wives were also subservient to the sexual demands of their husbands. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.18">Importantly, whereas infidelity committed by the male was 'mild and pardonable'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.014"/>, adultery by women was seen as a severer crime as they did not have the inability, like men, to separate the powers of lust and love. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.18">This led to two situations; first, women had to endure the sexual indulgences of their husbands as male infidelity was often unpunished, <hi rend="italic">divortium a mensa et thoro</hi> for such an offence almost never granted. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.18">Second, women could not have sex with anyone else as this was 'recognised as valid grounds for...divorce'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.015"/>- a nightmarish situation because of the inability to remarry and thus be without a husband they so desperately depended on. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.18">Also, the penalties imposed on women included the loss of her hair<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.016"/> and the sacrifice of her inheritance<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.18">These repressive rules meant women were imprisoned to have sex only ever with her husband, reaffirming the concept that she was absolutely servile to him. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.18">Fascinatingly, Sharpe also outlines that man's desire for a chaste wife forced women to be unblemished because they needed a husband to subsist, creating a situation where faithful wives remained eternally the property of one man. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.18">This leaves an assessment that women in pre-1700 marriages were utterly subservient to their husbands. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p4.18">Nonetheless, 'the most detailed information we have about ordinary marriages comes from the histories of marriages that went seriously wrong and ended up in court'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.018"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.18">For most partnerships, the husband did not force his wife to be totally servile to his sexual or physical demands. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.18">Keith Thomas's supposition that women had to endure the sexual unfaithfulness of their husbands, for example, is countered by the unwillingness of an overwhelming quantity of men to indulge in adultery. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.18">Principally, this is because of religious teaching that infidelity was equally sinful for both sexes: 'Think not thy husband tied to this rule, O woman; nor thou thy wife tied, O husband, and the other free: the tie is equal'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.019"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.18">Even if adultery was committed, the bulk of women from a lower socio-economic background were not pressurised to bear it because a viable option for them was abandonment<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.020"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.18">They were less dependent on their husbands than ladies of the gentry as most earned a wage being charwomen, street sellers, laundresses, carters, street cleaners or prostitutes. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.18">Moreover, poorer women could easily commit infidelity themselves as, debatably, the poor had a more unconcerned attitude towards it: 'the tradition of promiscuity was...strong'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.021"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.18">Moreover, there were limits to the demands husbands could impose on their wives; society frowned upon a bully. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.18">Mr Littleton, for instance, was ordered to take his wife home after he had demanded she leave<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.022"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.18">Thus, for the majority of the population, women were not completely subservient to their husbands as they were hardly ever subject to any demands, and if they were, there was a limit to how much they had to endure before the court supported them or they in fact deserted their partner. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p5.18">As women were largely not aware of their husband's power, she probably felt like a partner in marriage, equal to her husband. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p5.18">Moreover, although letters were not supposed to use "Sweet" or "Sweetheart", the moral theologian William Gouge declaring in 1622 that only modes of address which indicated the authority of men like "Dear Sir" were to be used, 'women were clearly using familiar modes of address'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.024"/>. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p6.18">Consequently, we are left with a model of spousal relations that places women somewhere between being totally servile and totally equal in a marriage. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.18">The method this essay will adopt to discover her exact status will be to analyse how much authority she possessed over her husband; if she possessed little, one would be inclined to believe women were more servile, whereas more authority would indicate that, though subordinate, she had a great deal of power that made her a type of junior partner. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p7.18">Indisputably, women possessed certain powers over her partner; a striking exemplification is her capacity to give or withhold sexual favours<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.026"/>. </s>
