<s n="s1.5;p17.25">According to table 7.6 on page 174 of <hi rend="italic">Technology of Cereals</hi> by Kent and Evers 4 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> edition, the amount of protein in flour in 1992 ranged from 11.0% to 14.7% in wholemeal. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.25">This makes the value determined in this experiment relatively low although the literature values are more than 10 years old in general using the Kjeldahl method does not completely recover all nitrogen present in a given protein. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.25">This is due to extremely firmly combined heterocyclic rings (histidine and tryptophan), which requires prolonged boiling of up to 10 hours before they can be converted into ammonium sulphate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.25">Along with this the possibility of ammonium ions being converted to volatile nitric acid due to vigorous oxidising conditions during digestion. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.25">Although the latter may only cause negligible loss in nitrogen it would still have an effect on the amount of nitrogen collected. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.25">
<s n="s1.2;p18.25">The main reason why wheat flour is the main type used for making aerated bread is due to the properties of the proteins which when mixed with water forms gluten an elastic substance. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.25">Protein has a significant effect of the quality of the bread as there is a positive correlation between it's concentration and the specific volume of the loaf. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.25">
<s n="s1.3;p19.25">The amount of nitrogen in glycine was calculated to be 22%, this is higher than the value obtained by calculation from the molecular formula as the average concentration of nitrogen in proteins is stated to be around 16% and the value obtained from calculating the mass in one mole is 18.67%, an ideal value would have been between the two. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.25">The value obtained in this experiment may be down to the concentration of glycine used or error during distillation or titration. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.25">To try and eliminate this type of error one would attempt to gain two titre values ideally within 0.05ml of one an other to show consistency and accuracy both in the method given and the way in which it was being applied. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.25">
<s n="s1.3;p20.25">Steps taken to ensure accurate results in this experiment include gaining two titre values to aid in the calculations which would attempt to reduce error and an average of the two values would be used. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.25">Transfer of liquids was done as quickly as possible as moving with a pipette full of solution across a room to place it into a volumetric flask allows for leakage along the way and one drop is around a 0.05ml loss. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.25">Pieces of the dilstillation equipment where washed out and the washings where added to the filtrate to accumulate as much of the distillate as possible. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p21.25">Aside from human error there is normally a standard error with each piece of glassware. </s>
