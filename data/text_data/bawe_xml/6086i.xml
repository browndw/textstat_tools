<p n="p1.39">
<s n="s1.14;p1.39">
<hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> is an important pathogen due to a combination of toxin-mediated virulence, invasiveness and antibiotic resistance. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p1.39">
<hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</hi> bacteria are gram-positive, spherical (cocci-shaped) and often simply called "staph" bacteria. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p1.39">Staph bacteria can live harmlessly on many skin surfaces, especially around the nose, mouth, genitals, and rectum. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p1.39">But when the skin is punctured or broken for any reason, staph bacteria can enter the wound and cause an infection. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p1.39">The close association of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> with humans leads to the inevitable contamination of many foodstuffs. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p1.39">Normally, Staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by the enterotoxins. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p1.39">The most common associated foods are milk products including dried milk, ice cream, custard and cheese; poultry products; cold or cooked meats as well as canned foods. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p1.39">Often, food handlers pose risks, however, the environment in which food is kept (e.g. temperature, time) is more important, as high numbers of bacterial cells are required to produce enough enterotoxin. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p1.39">As such, adequate hygiene and precautions become necessary to prevent the multiplication of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> in foods and keep the cell numbers low enough so that no hazards are presented to health. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p1.39">Several techniques have been developed for the examination of foods for <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> to show whether the numbers present are low or <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> is present/absent. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p1.39">For instance, selective agar (Baird-Parker, 1960) culture for the isolation of cells followed by tests for the production of coagulase and thermostable nuclease; biochemical testing; serotyping as well as toxin detection---considered to be more reliable. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p1.39">In this exercise, selective agar culture and tests for <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> will be utilized for both the enumeration and detection of the bacteria in the food sample supplied. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p1.39">The test is mainly based on the agglutination properties of most human strains of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> with the test reagent including fibrinogen and rabbit lgG. As long as the pure culture of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> react with the reagent, agglutination reactions are supposed to take place between the fibrinogen and bound coagulase; Fc portion of lgG and Protein A as well as specific lgG and capsular polysaccharide, where the bound coagulase and Protein A are possessed by most strains of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus.</hi> </s>

<item> 25g of food was weighed into a sterile stomacher bag</item>
<item> 225ml of MRD was added and homogenize by stomaching for 1 minute</item>
<item> The solids were allowed to settle and 10ml of the supernatant was transferred to a</item>
<item>sterile bottle. </item>
<item> 1ml of the sample suspension was transferred to 3 plates of Baird-Parker agar,</item>
<item>while the inoculum was equitably distributed to the 3 plates (e.g. 0.3, 0.3, 0.4ml). Then the inoculum was spreaded over the surfaces of the plates using a sterile plastic spreader. </item>
<item> 0.1ml of the sample was pipetted onto a fourth plate of Baird-Parker agar and spreaded as before. Afterwards, the plates were left on the bench, with agar layer lower-most, until the inoculum was absorbed.</item>
<item>The plates were incubated at 37°C+/-1°C and examined after 24h and 48h. (N.B. Check that the surface is dry before putting the plates for incubation)</item>

<head rend="bold">b) Count typical <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> colonies. (tips)</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.39">
<s n="s1.3;p6.39">After 24h, typical <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> colonies are 1-1.5mm in diameter, black shiny, convex, with a narrow white entire margin, and are surrounded by clear zones (due to proteolysis) extending 2-5mm into the medium. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.39">Staphylococci other than <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> may grow and cause clearing in the medium within 24h but these usually also form a dense precipitate (probably caused by a lipase) within the cleared zone. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.39">
<hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> does not normally form such a precipitate until after 24h incubation and some strains do not do so even then. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.39">
<s n="s1.2;p7.39">Plates should be re-examined after 48h because some strains of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi> require 36h or more to produce typical colonies, and others, on primary isolation from foods, may require up to 48h to form typical colonies. </s>

<p n="p10.39">

<s n="s2.3;p10.39">Protein A has the ability to bind to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (lgG). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.39">In some strains, capsular polysaccharide can mask both bound coagulase and Protein A and, thereby, prevent agglutination. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.39">
<s n="s1.2;p11.39">Staphtect Plus uses blue latex particles coated with both porcine fibrinogen and rabbit lgG (including specific antibodies against capsular polysaccharide antigen of <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi>). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.39">When the reagent is mixed with <hi rend="italic">S. aureus</hi>, rapid agglutination occurs through reactions between: 1) fibrinogen and bound coagulase; 2) Fc portion of lgG and Protein A; 3)specific lgG and capsular polysaccharide. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.39">
<s n="s1.1;p12.39">The Staphtect Plus kit includes a Test Reagent of a suspension of blue latex particles coated as above, a Control Reagent of a suspension of unsensitised blue latex particles and a Reaction card with white circle. </s>
