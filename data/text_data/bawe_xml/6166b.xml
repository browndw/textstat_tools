<s n="s2.2;p1.13">Students almost can consume food following the dietary reference values (DRV) of the UK. However, there's not much difference in most of the dietary values between the students and the general UK residents (Hendersonal. 2003) except that the students have a less satisfactory result in the consumption of macronutrients (Table 1). </s>

<s n="s6.9;p6.13">The total fat intake of male (35.8% of total energy intake) exceeds the recommended values (&lt;35% of total energy intake<ref target="BAWE_6166b-ftnote.004"/>). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.13">Therefore, the male students are advised to reduce the fat intake. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.13">Furthermore, the male group consumed cholesterol (481mg per day) more than the recommended intake (&lt;300mg per day) by the American Heart Association, which also suggests people with high blood total cholesterol level (>200 mg/dL) should ingest less than 200mg cholesterol per day. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.13">High cholesterol intake is not the primary cause of high blood cholesterol (high fat and carbohydrate intake do) (NHLBI, 2005), but it does play a role in it and thus it's necessary to reduce the intake of food having high cholesterol level . </s>

<p n="p8.13">
<s n="s1.3;p8.13">Alcohol consumption of both male and female groups is about 6% of total energy intake, but male' daily intake is 24.5g which is above the daily recommended value - 20g (equal to 1.5 pint beer or 2.5 glasses (312ml) of wine). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.13">Although alcohol' energy won't put on weight, young man should not drink too much because alcohol overdose can cause liver disease, gout and other diseases. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p12.13">However, FFQ' food list only covers the simple components of food products. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p12.13">If a subject intakes a variety of food, it will be hardly to fill in the FFQ. Error occurs also as subjects usually "underestimate of their intake, especially the macronutrients - carbohydrate and protein" (Paulal. 2005), also errors may come from poor memory. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p12.13">On the contrary, (Paulal. 2005) also claimed "subjects with higher energy intake tended to over report their intakes of protein and fat". </s>
<s n="s7.9;p12.13">Another error we may consider would be the number of the subjects. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p12.13">In our study, male group only has 23 subjects, therefore, a larger variance may appear. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p12.13">Thus "small number of subjects may not reliable enough" (Paulal. 2005) to represent the fact. </s>
