<s n="s1.6;p4.8">Clearly a charter will always be open to interpretation. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.8">However, it could be argued that there is a more significant conflict which runs through the UN and its members. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.8">These two statements could be said to have their origins in two different theories or ideologies of world politics. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.8">The first originating in a liberal-socialistic view of the world, where the aims among others are for people to unite across (or despite of) state borders, to defend human rights and to promote justice. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.8">The latter is more representative of a realist view of the world based on state sovereignty (as applied during and immediately after the second world war, when the UN was founded) and the pursuit of power by all states. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.8">These underlying theories are evident in many debates which the UN faces and arguably, in the following examples of supposed failure of effectiveness. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"It might well be better if Brazil, India, Japan, South Africa or even the European Union were on the Security Council, and if more countries, or no countries at all, had a veto." <ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.005"/> Many critics have called for reform within the security council which, due to the power of veto, allows the five permanent members control over most decisions in the UN. To adopt the theoretical view mentioned above, the argument of whether this leads to ineffectiveness in the UN would differ according to one's expectations of its aims. Clearly, to a liberal-socialist, the unequal power that the five permanent members can exercise is undemocratic and un-representative. It could be argued that the five permanent members no longer reflect the most important or significant world powers, that large geographical parts of the world are unrepresented and that the whole concept of allowing certain members more power than others undermines the principles of the UN as identified by Chris Brown: "International relations would become a realm of law and not a realm of power"<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.006"/>.</quote>

<p n="p5.8">
<s n="s1.1;p5.8">While, this inherent problem may produce ineffectiveness, for example in the use of abstention over Israeli occupation of the West Bank, there are more significant problems which the UN faces, which I will address later in the essay. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.13;p6.8">The invasion of Iraq led to criticism of the UN throughout the world: "The UN's credibility was down in the US because it did not support the US Administration on the war, and in 19 other countries because it did not prevent the war." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s2.13;p6.8">Whilst it has been argued that some of these 19 countries pursued their own self-interests in refusing to back America, here I will argue that this event must be put into the context of an ideological struggle. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p6.8">Madeleine Albright (former US ambassador to the United Nations), describes the approach the Bush Administration has adopted towards the UN: "they started acting as if the UN were a burden and denigrated it"<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p6.8">It must be asked, why is the UN a burden to the US? </s>
<s n="s5.13;p6.8">Ideologically, they can be seen to differ enormously. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p6.8">America's reasons or rather justifications for invading Iraq are arguably based on realist principles: the threat of weapons of mass destruction seemingly provoked America to attack Iraq before Iraq could attack America and the argument for humanitarian intervention was not based on liberal principles but again related to self-interest: it can be said that the US utilised the UN-accepted principle of humanitarian intervention in order to increase its chances of winning a resolution. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p6.8">However, it is clear that despite the will of the UN to promote and defend human rights, its ideology does not stretch to intervention without just cause (i.e. threat to another state), or without evaluating the relative advantages of intervention to citizens in comparison to non-intervention. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p6.8">Again, this has its foundation in the socialist idea that the welfare of people should supersede that of the state. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p6.8">This ideological conflict was also evident in the Kosovo crisis and can be seen to cause ineffectiveness in the UN: "US domination has led to a true crisis in the UN and within the world community. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p6.8">I refer to Kosovo".<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.009"/> It is accepted that we live at present in a uni-lateral world, but the implications for the UN do not and should not mean subordination to the power of America. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p6.8">For as Yevgeny Primakov asks: "Should we accept that the US administration has found a realistic approach to establishing peace and maintaining security in the world? </s>
<s n="s12.13;p6.8">Hardly, if only for the reason that it eschews collective efforts and strengthens the cult of individual, solitary action by the US." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s13.13;p6.8">To return to the question of effectiveness then, it could be argued that over the invasion of Iraq, the UN according to liberal-socialist principles and in the context of a uni-lateral world, worked as effectively as it could: "...the refusal by a majority of members of the Security Council to support the attack was in its own way an important victory." <ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<s n="s1.15;p7.8">The effectiveness of the UN to counter the power of the US is therefore arguably greater than commonly thought and since the war in Iraq, potentially increasing. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p7.8">However, where the UN seems to lack effectiveness, is among the most powerful institutions in the world (arguably more powerful than America): transnational corporations. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p7.8">Perhaps Kofi Annan was following socialist principles of cooperation and discussion when he proposed the 'Global Compact': a corporate partnership programme, aiming to encourage companies to promote and facilitate development in the countries in which they operate. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p7.8">Boutros-Boutros Ghali argues that the role of the UN is global management: "The UN will be compelled sooner or later to manage globalisation..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s5.15;p7.8">However, this partnership arguably had the opposite effect to its intent: "The world's most damaging companies signed up to the cause of sustainable development... </s>
<s n="s6.15;p7.8">Since then their consistent message has been that they understand the issues and will provide solutions - as long as they are left alone to do so." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s7.15;p7.8">Again, conflict of ideology can be identified at the heart of this ineffectiveness. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p7.8">The UN fails due to two main fundamental problems. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p7.8">Firstly, despite its success in evolution towards more liberal policies, (see Baylis and Smith<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.014"/> and Roberts and Kingsbury<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.015"/> for an appraisal of the success of UN agencies and NGOs in humanitarian intervention), its structure is still based on nation-states. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p7.8">Clearly, this organisational method fails to represent other bodies of importance in world politics. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p7.8">Secondly, the ideology which transnational corporations operate according to, that of neo-liberalist economics, discords with those in the UN who believe in the aim: to better the lives of people. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p7.8">Once ideologies are practised, and become norms, they can be used to justify the actions of the organisations which follow them, which is why "the philosophy of the ICC (<hi rend="italic">International Chamber of Commerce</hi>) - that open markets are the key to sustainable development - was not to be challenged, and became the philosophy of the UN." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.016"/>
<s n="s13.15;p7.8">Where the real problem of ineffectiveness lies, is in the lack of opposition from the UN's members to such a philosophy. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p7.8">For as realist based bodies, nation-states need and rely on transnational corporations. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p7.8">So while, the realist versus liberal-socialist ideology conflict is again demonstrated, the triumphant and reigning ideology is neo-liberalism, as implemented by the most powerful institutions in the world. </s>

<s n="s6.12;p8.8">Perhaps, this is where the true effectiveness of the UN lies. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p8.8">It must hold on to its members: for they are its parts, and to do this it must reflect its members differing needs. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p8.8">However, its existence does not simply depend on membership of all the countries in the world: the point of its existence must surely be to better the world according to the needs of its people. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p8.8">It is in this sense indispensable and I would argue that it is as effective as it can be within the constraints of this balance. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p8.8">The decision not to pass a resolution to allow the invasion of Iraq is perhaps indicative of an increase in effectiveness in the future. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p8.8">Where the real challenge lies for the UN, is in its struggle to become the sum of what increasingly matters in world politics: those institutions which guide the world economy. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p8.8">In order to better the world, it must first be representative of the world and without this vital influence in the economy which is prevented by the neo-liberalist principle of free markets, it will forever be reacting to human and environmental problems in the world, not preventing them. </s>
