<s n="s1.6;p12.22">Livestock production, even on a mixed farm such as Edwins Hall, has altered the local landscape, especially in the last fifty years due to mechanisation within the system and this has impacted the landscape. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.22">The production of beef cattle, and up until 1990, a 100 head dairy herd all took place on hill sides of bushy hill and the surrounding flatter areas, this factor relating to the demand for grass for grazing or related produce, silage and hay, and the fact that some of this land was largely unsuitable for cropping. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.22">The push for greater intensification saw hedgerow removal and field boundary change, impacting the biodiversity through loss of habitats within the wild ecosystems. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.22">This also loosens soil structure on hillsides due to less root structure to hold soil together. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.22">Similarly negative to the environment, areas of woodland on Bushy hill have been removed since 1950 in order to create cow tracks and routeways for machinery feeding the stock. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p13.22">Field enlargement has been just one threat to the environment. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p13.22">More recently the problems caused by decades of selective grazing have become ever apparent from the increase in patches of weeds across the fields and a great increase in weed species. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p13.22">This has a cost not only to H.Turner to deal with the thistle problem but also to from the problem of monoculture being created. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p13.22">Just like monocultures on the Russian Steppes of wheat, on a smaller scale, Bushy hill has seen native vegetation wiped out as cattle have grazed, trampled on and left that vegetation which is less favoured by these ruminant animals to become common place. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p13.22">A major weed problem from selected grazing has been the increase in ragwort in the area - a great threat to horses if eaten. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p13.22">Linked to cattle grazing, another major influence on the environment is silage and hay for cattle feed. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p13.22">The continuous cutting of a grass crop sometimes up to three times a year has contributed to a loss of diversity within the area, mainly because of a loss of habitat to wild animals such as butterflies and also as cover to rabbits and field mice etc. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p13.22">Also constant mowing of grassland means that only the dominant species survives, and as much of the land that is hayed is that which is grazed for part the year, the selective grazing impacts are shown through in the hay production and the impacts of modern livestock production are maximised. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p14.22">As on H.Turner a farm will often pull up traditional lays to achieve greater yields of hay crop, and replant with rye grass species, hence losing biodiversity through encouraging dominant species. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.22">This also creates a greater threat of soil erosion through a loss of soil structure, a major problem on slopes such as bushy hill caused by excessive surface runoff compared to flatter areas. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p22.22">In conclusion livestock farming has greatly impacted the landscape, aesthetically creating the countryside that we view today from the dry stone walls of the national parks such as the Lake District to the hedgerow lattice of the west country. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p22.22">It can be suggested that great loss has occurred in relation diversity and habitats to livestock farming. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.22">This is evident from H.Turner's 650ha alone, and that this case study mirrors national trends but the problem is no being recognised and although cannot be reversed, efforts can be made to sustainably manage many of the impacts. </s>
