<s n="s1.6;p1.78">Table 1 (in the appendix) is the summary statistics of some of the variables in the model. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.78">Do note that the 'count' is different for different variables since the dataset wasn't complete. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.78">It could be that when answering the survey, the option 'n/a' was chosen or not filled in at all. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.78">Hence when Stata does calculations and model estimates, it leaves out those missing observations. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.78">I do not believe in adding in arbitrary figures to replace those missing values. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.78">This would lead to biased results especially since Diploma students didn't take the QT test. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.78">
<s n="s1.4;p2.78">The mean <hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi> is 64.9 while its median is 65 and standard deviation is 13.1. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.78">Out of the whole sample population of 408 people, only 388 reported their marks. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.78">Looking at the number of hours students attending classes and lectures (<hi rend="italic">attl, attc, attr)</hi> in general, attendance ranged from 0% to 100%, with lecture and class attendance being on average 80.9 and 82.4 percent. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.78">Meanwhile average revision lecture attendance was much lower at 47.2%. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.78">
<s n="s1.5;p3.78">Table 2 (also in the appendix) shows the correlation between some of the variables that I consider important or interesting in the model. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.78">Note that the correlation coefficients of <hi rend="italic">attl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">attc,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">hrsall</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hrsqt</hi> are relatively high (0.646 and 0.498). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.78">Hence when choosing the model in question 6, I would have to take this into account. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.78">At the same time, the other variables seem to be relatively correlated to <hi rend="italic">qtm ark,</hi> hence they ought to make good candidates for explanatory variables. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.78">For instance the correlation coefficients between <hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi> and <hi rend="italic">attl, attc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hrsall</hi> are 0.226, 0.283 and 0.134. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.78">
<s n="s1.4;p4.78">Table 3 shows the mean mark in some subsamples. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.78">From the table, it can be inferred that it could be possible that for example, being a female would imply a lower test mark (65.4) compared to a male (63.8). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.78">Between years, the average marks are also different - 1999(66.9), 2000(63.3), 2001(61.7) and 2002(69.3). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.78">Still, more testing need be done to verify this. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.78">
<s n="s1.3;p5.78">I have decided not to include any cross plots of variables. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.78">After trying out a few, I have discovered that there aren't any interesting features to note and the variables don't really show any significant correlation in a 2- dimensional graph. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.78">Perhaps if it were possible to represent a multivariable cross plot, more interesting features can be observed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.78">
<s n="s1.7;p6.78">Observing the data, I noticed that there were quite a number of outliers. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.78">For instance, while everyone who had filled up their marks obtained double-digit marks, student number 86 had 8 marks (Table 1). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.78">The next lowest mark was 36. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.78">Then there are those who have answered that they have 87 and 17 A grades at A-levels. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.78">They must have been some kind of wunderkind. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.78">At the same time, there were those who obtained more A-level A grades than the number of A-levels they had, which is impossible. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.78">Unfortunately, I didn't do anything to remedy the presence of these outliers simply because eliminating them would oft require some kind of value judgment. </s>

<p n="p62.78">
<s n="s1.4;p62.78">Gujarati (1998, p.406) suggests that a good model ought to be parsimonious, i.e. it should be kept as simple as possible, consistent with Occam' s razor. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p62.78">It should also be identifiable, has a good fit and be theoretical consistent. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p62.78">In addition to that, the model should have predictive power. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p62.78">Hence when choosing what variables to include, and in what form, I have resisted the temptation to include too many variables into the model. </s>
</p>
<p n="p63.78">
<s n="s1.4;p63.78">In general, I chose the variables through trial and error, although these choices were subject to theoretical consistency. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p63.78">I avoided adding too many variables since many of the variables are highly correlated to each other, hence avoiding the problem of multicollinearity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p63.78">Although I used the R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> and adjusted-R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> values to indicate whether I was heading in the right direction, that is in obtaining better fits, I also maintained that better fits (higher R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> values) do not necessarily imply better models. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p63.78">Throughout the selection of the model, I kept in mind Occam's razor which suggests that we should keep models as simple as possible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p64.78">
<s n="s1.1;p64.78">I have thus reached the conclusion that the following model would be a suitable one to estimate exam performance: </s>

<s n="s1.3;p68.78">This equation estimates that for a <hi rend="italic">unit proportional</hi> increase in the number of classes attended, the exam mark is expected to be 6.41 marks higher. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p68.78">Compare this with model E3 where there is no transformation of the class attendance variable, where in that case the interpretation of the slope coefficient is that for a unit increase in classes attended, the exam mark would rise by 13c. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p68.78">I feel that using ln <hi rend="italic">attc</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">attc</hi> would be better since I believe that there is diminishing returns to class attendance. </s>

<p n="p69.78">

<s n="s2.3;p69.78">Confirmed by my testing whether my personal experience is consistent with the data, I have decided to drop completely lecture attendance from my model. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p69.78">At the same time, the correlation between lecture attendance and class attendance is quite high (0.28) and by dropping this variable, I may increase the efficiency of the model. </s>
</p>
<p n="p70.78">
<s n="s1.3;p70.78">The coefficient of the ratio of number of A grades at A-level over the number of A-level passes is calculated to be 9.13. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p70.78">This ought to be a better indicator of A-level performance rather than the just taking number of A grades since different people take different number of A-level subjects, hence the ratio would be a better indicator of A-level success. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p70.78">Of course, this is assuming that students don't fail any subjects (here I am taking number of A-levels as a proxy of number of A-level subjects taken). </s>

<p n="p71.78">
<s n="s1.2;p71.78">Next I include a transformed of the average number of hours spent studying per week (ln <hi rend="italic">hrsall).</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p72.78">Not everyone taking the survey was in the typical age group of 19-20. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p72.78">I hypothesized that those who continue studying after working a few years are at a disadvantage (they may have forgotten the mathematics they learnt earlier, or it could be that older students are, the less used they are to taking tests and studying for them, or simply because the brain works less well the older one gets). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p72.78">True enough, the estimate of coefficient of ln <hi rend="italic">age</hi> is -9.75 and with a high t-statistic. </s>

<p n="p73.78">
<s n="s1.3;p73.78">Considering students from different years face different exam questions, I included the dummy variables for the years 2000 and 2001. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p73.78">1999 was excluded since adding a dummy variable didn't significantly improve the fit. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p73.78">Looking at the coefficients of these dummies, it could be casually suggested that perhaps the exams in these two years were exceptionally tougher than that in 1999 and 2002, or perhaps the students in these batches were exceptionally less bright. </s>
</p>
<p n="p74.78">
<s n="s1.4;p74.78">Before adding the dummy variable for the UK, I was expecting UK students to have some advantage over international students. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p74.78">UK students have a better command of English and they do not have to experience great changes in their lifestyles. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p74.78">On the contrary, the equation estimates show that being a UK student, your expected mark would be 5.7 less than an international student. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p74.78">Trying to explain this, I guess that perhaps it is the brighter batch of students in each country that qualify to go abroad to study here, whereas in the UK, Tony Blair and Labour's policy of trying to push everyone (even those not suited for it) through university education has caused a deterioration in the quality of UK students overall. </s>
</p>
<p n="p75.78">
<s n="s1.4;p75.78">I also included the dummy variables <hi rend="italic">econ,</hi> which identifies students who take straight economics (as opposed to other variants of it) and <hi rend="italic">mathpass</hi> (which wasn't defined in the question, although I suppose it is a pass in math at A-level). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p75.78">It is pretty obvious that those who have done well in math examinations in the past would continue to do so in the future. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p75.78">I added the dummy variable <hi rend="italic">econ</hi> since the prerequisite for this course is a high math grade and I assumed that those in straight economics would be those who have a greater interest/liking for math. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p75.78">True enough, the coefficients of these variables are positive and significant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p76.78">
<s n="s1.3;p76.78">The R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> and adjusted R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> values of this model are 0.231 and 0.207 respectively, which means that 23% of the model can be explained by the independent variables, which I feel is a "fair" value, considering the tradeoff between a high R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> value and the number of variables. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p76.78">Performing the goodness of fit test, I obtained F=9.43 which is greater than the critical value <hi rend="sub">F9,282,1%=2.41.</hi> </s>

<s n="s3.3;p77.78">So, in general, equation estimates with different variables had different numbers of observations, and the greater the number of variables in an equation estimate, the harder it was to find complete observations, hence the lower the number of observations. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p78.78">There are many variables that explain a particular person's exam performance. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p78.78">A good attempt to model exam performance thus has to be one that tries to encompass as many of these variables while still keeping things simple (in the number and choice of variables). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p78.78">Some skepticism should also be applied to the quality of the survey - the incompleteness of the data, the way questions were phrased, the inclusiveness of the whole population. </s>
