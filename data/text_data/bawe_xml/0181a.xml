<s n="s1.2;p1.14">
<hi rend="bold italic">Tsunami</hi>: A term created by Japanese fishermen, meaning "harbour wave". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.14">It was coined after the sailors returned to port to find it had been devastated by waves, which had passed by unnoticed whilst they were at sea. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.3;p2.14">Tsunamis are a series of large waves in a body of water, such as a lake or the ocean. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.14">Tsunamis are often mislabelled as <hi rend="italic">tidal waves</hi> - an inaccurate description, as tides play no part in the formation of tsunami. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.14">They are in fact caused by various disturbances in the ocean, most commonly underwater earthquakes (directly, or indirectly via undersea landslides) or volcanic eruptions. </s>

</figure>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.2;p3.14">The sudden movement of an undersea earthquake (or other disturbance) causes the water above the fault to rise, forming a "hump" of water higher than the average sea level (see diagram above). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.14">The hump then ripples outwards across the ocean; similar to the way ripples form when a stone is thrown into the water. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.3;p4.14">One of the major differences between tsunami and traditional waves is the way tsunami travel through the water. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.14">Waves are, in simple terms, the movement of energy through a material, or <hi rend="italic">medium</hi>, in this case water. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.14">A normal wave will travel above the water's surface (hence surfing is a popular sport); however the energy of a tsunami travels through the entire depth of the water, and thus the speed at which it can travel depends on the depth at that point. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.14">
<s n="s1.2;p5.14">The practical upshot of this is that tsunami will move faster (up to 950km/hour) in deeper water, and as a result the wave is little higher than the usual sea level. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.14">This explains why the Japanese fishermen failed to notice the wave that destroyed the harbour - at sea the typical tsunami is up to 1 metre above sea level, scarcely noticeable amongst the usual tides. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.14">
<s n="s1.4;p6.14">This does not mean, however, that tsunamis are all small waves. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.14">As the energy is spread over the depth of the ocean, in shallower areas this causes the tsunami to compress, both slowing it down (to about 50km/hour) and raising it higher above sea level. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.14">Compare this to using a blunt knife and a sharp knife to cut things - because the sharp knife edge is much thinner and finer, it can cut things the blunt knife cannot. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.14">Similarly, the shallower water means the energy of the tsunami is focused in a smaller area, making the impact of a strong tsunami devastating. </s>

<p n="p7.14">
<s n="s1.5;p7.14">The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is perhaps the best example of the devastating effect of a strong tsunami. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.14">As seen in the picture above, the height of the wave grew far beyond 1 metre. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.14">The tallest tsunami ever recorded reached a height of 64 metres on impacting Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia, in 1737. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.14">It is a misconception that all tsunamis are huge and devastating, however. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.14">Tsunamis are an everyday occurrence, with sizes ranging from barely noticeable, right up to cataclysm. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.14">
<s n="s1.3;p8.14">Another common misconception is that a tsunami only consists of one wave impact. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.14">In fact, most tsunami, including the Indian Ocean tsunami, occur in a series, or <hi rend="italic">train</hi>, of strong floods over a period of up to 90 minutes after the initial impact (see below left). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.14">A single, enormous wave, such as in the picture below right, is known instead as a <hi rend="italic">tidal</hi> <hi rend="italic">bore.</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.1;p9.14">To summarize: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.14">
<s n="s1.2;p10.14">Tsunamis are caused by displacement of water, most commonly due to undersea earthquakes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.14">They are NOT caused by tidal forces. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.14">
<s n="s1.1;p11.14">Tsunamis travel through the entire depth of the ocean, and their speed depends on the depth of water they are travelling through. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.1;p12.14">As the water gets shallower, the tsunami slows down and grows taller. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.2;p13.14">Tsunamis rarely form a single wave - instead they occur as a series of fast floods. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.14">Research why! </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.1;p14.14">When it impacts on a coastline, the damage can be extensive, or the impact can go unnoticed amongst the normal tides. </s>
