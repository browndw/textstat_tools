<s n="s1.3;p1.9">Rousseau has always been typified as an intellectual outsider; it was, however, only in the twentieth century that his socio-political theory came to be seen as a threat to the individual's liberty.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.001"/> Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.9">'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.002"/> And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.003"/> From the point of view of Rousseau, most importantly protection should be rendered against the emergence of a minority rule, or 'particular will', rather than against the state, which, after all, represents the sovereignty of the lawgiver as it corresponds with the community's best interest, the general will. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.9">The question I will look at here is thus to what extent the critical assertion holds truth that 'the more safeguards he established against despotism, the more weapons he forged for tyranny',<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.004"/> within Rousseau's system of the social contract. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.9">Recent criticism has argued that the Cold War split has caused intellectuals to make an over-simplified distinction between 'individualistic liberalism and state collectivism', stating that Rousseau was on the totalitarian side of the argument.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.005"/> Rousseau, however, from the outset entertains an awareness of the problem of new forms of subjugation that hide behind a powerful state, and thus sets out to construct a model for a 'form of association [...] in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain free as before'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.006"/> In this sense, Rousseau undertakes to find a form in which freedom can be exercised on a public, political level.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.007"/> The important distinction that has to be made here though, is the type of freedom at stake. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.9">Arguing that pre-modern, pre-social man exercised an individual sovereignty free from social obligation or commitment, knew a natural, brutal kind of liberty.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.008"/> When people come to regular interaction, they become interdependent, which goes accompanied by fierce passions.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.009"/> It is only within society that morality comes to exist, through virtue and <hi rend="italic">piti√©</hi>, a form of compassion which counters man's corruption by society.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.010"/> What is then needed is the construction of an association in which passions are tempered and virtue is encouraged. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.9">In this sense, envisaging a social contract is merely a theoretical exercise, to find a form in which such an exercise of sovereignty can be best expressed, in other words, 'Rousseau's purpose is to discover a <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> which has <hi rend="italic">moral validity</hi>'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.011"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.9">Another point of view insists on the juxtaposition of democracy and liberalism, positioning Rousseau in a radically democratic framework.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.012"/> Certainly, this view depends greatly on the view one takes of liberalism. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.9">Liberalism can be taken at an individual level, stressing the removal of any constraint on human action (negative liberty), and placing theory in wider context, that of the body politic (positive liberty).<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.013"/> Rousseau is quite explicit about what form of liberty we are to seek. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.9">'Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains', he argues, 'One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.014"/> It is therefore clear that Rousseau seeks a wider answer to the question of liberty, one for which 'it is necessary to ensure that the conditions in which [people] live do not pose a threat to their survival'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.015"/> This condition can be brought about by the realisation that it is the best interest of all citizens to care for other's interest and well-being. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.9">Here we find the distinction that Rousseau makes between a narrow form of personal interest and a wider, more coherent form of enlightened interest, being the best for the community, and thus, indirectly, each citizen's actual will, as it secures the best-considered proposal and enjoys general support of the citizenry. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.9">Exercising one's freedom through abiding by the law is only reasonable if lawgiver and subject are the same person. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.9">This is where Rousseau takes a radically democratic stance, criticising Kant's very open assertion that law can still be legitimate only by the requirement that the requirement 'that the proposal <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been agreed to <hi rend="italic">had</hi> the citizens been consulted and <hi rend="italic">were</hi> they fully rational'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.017"/> Hence Rousseau's claim that 'power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will':<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.018"/> for the general will to function, it requires the individual standpoints of each citizen. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.9">Unanimity is thereby not needed; it is in fact a sign of an unhealthy body politic. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.9">The only law that requires unanimity of all citizens is the social pact, since by this each individual hands over their individual sovereignty to the higher expression of the community.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.019"/> Within the body politic, the general will aims to protect rather than to attack its participants, and 'it is not', therefore, 'to be assumed that any of the parties then expects to get hanged'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.020"/> Likewise, peace with neighbouring communities is required by natural law. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s5.5;p4.9">It has therefore been claimed that the general will represents a model for the well-being of all, and thus reflects 'each individual's good or real will'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.022"/> </s>

<s n="s2.4;p6.9">Both reveal traces of absolutist totalitarianism: 'It is absolutely necessary that evil come from others and from them alone'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.027"/> Despite the validity of a critique of Rousseau's reassertion that the general will is infallible (which indeed shows traces of a majority intolerance), it is difficult if not altogether impossible to find examples of the Rousseauean state in practice. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.9">Eastern block socialism, which has been suggested as imposing some for of a state-directed will upon its citizens, has been severely criticised.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.028"/> Also the Jacobin adoption of Rousseau's general will has been seen as of symbolic value rather than a precise influence of his thought. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.9">Lacking everywhere has been the binding together of lawgiver and subject, which according to Rousseau results only in the imposition a particular will of a state governed by a political elite. <ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.029"/> </s>

<s n="s2.3;p7.9">Through this construct, Rousseau categorically denies the individual any sovereignty except for a participatory role in the community. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.9">Effectively, the state attains a strongly fortified position in which ' [t]he more the natural strengths are dead and destroyed, the more the acquired ones are great and durable, and the more solid and perfect this institution is'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.031"/> Such a radical step toward an active, creative form of liberalism challenges liberals into the debate of the equalisation of the citizenry, since 'serious economic inequalities destroy liberty'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.032"/> Nonetheless, it does not suffice to, as a consequence of this conclusion, leave all individual property and grounds for action within the confines of the community's sovereignty. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p8.9">'If this leads to intervention in 'areas which are perceived as illiberal, such as the social and economic conditions of citizen's lives and with their beliefs and values', this is seen by Rousseau as a decision of the general will in order to secure the necessary conditions for socio-political liberty.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.035"/> To some extent the modern welfare state can be seen as a moderate outcome of Rousseau's general will, be it on a representative basis. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p9.9">Rather does he see liberty in a community best exercised at the highest level, thus enhancing liberty in an ordered way.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.037"/> For order to exist, there needs to be unity based on a reasonable principle; the social contract offers just that. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p9.9">As liberty exercised only on the most individual, narrow level only furthers contradiction in interests, Rousseau proposes the pursuit of community interest, which, if carried out fully, secures the welfare and safety of all its citizens. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p9.9">What Rousseau does not display enough attention to, however, was the fact that 'there is never a perfect fit between moral requirements of our rational nature and requirements of citizenship'.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.038"/> This results in a lack of consideration of the nature of the general will, and its proper domain. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p9.9">Rousseau, on the contrary, believes in the stabilising role of the general will, and the inalienability of the will in general.<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.039"/> As the general will represent the only genuine method of determining the sovereign will of the citizenry, parallels drawn between totalitarian ideological states and Rousseau's general will are, strictly theoretical, incorrect. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p9.9">The problem, nonetheless, lies with the radical solution Rousseau's general will poses. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.9">Asserting that '[t]o be governed by appetite alone is slavery, while obedience to a law one prescribes to oneself is freedom',<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.040"/> leaves very little space for individual action. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p9.9">Thus, a community taking its legislative task to the extreme, might indeed force its citizens into abide by the law. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0003j-ftnote.041"/>
<s n="s10.10;p9.9">The question becomes, then, not to what extent Rousseau can be used for totalitarian ends, which he explicitly sets out to prevent, but rather how a feasible system may be envisaged in which particular interpretations of the general good can obtain a stable construct in which the individual is both more protected and better positioned to criticise the state's pursuit of the general good. </s>
