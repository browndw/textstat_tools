</p>
</note>
<p n="p1.26">
<s n="s1.8;p1.26">Montaigne's final sentence to his short preface, 'To the Reader', reveals the aims of the writer in completing his essays and the subject he is intending to focus upon; himself. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.26">However, even though the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> are based on one 'everyman character', Montaigne invites the reader to contemplate, through this single man's experiences and thoughts, their own views and morals. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.26">He attempts, as the word 'assay' suggests, to 'hunt for truth, personality and a knowledge of humanity through an exploration of his own reaction to his... experiences'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.26">This relates to the constant theme running throughout his 'unconventional biography', which is that of 'the self'. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.26">Expectations are therefore set up for the reader immediately, in the sense that many major themes seen throughout the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> are introduced in this preface, as it is brimming with the suggestion of many significant ideas and topics. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.26">Montaigne's chapters 'On repenting' of Book III and 'On liars' of Book I are it seems greatly significant in the light of the preface 'To the Reader', as many ideas explored in these essays, relate back to this unique introduction. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.26">These themes, often interwoven with each other, include truth and lies, the 'Nature' of individuals and the 'native' being, repentance, as previously mentioned the theme of 'the self' and many more minor topics. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.26">Each one is in need of study for the importance of the preface for our appreciation of these chosen chapters to become clear. </s>

</note>
<p n="p2.26">
<s n="s1.1;p2.26">In the preface, Montaigne sets up an inviting, humorous and 'trusting' ambiance through the use of a colloquial style and ironic tone: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'It is not reasonable that you should employ your leisure on a topic so frivolous and so vain'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.003"/>.</quote>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p3.26">
<s n="s1.3;p3.26">This ironic but typically good-humoured statement by Montaigne almost acts as an escape to criticism as it is a form of warning to the reader that they may not appreciate his 'attempts'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.26">Simultaneously it cleverly intrigues the reader and entices them to read on. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.26">Montaigne often uses this 'self-depreciating' tone, such as in the opening of 'On repenting': </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'I give an account of Man and sketch a picture of a particular one of them who is very badly formed'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.004"/>.</quote>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.26">
<s n="s1.2;p4.26">This characteristic tone seems to represent Montaigne's feelings on the 'limited scope' of his attempts. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.26">This illustrates the idea of the preface hinting to the reader the content and style of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> to follow. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.1;p5.26">Montaigne makes a reference to another culture in 'To the Reader' to emphasise his point by using a rather shocking and powerful image for the reader: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'had I found myself among those peoples who are said to live under the sweet liberty of Nature's primal laws, I can assure you that I would most willingly have portrayed myself whole, and wholly naked'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.005"/>.</quote>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p6.26">
<s n="s1.4;p6.26">In doing so, the writer wants to stress his disclosure and bare truth. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.26">The use of examples, anecdotes and fictional characters is an important part to Montaigne's <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> and can be found throughout his work, more specifically in both chapters, 'On repenting' and 'On liars'. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.26">They act to support Montaigne's ideas and theories and they also convey the humanist writer's extended knowledge and wider reading. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.26">Montaigne often juxtaposes classical references with 'earthy anecdotes' as can be seen in the chapter 'On repenting' in which he writes of the story from his own experience of a 'peasant' 'born to beggary' who 'became a thief' which is immediately followed by information of 'Pythagorean' philosophy: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'I cannot follow the Pythagorean dogma that men take on a new soul'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.006"/>. </quote>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.006">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">M. Montaigne, <hi rend="italic">The Complete Essay</hi>, p. 916. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p7.26">
<s n="s1.2;p7.26">These 'historical examples of behaviour (exempla) followed by pithy reflections on the human condition (sententiae)'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.007"/>, were a 'ready-made format for books'. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.26">Montaigne claimed that he owned around 1000 volumes in his own private library, which can clearly be seen through his familiarity with literature from 'antiquity' and his continuous references to such philosophers and important theorists as Plutarch, Aristotle, Socrates and many others, expressed throughout the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.26">
<s n="s1.7;p8.26">The 'Nature' of man is an idea Montaigne often refers back to as can be observed in both the chosen chapters of study. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.26">Again however, the reader is introduced to the idea in the preface, as are so many other themes. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.26">Montaigne had 'unbounded approval and trust'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.008"/> in 'Nature' and believed humans had a 'native form' which they should not stray from. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.26">In 'To the Reader', Montaigne tells the reader how they 'will read of my defects and native form'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.26">To follow a natural path in life is how it should be in Montaigne's eyes. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.26">In the chapter 'On liars', he writes of how a 'natural defect' should not be seen as a 'deliberate one' and this 'misfortune' should not create 'malice which is the enemy of my natural humour'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.26">He also personifies 'Nature' later on in the chapter and also in the preface, to emphasise 'her' importance and value in his own mind: </s>

<s n="s1.1;p11.26">Once again it is obvious to note Montaigne's beliefs and ideas when it comes to 'Nature' and how the preface leads us, the reader, onto exploring this major theme. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.26">
<s n="s1.1;p12.26">Studying the chapter 'On repenting' specifically, the idea of repentance links to the on-running theme of 'Nature' as well and to the way in which Montaigne feels people should act: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'Grieving for...my natural frailty.... that should not be called repenting any more than my grieving at not being an angel or Cato. My doings are ruled by what I am and are in harmony with how I was made'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.015"/>. </quote>

<p n="p13.26">
<s n="s1.3;p13.26">It is clear that the writer, who 'rarely repents', does not think just because of natural defects one should have to repent and feel bad as if the character flaw, were a 'sin'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.26">This is an example of the preface subtly setting up links to the previously mentioned themes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.26">The reader, throughout the essays and certainly in the two chosen chapters, makes a mental link back to the preface as ideas are aroused once again in the text following 'To the Reader'. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p16.26">One can be deceitful and hide their true self. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.26">As mentioned in the preface, Montaigne 'wants to be seen... without striving', so clearly is against such 'deliberate' deception and does not agree with the gap between appearance and reality. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.26">In the recently mentioned chapter, 'On repenting' Montaigne expresses his approval of showing your true self 'in your own home', 'there is no striving there, no artifice'. </s>

<p n="p17.26">
<s n="s1.2;p17.26">Clearly truth and deceit are major concerns in the chapter aptly named 'On liars'. </s>

<p n="p18.26">
<s n="s1.3;p18.26">This claim enhances the reader's trust in Montaigne as he goes on to describe his own 'grotesquely faulty' memory. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.26">He also blames a good memory for being the cause of unnecessary 'chatter' as 'it is easier to draw on the storehouse of memory than to find something original to say'<ref target="BAWE_3108b-ftnote.020"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.26">The use of an extended metaphor of a 'silly horse' is at work to relay Montaigne's point more effectively: </s>

<s n="s1.2;p19.26">Another notable point is that in the preface, as said before, Montaigne compares himself to a 'native' who appears 'wholly naked'. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.26">This enhances the put-forward idea of his disclosure and full openness to the reader creating a stronger bond between reader and writer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.26">
<s n="s1.1;p20.26">Therefore, as can be observed, the preface sets up the basis for the exploration of lies and deceit in the direct sense but furthermore evokes a feeling of trust from the reader. </s>

<p n="p21.26">
<s n="s1.9;p21.26">Now we must look at the final and most obvious theme of the <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> that of 'the Self'. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p22.26">In the earlier chapter of study, the phrase 'experience has often shown me that' exemplifies the idea that in discussing oneself an observation on the general nature of mankind can be made. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p23.26">Digression in later chapters was more common as Montaigne became more confident with detailing his own personal views and opinions. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.26">The contrast of the two chapters 'On liars' of Book I and 'On repenting' of Book III concerning the habit of digressing is apparent and supports this idea. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.26">'On liars' is basically strict to the point but does discuss subsidiary themes from this major one such as 'memory'. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.26">However, in the later chapter he does not strictly focus on 'repenting' but drifts off the subject and explores man's 'nature' in general and 'old age'. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.26">This digression perhaps signifies the inconclusiveness of such a vast subject, which is not helped by the ever-changing nature of humans. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.26">Montaigne states in the opening of 'On repenting', 'I am unable to stabilize my subject'. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.26">The human 'portrait' does 'vary' making a conclusion 'impossible' to 'grasp'. </s>

<p n="p24.26">
<s n="s1.5;p24.26">As the years passed the nature of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> became increasingly personal. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.26">Self-portraiture became more important as can be seen in the difference between the A, B and C passages. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.26">C passages, the text of 1592, were much more personal than the earlier A passages, the text of 1580. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.26">However, critics believed even in the 1580 passages Montaigne's 'self' shines through. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.26">Returning to Montaigne's tendency to digress, in the chapter 'On repenting', one can see in this later chapter the more personal and free-flowing quality of the writing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.26">
<s n="s1.9;p25.26">As can be seen, the preface, 'To the Reader', sets up expectations for the reader and introduces them to the important themes explored throughout the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> and more specifically in the chosen chapters of study. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p25.26">In hindsight, one can observe the subtle links the preface makes with what is to follow and therefore adds to our own appreciation of the essays being studied, which conveys the importance of this unusual introduction. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p25.26">Both of the explored chapters 'On liars' and 'On repenting' concern most of the themes dealt with in the preface, therefore we, the reader, can value the ideas more as we have been introduced to them at an earlier stage. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p25.26">The preface almost acts as a simple guide or outline to the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> and helps the reader's mind focus on the ideas Montaigne believes are most important. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p25.26">Montaigne also does not stray from what he promises the reader he will do in the preface about his set wish to explore himself. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p25.26">However, he does obviously digress and discusses related themes and ideas mainly dealing with the nature of man in relation to his own thoughts and 'experiences'. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p25.26">Due to the conversational and trusting style used by Montaigne so early on as in the preface, the reader is more inclined to agree with his own personal beliefs, as the relationship between reader and writer is immediately fairly strong. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p25.26">After reading the preface therefore, whilst studying the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, we refer back to the introduction and perhaps it influences our own appreciation of themes dealt with later on. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p25.26">Are we subconsciously influenced in making up our own minds due to the innocuous style and apparent friendliness of 'To the Reader'? </s>
