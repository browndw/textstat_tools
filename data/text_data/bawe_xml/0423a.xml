<head rend="bold">INTRODUCTION</head>
<p n="p1.33">
<s n="s1.1;p1.33">This treatise has been prepared on behalf of Action Against the Suffering of the South (AASS), a civil society network, for submission to the organisers of the next World Social Forum (WSF), for their consideration during the WSF agenda-setting process. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.33">
<s n="s1.2;p2.33">The treatise outlines four related propositions that AASS recommends be placed on the agenda for the next WSF, for the purpose of encouraging the participants (whether alternative globalisation movements (AGMs), civil society organisations (CSOs) or otherwise) to adopt a platform of action that AASS considers will lead to greater effectiveness in the advancement of global justice, as evidenced through equitable improvements in the quality of life for people living in the deprived communities of the South and the North. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.33">Whilst the influences on civil society activism, including political, economic and social factors, cannot be compartmentalised, the primary focus of each of the propositions is on the relationship between law and civil society activism. </s>

<head rend="bold">THE CONTEXT</head>
<p n="p3.33">
<s n="s1.3;p3.33">Prior to detailing the propositions, it is useful to consider briefly the context of, and motivation for, the treatise; namely, the present uncertainty concerning the promise of the WSF's slogan "Another World Is Possible". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.33">This uncertainty is apparent in the recurring line of criticism that suggests that the WSF is chaotic, disorganised and lacks a coherent vision<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.001"/>, with only a common enemy, namely hegemonic neoliberalist-led globalisation(s), to bind the myriad disparate participants of the WSF, rather than a clear platform of action from which to address the social inequalities and injustice that exist throughout the world.<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.002"/> Beck notes that the global justice or anti-globalisation movement is "probably the most active component of global civil society at the moment. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.33">Yet its voices do not translate into concrete policies or generalised public concern."<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.33">In response to such criticism, it has been suggested that the specific WSF events themselves "should not be seen as the answer to the challenges of our time; [but] should be seen as a valuable part of the answer(s) with a very distinctive contribution. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p6.33">This proposition suggests a reframing of the concept of 'law', which may be applied by any of the WSF participants, regardless of their particular thematic focuses or geographic locations, to engage with law in a globalising world, informed by a concern for social justice and human development. </s>

<p n="p7.33">
<s n="s1.4;p7.33">The concept of 'law' is generally presented and understood as apolitical, benign and relatively unchanging. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p7.33">Research has indicated, among other things: the imperialism of international law, as demonstrated through the politics of recognition which created an ongoing project of colonisation and an international law constituted by unequal violence;<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.007"/> the changing social reality in developing countries, and the corresponding expansion of the reach of international law, for example as a result of the challenge put forward by the New International Economic Order;<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.008"/> the embracing by international institutions of a neo-liberal agenda, which is geared towards promoting and realising the interests of an "emerging transnational capitalist class in the international system to the disadvantage of subaltern classes in the first and third worlds".<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.009"/> Thus it becomes apparent that the concept of law is in fact not unproblematic. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p8.33">Further, a central element to the dominant understanding of law is the assumed coinciding of social and state boundaries, making the state the defining feature of the world legal order, and consequently limiting the application of law to a national/international framework.<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.010"/> However, in today's world, the state is transcended (although not lost as a significant actor<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.011"/>) in many areas of political, economic and social relations where interests, identities, aspirations and languages of normative understandings derive from non-state sources. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.33">Given that many of the issues key to global justice concerns (from human rights discourses to cross-border economic relations, from global security policies to environmental consciousness, from globally connected financial and regulatory bodies to transnational anti-systemic movements) are now influenced less and less by hegemonic discourses and control mechanisms of statist law, it appears that state sovereignty stands challenged as the foundational principle of legal imagination, as it proves difficult if not impossible to attempt to challenge transnational issues using a state-centred discourse.<ref target="BAWE_0423a-ftnote.012"/> </s>
