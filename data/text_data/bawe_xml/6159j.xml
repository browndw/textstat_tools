<s n="s1.4;p1.36">Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a technique used to solve fluid flow problems. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.36">Rather than using experimental methods, that are expensive and time consuming, CFD can be used effectively to predict the real life solution. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.36">CFD is carried out on digital computers that use algorithms to solve a set of indeterminate equations called the Navier-Stokes equations. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.36">These partial differential equations where derived in the early nineteenth century and are used to describe the processes of momentum, heat and mass transfer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.36">
<s n="s1.6;p2.36">In the 1960's CFD was born, even though it was a very primitive form. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.36">It was not until the mid 1970's that the complex algorithms needed for CFD began to be understood. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.36">By the early 1980's CFD programs where available but they required a high amount of knowledge of fluid dynamics and time to set up the simulations. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.36">They also required very powerful computers. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.36">The CFD industry rapidly expanded in the 1990's and through to the 21 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> century. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.36">CFD programs can now import complex models from CAD programs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.36">
<s n="s1.2;p3.36">CFD is used by many different sectors of industry, these include automotive, building services, electronics, energy, medical and numerous others. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.36">It aids the design of comfortable and safe working environments, efficient equipment, high performance vehicles and maximum yields from chemical reactions. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.36">FDM is the simplest of the three methods. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.36">It is based on a grid of nodes dependent on time and distance. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.36">It uses the Taylor series to predict the condition at a node based on the adjacent nodes one time-step behind it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.36">
<s n="s1.2;p6.36">FEM is based on the same principles as FDM but instead of a uniform grid being used it uses a non-regular grid. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.36">This gives a higher accuracy as complex boundary conditions can be modelled. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.36">
<s n="s1.2;p7.36">FVM is a combination of both FDM and FEM. It simulates a small volume at each node then uses divergence theorem to convert them to a surface integral. </s>
