<s n="s1.6;p1.25">Eugenics was described by Charles B. Davenport, a leading member of the American field, as being "the science of the improvement of the human race by better breeding." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s2.6;p1.25">In short, eugenics theoretically aims at the improvement the characteristics of man via the study of heredity and the subsequent application of this knowledge to human reproduction. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.25">Thus in practice this entails curbing reproduction between those with "inferior" characteristics (negative eugenics) and encouraging it among those possessing valuable qualities (positive eugenics). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.25">Such eugenic science was practically legislated for in many states of the U.S.A. and in Germany. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.25">Many U.S. states had laws for the sterilisation of the "feebleminded", for example, including epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals, and the 1924 Immigration Restriction Act prevented people of certain ethnic backgrounds entering the country. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.25">Nazi Germany followed suit during the 1930s where the Law on Preventing Hereditarily Ill Progeny called for the "hereditarily sick" to be sterilised and later, bringing ethnicity into eugenics, the Nuremburg Laws prevented inter-marriage or sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.5;p2.25">The memory of what happened as a result of the German National Socialist eugenic policies has perhaps tended to obscure the history of the eugenics movement as a whole. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.25">Historians have tended to look upon eugenics movements as national phenomena, ignoring the mass of evidence suggesting international collaboration on both academic and practical enforcement issues.<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.002"/> The Final Solution devised in Germany was the most overt and horrific enforcement of negative eugenics in killing thousands of Jews with allegedly "inferior" racial characteristics, but it is not the only example of the practical application of eugenics. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.25">One must remember that the eugenics movement began not in Germany but in Great Britain and the U.S.A., and the latter was the first country of the world to possess laws imposing the application of eugenic policy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.25">Thus in studying how it was possible for Germany to reach the point at which their program of systematic killing could be designed, I feel it is important for the historian to consider what outside influence the country came under. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.25">As Great Britain rapidly distanced herself from the German racial hygienists after Hitler's takeover, it is the U.S. whose influence is of most relevance and interest. </s>

<p n="p3.25">
<s n="s1.8;p3.25">It is claimed that the origin of eugenics can be traced back to ancient Greece<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.003"/> but its modern form draws mainly from Darwinian theory. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.25">The idea of evolution being a process of natural selection, where only the strongest survive, is essential to the basis of this science. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.25">Evolutionary theory shows how the weaker elements of any species are eliminated via the course of heredity in that more of those with "superior" characteristics will survive to pass these on. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.25">It is this natural elimination, however, that the human species has been able to overcome as a result of medicine, charity and technology. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.25">Early eugenicists thus believed that human progress was being hindered by the need for the strong to take care of those "inferior" elements that existed as remnants of modern society. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.25">As their understanding was that humans gained almost all of their characteristics through the process of heredity, regardless of environmental factors, a simple solution to this problem existed. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.25">By curbing the reproduction of those possessing qualities of weakness and encouraging it among the more superior, continued progress could be assured. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.25">In practice this meant the use of such things as marriage restriction, sterilisation, permanent imprisonment of defective individuals, or in the German case, euthanasia. </s>

<p n="p4.25">
<s n="s1.5;p4.25">As with almost all processes, the eugenics movement was affected by race, class and other forms of prejudice existing in society. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.25">Thus it was not only the medically defective, those with hereditary illness for example, that became part of the scope of eugenic aims, but also those sharing "inferior" qualities of race and class, and the asocial. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.25">The extent to which such prejudices affected the progress of eugenics differed in each respective country as a result of the specific social, cultural and economic conditions in existence, as Daniel Kevles has pointed out<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.25">Thus in Great Britain the main concern was the rapid growth of the working classes, whereas in Germany and America in particular it was racial hatred that governed eugenic progress. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.25">Perhaps it is for this reason why it came to be the U.S. that presented the greatest influence on German policies of racial hygiene. </s>

<p n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.4;p5.25">Although the American movement first began to take shape around the 1870s, it became most influential from the turn of the century up until the 1930s, when Nazi cruelties began to overshadow and denigrate the movement as a whole. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.25">Official approval for the sterilisation of "feebleminded" individuals was given in many states throughout this period, and it was also at this time that racist undertones began to move toward the forefront in U.S. immigration restrictions.<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.005"/> However links between the eugenics movement in the U.S. and Nazi Germany have been suggested right into World War II, hence the decision to study this connection through until 1945. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.25">My aim is to examine the extent to which it can be claimed that developments in the American eugenics movement influenced the shape of German and later Nazi racial hygiene. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.25">There are many ways in which this influence might be demonstrated, including evidence of the use of the U.S. as a model in Germany, contact between influential individuals in the movement and the discussion of claims from both sides of the importance of the U.S. </s>

</note>
<p n="p6.25">
<s n="s1.6;p6.25">The traditional view of the historical relationship between the German and American eugenics movements is one of increasing distance. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.25">Historians tended, at least until the 1980s, to suggest that only a small proportion of U.S. eugenicists continued to support racial hygiene in Germany after the Nazi takeover. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.25">They argue instead that during the 1930s the two countries followed entirely different pathways, one obscuring the scientific basis of eugenics while the other became increasingly focused upon this aspect.<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.006"/> The suggestion here is one entirely linked to the use of eugenics in terms of race: that during this period the scientific basis believed to uphold racism became unpinned so that it no longer had "scientific respectability"<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.25">Thus only Nazi Germany, a country devoted to racism over and above that of scientific eugenics itself, could maintain such a program of beliefs. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.25">Those historians who admitted to continued U.S. support for German policy generally only did so on the basis of this being a minority position among American eugenicists as an entire group. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.25">Kevles, for example, identified just two American eugenicist supporters of Nazi Germany<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.008"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.25">However, more recently historians have begun in attempts to illustrate the definite involvement of U.S. eugenicists in Nazi policies. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.25">The extent to which it is seen that America influenced German racial hygiene has significantly risen and thus one is now capable of making a more balanced judgement on this issue. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.25">KÃ¼hl suggests that part of the reason why historians in the past failed to see the significance of U.S. involvement was because they tended to focus on sources provided by the American Eugenics Society.<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.009"/> Given the eventual outcome of German racial hygiene it is hardly surprising that the Americans might attempt to downplay the extent of their involvement. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.25">By also studying German sources and their claims to have been influenced by the American model, the interaction between these two countries is more clearly revealed. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p8.25">Such claims then make up an important part of the evidence for the case that the U.S. did have a significant influence on German racial hygiene, and they are abundant in existence. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.25">Before the implementation of the Law on Preventing Hereditarily Ill Progeny was passed in 1933, Bonhoeffer, the Berlin professor of psychiatry for the Prussian Racial Hygiene Committee, recommended thorough investigation into those already in existence in many U.S. states. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.25">German eugenicists reportedly stated that they were indebted to the Americans, particularly with reference to the report written by Gosney and Popenoe on the Californian program<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.25">The idea seems to have been widespread that the American example was precisely what Germany ought to emulate, and its reception and conditions were important in shaping Germany's own laws. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.25">In illustration, the pointing out of heavy opposition faced in the U.S. was critical in delaying the implementation of such laws in Germany<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.011"/> and examples of cruelty meant that the Reich Health Office initially advised against compulsion in enforcement<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.012"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p9.25">The favoured method of sterilisation as the means to practically apply eugenic science also reflects an American trend. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.25">Back in 1914 the American Henry H. Goddard, the man who coined the term "moron" to describe those with mental deficiencies, stated that "If both parents are feeble-minded all the children will be feeble-minded. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.25">It is obvious that such matings should not be allowed." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s4.7;p9.25">Like Davenport he believed that the "feeble-minded" should be prevented from having children via laws enforcing their sterilisation and preventing marriage. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.25">It is from such examples that the Nazis drew in their own sterilisation legislation, and the Nuremburg law preventing marriage between Aryans and non-Aryans show distinct similarities to those in many U.S. states. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.25">German academic journals in fact tended to argue that laws in America preventing miscegenation between blacks and whites were in fact far <hi rend="italic">stricter</hi> that those in their own country.<ref target="BAWE_0252n-ftnote.014"/> Barry Mehler has been the most vocal historian with respect to such similarities and insists that the Nazi program of the 1930s was directly modelled on the U.S. example. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p11.25">H.H.
