<s n="s5.6;p2.29">The term "serial" is included because the symbioses were established serially, one before the other: first spirochetes as undulipodia, then aerobic bacteria became mitochondria, and finally cyanobacteria became chloroplasts <hi rend="sup">13</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p29.29">The evidence above strongly suggests that organelles were arisen from the endosymbiotic uptake of free-living bacteria by eukaryotic host cells. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.29">As the host eukaryotic cell and symbionts developed a mutually beneficial existence, both entities lost their ability to function without the other, which would explain why neither mitochondria nor chloroplasts have been shown to be able to live on their own when isolated from the eukaryotic cell <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.29">As Margulis and Sagan said one of their books, "Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking." </s>
