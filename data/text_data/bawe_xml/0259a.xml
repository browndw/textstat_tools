<s n="s2.6;p1.25">In some 1600 pages of published material, representing barely more than half of its projected size, Musil's unfinished work presents the reader with an incredibly complex and highly philosophical contribution to modern literature. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.25">Written over a period of two decades, the book reflects Musil's own philosophical and spiritual ambitions, offered in the story of its hero, Ulrich. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.25">The setting is Vienna, in the year just prior to the commencing of World War I. An iconic picture of the modern world, a wide cast of characters surrounded by the accelerating advances of impersonal technology variously respond to the apparent lack of a meaningful principle by which they can anchor their lives. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.25">Ulrich, a gifted man of remarkable intelligence, but mirroring the formlessness of the world around him, finds himself completely removed from any definite construction of his own identity, and so exists as the man without qualities. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.25">Setting aside his career as a mathematician, he decides to take a 'leave from life' (Urlaub vom Leben) for one year in order to determine that which modern man has lost: the right way of living. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.25">With the eventual reunion with his estranged sister Agathe, Ulrich begins to uncover the true meaning of morality in a mystical state simply called the 'Other Condition'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.25">It is in the unfinished and highly elusive elaboration of this Other Condition that we are offered a glimpse at Ulrich's (and Musil's) utopian vision. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.25">But although Musil's death prevented the publication of the sections that would deal most directly with the exact nature of this Condition and the revolutionary morality it could give rise to, the richness of the finished prose allows for a great deal to be argued for convincingly. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.25">This is in part because beyond the positive characterizations that we find almost exclusively in the third book of the novel, the reader can - from the very beginning - be instructed by the powerful negative current of brilliant satire and irony which Musil employs in order to vividly portray how <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to live. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.25">What I want to suggest is that despite the ultimately speculative character of any account of what Musil's mysticism would truly be like and what kind of work it would do, there are interesting and valuable insights to be gained through an analysis of those 'characters gone wrong' with which Ulrich interacts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.25">
<s n="s1.4;p3.25">Now, to take a careful look at each and every 'character gone wrong' would be an endeavour far too lengthy to attempt within the space of the present essay; the victims of Musil's satirizing are many indeed. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.25">The focus must be narrowed to those which allow for the most specific and detailed comparisons and contrasts to be made. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.25">In what follows I will attempt to clarify some of the crucial elements of Ulrich's mystical experiences through a study of two secondary but vital characters: Moosbrugger and Clarisse. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.25">By noting the way in which they <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Ulrich are described by Musil as undergoing an abnormal relationship with the space of their own bodies and the world surrounding them, the way to a deeper understanding of what Musil was intending with the Other Condition is made available to us. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.25">
<s n="s1.4;p4.25">The problem of congruency between interior and exterior experience is introduced early on. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.25">We meet Ulrich in the second chapter, as he stands alone, separated by the glass of his window, gazing out into the street and its many bustling forms. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.25">Not only does his physical position relative to the city introduce a divide, but his playful exercise in attempting to bring into mathematical terms all that happens outside, "trying to calculate the incalculable,"<ref target="BAWE_0259a-ftnote.002"/> highlights the incompatibility between the personal world and the social world. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.25">Beyond this basic opposition among individuals, Musil also thematizes the conflict arising between reason and emotion, or logic and intuition, or the abstract and the practical. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.25">However, not being satisfied with merely lamenting the growing divide between the individual and its supposedly meaningful involvement in the social whole, Musil offers, with the Other Condition, the possibility of a <hi rend="italic">synthesis</hi> of the two spheres. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p7.25">That the Other Condition is illustrated by Musil in terms of these strange spatial experiences is interesting in its own right. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.25">What is even more interesting, and perhaps more valuable with respect to the explanatory work it can do, is the fact that Clarisse and Moosbrugger, both highly deviant from Ulrich and the synthesis he is trying to effect, each have experiences which are described by Musil in just the same way as what Ulrich undergoes in fleeting glimpses of the Other Condition. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.25">Being united in this way, we can, with close attention to what is problematic about Musil's two 'mystical counterexamples,' get a clearer picture of what the mystical experience of the Other Condition is actually like. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.25">Before our discussion of the Other Condition can begin in earnest, it is important to take note first of the nature of the peculiar experiences had by Moosbrugger and Clarisse. </s>

It was sometimes very blurred. The visions came from outside, but at the same time a glimmer of observation told him that they nevertheless came out of himself. The important point was that it was not in the least important whether something was outside or inside: for him it was like clear water on both sides of a transparent glass wall [...] He thought better than other people, because he thought outside and inside. <ref target="BAWE_0259a-ftnote.011"/>

<s n="s6.8;p10.25">Fiercely denying to have a child by the husband she finds increasingly repulsive, she becomes more and more dramatically attached to pieces of Nietzsche's thought (his works having been a wedding present from Ulrich), and is convinced that she must give birth to the great redeemer of mankind.<ref target="BAWE_0259a-ftnote.014"/> Her fantasies and experiences become more elaborate and intense, and alongside this grows her fascination with Moosbrugger. </s>
