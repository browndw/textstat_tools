<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.18">
<s n="s1.1;p11.18">We are also assuming that the variable cost of producing 1 kg of fine &amp; medium denier to be £0.88 and £0.74 respectively. </s>

<head rend="bold">IMPLICATIONS OF THE DRAFTED MIX PRODUCTION</head>
<p n="p12.18">
<s n="s1.5;p12.18">Based on the constraint given, the best mix production we could find out for the next production is 3000 kgs for fine denier and 12000 kgs. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.18">The contribution we get out of this mix is £8700. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.18">The production mix for January came out short by £120. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.18">We soon found out from the sensitivity test that should additional hours allocated for Spinning process, not more than 50 hours, there will be more contribution to be reaped. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.18">The maximum amount of extra contribution we could gain is £1500 as every extra hour spent will result in an extra £50 contribution. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.18">
<s n="s1.4;p13.18">Our report shows that time available for Draw-Twisting, 1600 hours, are not fully used as there are 550 hours not used. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.18">As compared to the production mix in January, there is 730 available hours left unused. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.18">Like in the Spinning process in the month, any additional hour spent on Draw-Twisting process will not help gain any extra contribution. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.18">Unless the company wanted it left unused, I suggest Miss Sue should use it for any by-product or joint product possible with the availability. </s>

<head rend="bold">IMPACT OF PRICE VARIATION</head>
<p n="p14.18">
<s n="s1.2;p14.18">By assuming that the variable cost remains unchanged, price changes in the either deniers may or may not change the optimum mix production. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.18">Based on our sensitivity report we believe that the suggested mix production will remain optimum: for changes of not more than 1.0 of the current contribution and not less than 0.05 below the current contribution of medium denier. </s>

<p n="p15.18">
<s n="s1.15;p15.18">The customer offering to buy 5000 kgs of fine denier at £1.82 has exceeded the range for our formulated optimal mix production; hence our formulation is no longer in use for this purpose. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p15.18">We have formulated a new mix of production of 5000 kgs and 8000 kgs of fine and medium denier respectively; the total contribution is £8700. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p15.18">Unless Miss Sue has a better use of the unused time, 850 hours, which is more than the earlier formulations, the contribution and everything else is about the same. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p15.18">Assuming that all production will be sold every month, the cushion provided is insignificant. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p15.18">Based on Graph 1.0, the forecast is corresponded by the actual result most of the time. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p15.18">When the forecast shows a rise in price it is most likely that there will be a rise in the actual price. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p15.18">There is no exception this time around. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p15.18">I strongly believe the actual price will rise as suggested by the forecast with a rise of £0.01. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p15.18">The average magnitude of the rise and fall is around £0.06. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p15.18">That being said, I believe the rise could well top the offered price, if not, equivalent to it. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p15.18">Based on these analyses I would advice that Miss Sue be patient enough to wait for the actual price revelation. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p15.18">Even if the price falls, it would not be as big an impact as a rise because the trend is going up and the gap is widening between the actual and forecast price. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p15.18">As the table suggested, the accuracy of the forecast is questionable with an average differing rate of £0.06 which is not negligible. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p15.18">But the trend of the forecast has in history been corresponding to the trend of the actual price most of the time. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p15.18">The question here is whether this would be accompanied with a big or insignificant increase. </s>

<head rend="bold">CONCLUSION</head>
<p n="p16.18">
<s n="s1.4;p16.18">Miss Sue decision to pre-sell to vendors at market ruling price is risky and unstable. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.18">I would recommend that Miss Sue come to an agreement with all the major vendors or loyal clients of the transaction price of the yarns. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.18">This would write off any uncertainties in the production mix. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.18">Should Miss Sue decided to stick on her way, It is advisable to spent more time on the Spinning process and divert the unused time from the Draw-Twisting process to other production. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.18">
<s n="s1.1;p17.18">The proposal is attractive but due to the trend of the price, I believe Miss Sue should reject it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.18">
<s n="s1.1;p18.18">Finally, the marketing department should review their accuracy and increase their scale research. </s>
