<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.14">
<s n="s1.3;p1.14">The epic poem, the Aeneid, is considered not only Virgil's greatest work, but perhaps the greatest of Rome's Augustan Age. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.14">Written during the final period of Virgil's life, it follows the Trojan hero Aeneas, who overcomes many obstacles to found Rome and fulfil his destiny. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.14">Based on the Iliad and Odyssey, the Aeneid draws many a flattering comparison with Augustus and Aeneas, and makes much of their shared descent from Venus. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.2;p2.14">Propertius, an upper class love-elegist was also writing at this time, sometimes considered subversive. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.14">The extract, 1.1-8, is from a poem typical of his sophisticated style. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.1;p3.14">Both passages are concerned with love, namely its effect on people. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.3;p4.14">The first extract, from Book Four of the Aeneid, presents love as a destructive force. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.14">Dido has fallen in love with Aeneas, a situation orchestrated by Venus. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.14">The goddess, wishing to protect Aeneas from Juno's wrath, manipulates the Carthaginian queen mercilessly throughout Book Four. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.14">
<s n="s1.5;p5.14">Right from the start, the reader is aware that for Dido, the story cannot end happily, as Aeneas is destined to leave Carthage. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.14">In Book One, Jupiter confirmed that Aeneas would succeed in founding Rome; a destiny that doesn't leave room for a Carthaginian consort. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.14">Virgil uses syntax with negative connotations to make the transgressive nature of Dido's love very clear; it is described as a 'wound' and a 'fire biting within her', almost parasitic in the way it saps her life force. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.14">Virgil pinpoints aspects of obsessive love; driven to distraction from her duties to her people, she is convinced this 'heaven-born' hero can do no wrong. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.14">It is also one-sided at this point, as Aeneas' emotions towards Dido aren't mentioned at all in this extract. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.14">
<s n="s1.3;p6.14">Dido is aware of how ridiculous her situation is, that she loves 'this stranger' Aeneas, and has to watch herself fall victim to this madness. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.14">Aside from the fact that Dido and Aeneas are simply not meant to be together, Virgil implies that love is a bad force overall. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.14">Dido suffers under the power of 'love's disquiet', disturbed by haunting dreams, allowed no relief from this unwanted feeling day or night. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.14">
<s n="s1.4;p7.14">She is succumbing to, and being destroyed by what the Romans called 'furor', a state in which a person was controlled by their extreme emotions and lost their sense of rational thought ('ratio'). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.14">Furor was considered dangerous, and although Virgil presents emotions like rage as appropriate in the battles of later books, they must be balanced with ratio. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.14">In Book Two, Venus has to step in to stop Aeneas from killing Helen in an angry fit, and remind him of his duties to his family and the city (pietas); 'Why this raging passion?... </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.14">Will you not first go and see where you have left your father?' <ref target="BAWE_6182b-ftnote.001"/> </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_6182b-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">D.West (2003: 42) </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.14">
<s n="s1.2;p8.14">So, for Dido to be in love is for her to be irrational, out of control, neglectful of her duty and consumed by passion. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.14">This was exactly the type of behaviour Augustus did his best to discourage among Roman citizens, especially the women. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.14">
<s n="s1.2;p9.14">Aeneas' passion for Dido/submission to furor is depicted as nothing but wrong by Virgil. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.14">It keeps him from his destiny, and he has to be twice reminded of it by Mercury, who chides him for 'idling your time away in the land of Libya' <ref target="BAWE_6182b-ftnote.002"/> If left unchecked, this furor could have jeopardised the future of Rome. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_6182b-ftnote.002">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">D.West (2003: 77) </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p10.14">
<s n="s1.4;p10.14">It should however be remembered that Virgil's purpose in writing the Aeneid was not to present a view of love, romantic or otherwise, but to create a great Roman epic poem as propaganda for Augustus. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.14">It constantly reminds the reader of the heroic origins of Rome, and frequently refers to Augustus' divine heritage. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.14">Love is not a major theme or driving force in the poem, and only features prominently in Book Four, as a detour from the important matters of founding and protecting Rome. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.14">The inclusion of such a negative, sinister portrayal of love in the extract succeeds in creating a sense of foreboding for the reader, and adds to the drama of Book Four. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.14">
<s n="s1.7;p11.14">Though the second extract is on a less epic scale than that of the Aeneid, it too depicts love as a powerful force. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.14">The voice of the poem is, like Dido, lowered by love, 'trampled', made 'pitiable' and humiliated. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.14">He personifies love, presenting it as a 'he', a figure with the might to reduce him. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.14">The love-struck narrator is driven to a 'frenzy' and lives 'without taking thought', obsessed much as Dido was. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.14">Yet in this extract, love isn't forced on the narrator by the gods, rather he is infected by its 'contagion'. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.14">Much has been made of Propertius' subversive stance, who, as an upper-class Roman, was expected to be unmoved by love. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.14">His use of extreme language and imagery highlights how atypical his situation is- making the poem all the more emotional. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.4;p12.14">He makes use of a feature of elegy, militia amoris, 'to capture with her eyes...' </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.14">Interestingly, the one captured in this extract is a man; once under love's spell he is an abnormality in Roman society, a male citizen acting as slave to a woman. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.14">Although the idea of servitium amoris was another common feature of love elegies, Propertius makes it clear that this 'perverse' state of affairs is disapproved of by the gods. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.14">He himself doesn't seem happy with his helplessness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.3;p13.14">While these ideas of slavery and infection don't coincide with today's idea of romance, we should consider what the Augustan idea of romance was. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.14">Perhaps in an age of the 'stiff upper lip', the only romantic view was an illicit, violent, extreme one. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.14">If this was so, Propertius' unpleasant, 'perverse' sense of being in love may have seemed romantic at the time. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.4;p14.14">Both Roman poets suggest that to be in love is to suffer, and be manipulated by forces out of your control. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.14">In Dido's case, love is the means by which cruel gods get what they want, another hardship humans can do little to counteract. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.14">Propertius is equally vulnerable to love's force, but presents it as an affliction with consequences contrary to Augustan social norms. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.14">Although the love described here is not romantic in today's sense (i.e. a positive, life-affirming force), a clear sense of the darker side of love is presented by both extracts. </s>
