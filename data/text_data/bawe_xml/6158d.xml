<s n="s1.1;p1.120">This report is based on a hypothetical case study based around a Berkshire farm, the specification is given below: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English" rend="italic">"You are the owner and manager for a 180 ha farm in the county of Berkshire. The basis of its farming activities has been milk production, and at one time over 300 cows were milked. Latterly the number of cows have been reduced, but it remains a dairy farm. In addition to the dairy cows, there are also some sheep and some cereal production. Staff include a dairy herdsman, tractor driver, and your 19 year old son, currently at university, who helps out during his vacation". </quote>
<p n="p2.120">
<s n="s1.3;p2.120">In this report I have made the following assumptions; that the manager and two workers are not in a position where they will be retiring soon, and the son will be returning to work on the farm from university in the next year. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.120">The farm is owned outright and the manager is working on the land as well as carrying out office work. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.120">My final assumption is that the farm is in a financially secure situation but is looking to increase profits. </s>

</p>
<p n="p5.120">
<s n="s1.1;p5.120">In this section I will look at the technical, conceptual and human skills required by a manager in the agricultural sector, I will also describe the informational, interpersonal and decisional roles and how they link to the management tasks. </s>

<p n="p7.120">
<s n="s1.3;p7.120">I shall identify the main aspects of the external environment and identify the main figures in the task environment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.120">I will also use the PEST framework to examine other forces that affect the business. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.120">The stakeholders of the business are also identified in this section. </s>

<p n="p13.120">
<s n="s1.1;p13.120">I will use this section to explain the differences between budgeting and financial analysis and why they are important to the business, and I will detail the types of analysis that can be used to measure financial and organisational performance. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Section one</head>
<p n="p14.120">
<s n="s1.3;p14.120">A person in this position will need to fulfil all the management parts, as they will be the functional, general, line, staff and most probably the task manager although this type of management is unlikely to be needed on the farm. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.120">As the farm is self owned there is no one to report to, or whose requests and targets have to be meet, so it would be up to the manager to run the business on a daily basis and then to review the business on a regular basis and check that the management that is being implemented is being successful. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.120">The manger could delegate certain sectors of the farm to employees, such as having the herdsman responsible for the dairy unit, and he would then need to report to the manger as he would be the herdsman general and line manager, as well as his employer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.120">
<s n="s1.5;p15.120">The manager in this role would need to have many conceptual skills as they are responsible for the entire business, the conceptual skills needed are thinking, information processing, planning and decision making. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.120">The planning will be needed to effectively manage the crops and livestock, factors such as when to drill, apply fertilisers and chemical sprays and when harvest will take place. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.120">This will need to be planned to ensure there is the staff to carry out all the tasks, and that the materials are on site when the job needs to be carried out. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.120">The ability to process information is also important, what is grown and the livestock kept will depend on current and predicted prices so the ability to read the information on these issues is essential to choosing a profitable venture. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.120">The ability to make decisions will help with choosing what crops will be grown and what livestock keep and how much time should be spent on certain tasks, but these decisions can only be made in conjunction with the other conceptual skills of thinking about what tasks need to be done, planning them and processing information to make informed decisions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.120">
<s n="s1.2;p16.120">As the sole manager of the business the person in this role would need to lead the workforce, this will involve directing them on what work needs to be done and when and most probably leading by example as the manager of this business will probably also have to work on the farm. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.120">This is linked to communication, it is essential that the person in this role has good communication skills as they will need to set the goals of what is trying to be achieved by the work carried out, and they will also need to convey work and tasks to employees clearly, this is especially important in this working environment, as carrying out a task wrong can have very large consequences that may affect the survival of the business such as the spraying off, or cutting of the wrong crop. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.120">
<s n="s1.3;p17.120">Other human skills will also be needed, such as the ability to co-ordinate, this will include the co-ordination of staff, the manager would have to ensure that he has the man power to carry out all the tasks and that the business is never under or over staffed, this may mean that extra workers will need to hired during busy times such as harvest. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.120">As the only manager, the person in this role would also be responsible for resolving any issues the workforce have, this could be difficult in this situation because it is such a small workforce the manager is likely to friends with all the employees, it will also be difficult if his son was involved and what have to act as though he had no connection to any of the employees. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.120">The person in this role would also need to be self motivated as they will have no one to motivate them, they would </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.120">
<s n="s1.1;p18.120">also be responsible for motivating the staff, so it is essential that they never loose sight of the end goal or it could end up affecting the workforce as well. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.120">
<s n="s1.3;p19.120">The third management skill that would be needed by someone in this position is that of technical skill, this means having the ability to understand the work of the business and how it is carried out and be proficient in the skills required. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.120">In a farming business this is vitally important, as the manager will probably have to do manual labour as well as doing the office work. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.120">They are also most likely to be the main source of relief staff to cover the workers when they are ill or on holiday, it is therefore essential that they poses some basic knowledge of all the farming activities so that cover can be provided. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.120">
<s n="s1.6;p20.120">The person in this position would be responsible for carrying out many informational, interpersonal and decisional roles due to the fact that they are the only manager and the owner of the business. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p20.120">The informational roles that will apply are, monitoring information, being able to find the information they need and read and understand it, this is relevant to this job as information on the industry will constantly need reviewing, such as the price of inputs and outputs, predicted changes in the industry and new techniques and technology that is developed that could increase efficiency. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.120">The farm accounts will also need reviewing regularly to check that the business is not going to make a loss, budgets will also need to be set and this will not be possible unless information is known on predicted price for inputs and outputs, and what new machines or equipment will need to be bought. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.120">The role of a disseminator is not particularly relevant to this role as it is a small business, and there is no owner to present too as the owner and manager are the same person. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.120">However if any information was to be told to the employees it what be the responsibility of this person. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p20.120">The role of spokesperson is the responsibility of the person in this role; they would be the one to represent the business to other companies and organisations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.120">
<s n="s1.3;p21.120">The person is the position will have to lead and liaise with people, these are the interpersonal roles. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.120">As the manager and owner the person would be responsible for directing and motivating the staff, and also motivating themselves, as the person has no boss there is no one to provide motivation for them, so they must provide themselves. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.120">Liaising with suppliers and buyers, and also possibly financial institutions would be the responsibility of the manager, using the information gathered while liaising with these people should help the person in this role to manage the business more effectively. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.120">
<s n="s1.5;p22.120">The decisional roles the person in this role will have to make are very important as they will affect the success of the business and there is no one to over see the decisions or to liaise with on important issues, so the manager must be entrepreneurial to be able to spot and exploit opportunities in the market, or to see future threats and change the business so that it isn't caught out when the threat appears. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p22.120">They must also be able to deal with any problems and resolve them, whether this be staffing issues or unexpected supply or sale issues. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p22.120">The ability to allocate resources is also essential, the resources available have to allocated in a way that will maximize there returns. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p22.120">This is where a good business mind is needed and also the use of the informational roles will help to make these decisions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.120">In this job the ability to negotiate will also be an important part of this job, if the person in this role can effectively negotiate then better prices may be obtained for inputs and outputs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.120">
<s n="s1.1;p23.120">Problems could also be resolved faster if the person is able to negotiate with the people involved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.120">
<s n="s1.2;p24.120">All these roles can be linked to the management tasks of production, marketing, financial and personal management. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.120">The following list shows which roles and tasks are linked: </s>
</p>
<list type="simple">

<s n="s2.6;p25.120">As the manager I would be responsible for day to day running of the farm and implementing plans, as the owner I would have to review the business to check that the management that is taken place is effective. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p25.120">As the manager of this business I would need good conceptual skills to process information, plan and make decisions, I would also need good human skills to lead and motivate the workforce and to co-ordinate their work. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p25.120">The technical skills are also very important for this role as help may be required from me, but also so I know what I am asking my workforce to do and know if it is achievable. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p25.120">I would also have to represent the business and monitor the business in the internal and external environment. </s>

<p n="p26.120">
<s n="s1.3;p26.120">This business will be largely affected by the external environment, as it will determine what is farmed and how it is farmed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.120">The external factors that influence the business fall into four main sectors; these are the political sector, the economic sector, the socio-cultural sector, and the technological sector. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.120">Within each sector there are many different factors that will affect the business is various ways, some of the main factors are set out below. </s>

<div3>
<head> Regulations: </head>
<p n="p27.120">
<s n="s1.2;p27.120">A farming business can be affected by regulations from four main areas; these are local regulations, national regulations, EU regulations and international regulations. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.120">These regulations will govern what can be grown and how it can be grown, these regulations are often very strict so have to be adhered to otherwise it could have severe consequences for the farmer and the business. </s>

<div3>
<head>Quotas: </head>
<p n="p28.120">
<s n="s1.3;p28.120">A quota will determine how much of a product a farmer can produce, if he produces over this quota he cannot guarantee that his product will be bought. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.120">This will dictate how the land is farmed and what production occurs. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.120">For example it is inefficient for the business to produce over its milk quota as we will be paying for the production but may not get a return on the product. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>Pressure groups : </head>
<p n="p29.120">
<s n="s1.2;p29.120">The pressure groups will affect what demand there is for certain products, for example if a large scale campaign was launched by a vegetarian group trying to promote vegetarianism then the demand for meat may fall affecting farmers prices and may meaning they have to change what is produced. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.120">Also the status of the business in the local and national community can be affected by pressure groups, if a farm is exposed as miss treating animals or using chemicals on crops that could endanger human health consumers are highly unlikely to buy from this source. </s>

<head>Trade barriers: </head>
<p n="p30.120">
<s n="s1.2;p30.120">If trade barriers are established by either UK or International governments then it may affect the import of UK produce to other countries and therefore lower the demand for the product, and this will also lead to a decline in the price of the product. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.120">An example of this is the EU ban on UK beef exports which was established after the BSE crisis in the UK. This saw the UK beef exports fall from £1bn before the ban to £20m in 2004 during the time of the ban. </s>

<head>Purchasing power: </head>
<p n="p32.120">

<head>Exchange rates: </head>
<p n="p33.120">

<s n="s1.2;p36.120">Farmers markets and farm shops have become more popular as people become more aware of the impacts of buying food that has travelled hundreds of miles and are starting to buy more local products. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p36.120">There is also an increase in novelty shopping occurring, this means that more people want something different from their shopping experience and so visiting the farm shop or farmers market makes the shopping experience different and more enjoyable. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p104.120">Budgetary control and financial control are both used as management controls, the definition of budgetary control is "the process of setting targets for an organisations expenditures, monitoring results and comparing them to the budget, and making changes as needed" (Daft, 2002). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p104.120">This means that the budget is used as a report to monitor planned and actual expenditures, they are used to look at costs, assets, investments and salaries, the budget will often set out expected costs and then actual costs so a comparison can easily be made between the two. </s>
</p>
<p n="p105.120">
<s n="s1.5;p105.120">Financial control is used to monitor the financial performance of an organisation using financial statements; they tell managers where the organisation stands financially and indicate possible future problems. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p105.120">The definition of a financial statement is "the basic information used for financial control of an organisation" (Daft, 2002). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p105.120">Financial analysis is linked to financial control; once finical statements have been prepared they need to be interpreted. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p105.120">This can mean comparing the organisations performance with previous years or with competitors or industry leaders. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p105.120">By creating these comparisons it allows the organisation to see if it is improving and how competitive it is. </s>
</p>
<p n="p106.120">
<s n="s1.10;p106.120">When carrying out budgeting analysis there are four different budgets that can be used, these are expense budgets, revenue budgets, cash budgets and capital budgets. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p106.120">The expense budget is used to look at anticipated and actual expenses, for each department and for the organisation as a whole. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p106.120">It can show all types of expenses or just focus on particular expenses such as research. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p106.120">The revenue budget lists the revenue that was forecasted and then the actual revenue received. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p106.120">If the revenues comes in below the expected amount then it means investigation is needed, investigation may also be needed if it is higher than expected. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p106.120">Cash budgets "estimates the receipts and expenditures on a daily or weekly basis to ensure that an organisation has sufficient cash to meet its obligations" (Daft, 2002). </s>
<s n="s7.10;p106.120">If the budget show the organisation has an excess then it may be able to invest to earn interest, if it is going to be low then arrangements have to be made to borrow money. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p106.120">Capital budget records investment plans that will be long lasting, often over a year, for assets such as plant and buildings. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p106.120">They will have great effect on future budgets, but will hopefully they will cause a rise in profits, if not then the investments are probably not worth while. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p106.120">The reason the cash budget is necessary is "to plan the impact of these expenditures on cash flow and profitability" (Daft, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p107.120">
<s n="s1.7;p107.120">There are three measures that can be used to carry out financial analysis these are the balance sheet, this shows the organisations financial situation at a specific point in time. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p107.120">It is concerned with the assets the organisation has and the liabilities it has. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p107.120">It gives three pieces of information, assets, liabilities and owner's equity. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p107.120">The second financial measure is the profit and loss account; this shows the wealth created by a business in a given period of time. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p107.120">On the profit and loss account there is information on revenues and expenses, which includes tax and depreciation. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p107.120">At the bottom there is the net income, this is the profit or loss for the given time. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p107.120">The third measure is the cash flow statement; this has details of receipts and payments, its shows when money will be coming into the organisation and when it will be going out. </s>
</p>
<p n="p108.120">
<s n="s1.2;p108.120">Other techniques that can be used to measure and control the organisational performance are the TQM (total quality management) techniques. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p108.120">Some of the techniques are listed below: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p109.120">
<s n="s1.5;p109.120">Quality circles - this is a group of between 6 and 12 volunteers who meet to help solve problems that affect the quality of their work. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p109.120">It is an ongoing process and meetings are usually held once a week. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p109.120">The members of the group may use existing data or they may collect their own. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p109.120">The idea of a quality circle is that the people who are doing the job can have an input to how it can be improved. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p109.120">This technique would not really work on the farm due to the low number of employees; the manager could operate an open communication system where employees feel confident to express their ideas on task and how to improve them. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p110.120">
<s n="s1.3;p110.120">Benchmarking - the definition of benchmarking is "the continuous process of measuring products, services, and practices against major competitors or industry leaders" (Daft, 2002). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p110.120">It is important that the company is honest with its self when it analysis itself, and that it picks a company with a similar goal and mission statement. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p110.120">The farm would be able to use this type of analysis, as it could compare itself to successful local or national farms. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p111.120">
<s n="s1.3;p111.120">Continuous improvement - this is the approach of changing a little bit constantly rather large scale changes infrequently. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p111.120">This type of change has the highest probability of success as it is a never ending system so the company can adjust to markets and demand in small stages. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p111.120">This method of control can be used on the farm as each worker can improve how they do their job and run their enterprise over time, this will mean that the farm will not have large costs at once, and it should also keep them at the front of their industry. </s>
</p>
<p n="p112.120">
<s n="s1.4;p112.120">Quality standards are also a way of measuring the performance of the business, an international example is the quality assurance scheme called ISO 9000. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p112.120">This is a set of standards that are created by the International Organisation for Standardisation, it is a globally recognised certificate that many businesses require and organisation to have before they will enter into business with them. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p112.120">An agricultural example of quality standard schemes are the Quality Assurance Schemes that operate for all sectors of the industry such as the Assured British Meat, who's aim is "To maintain and develop credible Standards within the red meat industry covering food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection and to promote integrated beef and lamb assurance to provide consumers and retailers with confidence about product safety" (ABM, date unknown). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p112.120">By complying with these standards the farm can be sure it is producing the highest quality meat as only the best will be allowed to enter the scheme. </s>
</p>
<p n="p113.120">
<s n="s1.5;p113.120">Another form of assessing a business performance is to take into account finances, markets, customers and employees so that the whole of the business can be evaluated rather than just the financial sector. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p113.120">An example of this method is the balance scorecard which is shown in diagram two. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p113.120">The balance scorecard looks at four key areas, financial performance, customer service, internal business processes, and the capacity to learn and grow. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p113.120">The farm can use this to view how its activities affect financial performance, how the farm is viewed by customers and its potential to gain more employees, how the farm operates and if it is meeting orders and costs, and the potential the farm has to improve and grow, this is mainly focussed towards employee development for the future. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p113.120">The son is an example of the development of an employee, by sending him to university he will gain a better understanding of modern agriculture and can then input his knowledge to the farm, and then one day take over being competent for the job due to previous investment from the farm in his education. </s>

</p>
<p n="p115.120">
<s n="s1.4;p115.120">A business needs to carry out analysis to establish where it stands compared to its competitors; it is done using a budget and financial analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p115.120">The budget analysis is used to set out expected expenditures and then to review what actually happens, it is done using four budgets these are expense, revenue, cash and capital budgets. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p115.120">Financial analysis looks at the businesses financial performance; this is done using three methods, the balance sheet, the profit and loss account and the cash flow statement. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p115.120">Other ways a business can analysis it self is by organisational analysis using TQM techniques such as benchmarking, and by using industry and quality standards. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p116.120">
<s n="s1.9;p116.120">In section one I set out to look at the roles the manager of this farm must perform and the technical, conceptual, and human skills that they must have. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p116.120">I have shown that the manager must be able to fill all the roles of management as he is the only one in a management position in the business. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p116.120">The owner and manager of this business is the same person so they must manage the farm on a daily basis and also review their management looking at it the eyes of the owner and implement changes that are necessary. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p116.120">The manager also needs good technical, conceptual, and human skills in order to process information, make decisions, and plan how they will be implemented. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p116.120">Also to lead, motivate, co-ordinate the workforce and to have knowledge of the work being carried out so assistance can be offered and proper planning can be achieved. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p116.120">In this section I also looked at the informational, interpersonal and decisional roles that apply to the manager and how these link to the management tasks of production, marketing, financial and personal management. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p116.120">To be able to find, understand, and use information is an important skill for the management, it relates to the financial side because it is important they are able to interpret financial accounts and important for production to ensure the farm is up to date with the latest techniques and is aware of the machines available to it. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p116.120">To have good interpersonal skills is essential as the manager will have to deal with employees as well as the external environment, he will have to be able to motivate the staff, while also be a spokesperson for the farm and liaise with customers and suppliers. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p116.120">As this is a small farm business having an entrepreneurial manager is a distinctive advantage as it means they will be able to exploit opportunities in the market and increase profits, this is part of the decisional roles that the manger must perform, which as I have shown in this section are a vital part of the skills the manger in this position must have. </s>
</p>
<p n="p117.120">
<s n="s1.3;p117.120">Section two looked at the main aspects of the external environment using the PEST framework, from this I was able to show that the farm will be influenced by every sector of the PEST framework, some of which have more detrimental affects than others, but all can ever be over come or worked around so that the business can continue to make a profit. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p117.120">This section also contained the main stakeholders, the main ones to the farm are the owner, the employees, the suppliers, and the customers they all have a very high interest in the business although it is only the owner who has high amounts of power. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p117.120">The farm is also important to the local and national economy as it provides jobs and brings money to the country and also to the local community. </s>
</p>
<p n="p118.120">
<s n="s1.4;p118.120">The SWOT analysis was used in section three; this used the PEST framework from the previous section as well as Porters 5 forces to create an image of the business internal and external environment. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p118.120">This section should that the business does have several threats mainly in the form of larger and local farms and from imports, but I have shown how these can be overcome but entering into niche markets such as organic, or to start new enterprises such as farm shops. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p118.120">I decided on a goal for the farm over the next two years, which was to become an organic farm. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p118.120">I have then used the SMART system to show that this is achievable; I then showed how the farm will change to an organic farm over a period of time which is mainly determined by the Soil Association. </s>
</p>
<p n="p119.120">
<s n="s1.4;p119.120">In section four communication within the business was examined, why it was important, the types used and problems that could occur. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p119.120">I showed how important communication is and how it is more than just talking; I showed how it is a vital part of the farm business but is often a difficult thing to get right. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p119.120">I showed the ways that could be used to communicate and explained why the face to face method would be the best to use on the farm. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p119.120">I showed the importance of using the correct delivery method when communicating and how it can cause problems if the incorrect method is used, I also listed the other barriers that occur and why. </s>
</p>
<p n="p120.120">
<s n="s1.3;p120.120">Section five was concerned with budgeting and financial analysis; I demonstrated how they are both important to a business so that it is able to analysis its financial state. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p120.120">I showed the types of analysis that could be used and what each one showed, and how it was useful to the business. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p120.120">I then looked at the organisational analysis that could be used to compare the business to industry leaders and competition, and how other areas of the business can be monitored other than just finance. </s>
