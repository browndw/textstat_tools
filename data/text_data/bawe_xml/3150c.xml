<p n="p1.5">
<s n="s1.5;p1.5">I have the impression that language games and activities are quite embarrassig the very first time in a new module, when you do not know the other people of the class. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.5">Also, I think in this moment it does not matter if they are in your mother tongue or in a foreign language - you just feel unsure about the whole situation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.5">However, their great benefit is that they usually ease the tense atmosphere in the class, because you have an opportunity to get to know your classmates a little bit better (e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.5">Things in Common, Memory name game, Find someone who...). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.5">Then, after the first two or three games, I think these activities can even be funny and enjoyable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.5">
<s n="s1.5;p2.5">Although some people might think that language games are a waste of time, because most of the time they have nothing in common with the actual topic of the lesson, I think that they can be of great value to the students. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.5">Even though these activities are called games, they are designed to provoke communication between students. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.5">As Harmer (2001) puts it, the games depend on an information gap so that one student has to talk to a partner in order to solve the task. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.5">Therefore, as long as the students play them seriously and just speak in their foreign language, these games provide an excellent, authentic opportunity for them to practice their communication skills. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.5">They are a useful way of giving students of every level valuable practise, because they often involve oral strategies such as describing, predicting, simplifying or asking for feedback (McDonough and Shaw 1993). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.5">
<s n="s1.9;p3.5">In my home country (Germany) we often played language games at school or at university, especially in the modules for the future foreign language teachers. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.5">However, it was always dependent on the class whether I liked these games or not. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.5">When I felt comfortable in the class then I quite liked playing language games and I also enjoyed trying out new ones. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.5">Especially as a young school girl I loved to play a game, which name I do not know, but which is very easy to play. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.5">You and your neighbour were a pair and the teacher asked both of you a simple question (e.g. what is the English word for "Hund"? </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.5">Answer: "Dog"). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.5">The one who answered it first won, the other one had to sit down. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.5">This went one till at the end there was just one person left, who was the winner and was then called "King". </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.5">I will definitely include this game as a language teacher, because we all really adored it, even when we were a little bit older. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.5">
<s n="s1.3;p4.5">In this module, I liked the "whistle dictation" quite much. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.5">I think this could be an easy way to let the students think about short definitions of words they are new to them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.5">It is also a nice possibility for the teacher to check whether they know the correct meaning of the lexis or not. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.5">
<s n="s1.3;p5.5">As I mentioned already in my first Portfolio, in Germany you have to decide before you begin your studies if you want to become a teacher afterwards or if you want to get a bachelor or master's degree. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.5">Therefore, it is automatically more a long-term career, because many of the modules at university relate to our later future as teachers and we also have to do a lot of practical training at school before our final exams. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.5">To conclude, I have not changed my view about the long-term career of language teaching at all and this module confirmed me that I really want to become a foreign language teacher! </s>
