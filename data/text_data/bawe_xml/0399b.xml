In fact, whether the Phillips curve slopes upwards, downwards, lies vertically or in fact exists at all is an issue which still remains open to debate and hence clearly carries significant implications for it's success as an economic management tool: "The Phillips Curve does not explain the eight years of economic expansion during the 1990's, when the U.S. economy experienced historically low unemployment and low price inflation, simultaneously! </s>
<s n="s7.9;p24.24">Is this another contradiction of the Phillips Curve, or does it suggest that the Phillips Curve has shifted yet again, this time to the left, and now comprised of lower inflation and unemployment combinations?" (<seg type="URL" n="http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/index.cfm?lesson=EM219"/>). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p24.24">The ambiguity which shrouds the issue of the Phillips relation is a clear reflection of the growing volatility and growing frequency with which the nature of the economy is changing. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p24.24">External factors, such as price shocks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, are exerting increasing influence over the function and overall stability of both the national and international economy, rendering the derivation and applicability of such a relationship as the Phillips Curve, an extremely problematical or perhaps even impossible task. </s>
