<s n="s1.8;p1.33">The supply-side macroeconomic debate between Keynesians and monetarists has continued throughout our post-modern time. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.33">The extreme Keynesian views about the shape of aggregate supply (AS) curve have been challenged as a result of the emergence of monetarist and moderate Keynesian thought.<ref target="BAWE_0094e-ftnote.001"/> Most economists disagree with the extreme Keynesian view that the shape of AS curve is horizontal in the short run and vertical in the long run. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.33">This is a problem, because it would be beneficial for a government to know how the nature of AS affects the success of a chosen fiscal or monetary policy. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.33">Surprisingly, there is no absolute certainty about the shape of the short run AS curves. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.33">Moderate thinkers have tried to adjust the extreme Keynesian model of AS curve into a more empirically accurate form whereas the monetarists have challenged the fundamentals of Keynesian model. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.33">In this essay, the starting point for discussion is the extreme Keynesian view: vertical long-run aggregate supply curve (LRAS) combined with a horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS), which can be combined into an L-shaped curve.<ref target="BAWE_0094e-ftnote.002"/> The underlying theory of such AS curves is explained below, followed by discussion of alternative views. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.33">In sum, I aim to challenge the extreme Keynesian AS model. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.33">Like all models, it is a rough representation of reality and due to its rigidity it is highly disputable. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p31.33">This model was created based upon the developments of 1950s and 1960s - empirical evidence from that time period supports the moderate Keynesian model and it was almost unchallenged until the emergence of the 1970s crisis and monetarist thought. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p33.33">It seems inevitable that the academic debate about the shape of AS curves will continue further, because of the monetarist/Keynesian division. </s>

<s n="s4.8;p33.33">It is interesting to observe how after several years of research the economic schools of thought disagree on some fundamental aspects of the AS analysis. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p33.33">Governments find themselves in a difficult position, because the models predict e.g. wage behaviour in different ways. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p33.33">Nevertheless, the extreme Keynesian view has lost many supporters and the academic consensus to the moderate view. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p33.33">I believe it is not a great exaggeration to say that the L-shaped model of the SRAS/LRAS curve is too rigid for the present day economic thought. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p33.33">However, it is clear that monetarists and Keynesians disagree, and the debate will continue for the foreseeable future. </s>
