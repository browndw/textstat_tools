<s n="s1.10;p2.12">Barker states that one of her intentions whilst writing <hi rend="italic">Union Street</hi> was to give a voice to the working class women whose stories has not been heard, and had been dismissed as unimportant and irrelevant. </s>

<s n="s6.11;p4.12">Alice Bell fights the welfare workers to the end, refusing to go into a care home and dies, sadly not in her own home, but at least on her own terms 'she wanted to die in her own home. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p5.12">Pregnant and unmarried, with a boyfriend who reacts to the news by having violent sex with her 'she was afraid for the baby... he was trying to screw it out of her' (100) Joanne is trapped with no real alternative offered to her. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p5.12">Similarly Blonde Dinah's chapter is in fact more about her elderly client George Harrison than it is about her. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.12">She is defined by her job as a prostitute and although George does attempt to depict her in a more humanistic and positive light 'He listened to her talk... the cracked and seamed face lit up... as she talked about the past, about the people she had known' (226) we only hear her speak as reported by George. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.12">She is the only woman in the book who does not have a voice of her own, it has been appropriated by her clients. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.12">This is hardly makes for exhilarating reading. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.15;p6.12">There is an argument for a sense of exhilaration through the down to earth, realistic style of Barker's writing. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p6.12">The author herself claims that the characters are based on women she knew when she was growing up, and the blunt northern dialogue is certainly naturalistic 'You mucky bloody sod' (2) 'He could see she was a bairn' (37). </s>
<s n="s3.15;p6.12">The disclaimer at the start of the novel is clearly ironic, preparing the reader for a realist text. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p6.12">However this is not a naturalistic or realist novel in the classical sense. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p6.12">The narrative is highly symbolic, each woman representing a different aspect of the life cycle of one woman. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p6.12">Coming to terms with sexuality, for Kelly this comes violently and far too early, pregnancy, post natal depression, marriage, motherhood, loss of loved ones, abortion and death. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p6.12">The women get older with each chapter, and finally, under a tree which is clearly representative of life itself 'withered and unwithering' (265) the oldest and youngest characters meet and both face their mortalities 'at the same moment...she found it possible to believe in her own death' (67) 'it was time for them both to go' (265). </s>
<s n="s8.15;p6.12">The symbolism is obvious and therefore not necessarily very effective, however it does make the message of the text more universal and humanistic, where it could have been very dry and politicised. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p6.12">D.J. Taylor argues that 'realism is at least a limited or partial aesthetic'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.009"/> and quotes Eva Figes as saying 'the English social realist tradition cannot contain the realities of my lifetime, horrors which one might have called surreal if they had not actually happened'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p6.12">Obviously in Union Street a degree of realism is key, and the blunt, matter-of-fact descriptions of some horrific scenes for example 'unbidden came the memory of the other child, red as raw meat, gasping its life out on the lavatory floor' (220) is surely meant to shock us and indeed make us stand back and consider 'what these poor women have to put up with'. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p6.12">There is an argument for a kind of exhilaration here, the kind one would attach to violent films, perhaps, or to the sense of disbelief that comes with the realisation that these scenes were a reality for many women. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p6.12">Indeed the psychological and emotional depiction of the characters is highly realistic, Haywood even describes it as 'pioneering'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p6.12">However there are some things that traditional realism cannot achieve. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p6.12">The lack of an observational narrator allows the reader to become more highly involved and attached to the characters, creating a much greater emotional impact. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p6.12">Kirk argues that 'the narrative[s] are seen to refuse the pitfalls of monologism, a characteristic predicated of "classic" realism'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.012"/> There is also a sentimentality in the symbolic nature of the narrative which has just as much impact, and is perhaps, 'exhilarating' in a different, more positive way. </s>

<s n="s2.14;p7.12">The only pointer we have in the text itself to suggest any kind of time frame is the various mentioning of the Northern Ireland troubles as read by the women in newspapers, and fleeting references to miners' strikes. </s>

<s n="s6.14;p7.12">Government has nowt to do with it' (241), the novel often skims over contemporary events, mentioning them briefly but never dwelling on them as something which particularly affects the lives of these women. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p7.12">Haywood points out 'these absences could be the whole point'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.013"/>, but also finds a problem with it. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p7.12">'If the overall point is that history as conventionally defined has passed these women by, the essential critical question is the extent to which the novel colludes with that disempowerment." </s>

<s n="s10.14;p7.12">Of course the national does creep in, but only via issues which affect the women's lives directly i.e. deindustrialization causes their husbands to lose their jobs, miners' strikes cause a shortage of coal. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p7.12">This poses a problem for Michele Hanson's comment, as this form of disempowerment would undercut the idea that the women are in fact empowered in any way by their stoicism in such hard times. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p7.12">The only solution seems to me to take the view that rejecting conventional history in the novel is necessary to allow the women's stories to be told. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p7.12">The novel does suggest that the women are uninterested in history as it stands, but equally, conventional history has never been interested in them. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p8.12">Not only this, but he suggests that Alice and Kelly's encounter, which both begins and ends the novel, develops a 'sense of mutuality...which calls for a recognition of communality and kind,' 'a kind of sisterhood which transcends age and is grounded in identifications of gender, class and community." </s>

<s n="s1.16;p10.12">If we choose to read the women's shared bravery and courage as an 'exhilarating' sense of community, overcoming their shared hardships together, then in a way we choose to read it as a feminist text. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p10.12">The fact that it was picked up by Virago, a publisher of books by and about women also backs this up. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p10.12">However this creates the possibility that for a male reader, <hi rend="italic">Union Street</hi> would be particularly un-exhilarating. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p10.12">Any male characters that they could possibly relate to are 'written off'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.020"/> according to Seabrook, and for Haywood, 'the only sympathetic men...are sexually unthreatening...inert... or are ready to undergo a feminist conversion." </s>

<s n="s5.16;p10.12">Quotes from Barker herself on the matter range from 'I never thought for a second that feminism is only about women'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.022"/> to 'they aren't allowed to say much. </s>

<s n="s12.16;p10.12">Admittedly, what Barker depicts is symptomatic of the realities of deindustrialization and the difficulties facing both men and women in adjusting to these economic changes, having to re-evaluate their roles in the family unit, and finding that this can pull them further and further apart. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p10.12">However, there is often a sense that men are simply a burden to women. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p10.12">Although Muriel Scaife is shown to have enjoyed a long and loving marriage to her husband, and Joss proves to be a strong and reliable friend to both Iris and Joanne, it is noticeable that both these men are in some way feminised, both displaying a castrating 'lack'. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p10.12">George Harrison's late sexual awakening may be a positive for him, but it is at the expense of Blonde Dinah, for whom prostitution and therefore sex is 'just a job' (227). </s>

<s n="s1.9;p11.12">Haywood also points out that 'women inhabit an elemental world of feminine experience'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.027"/> citing frequent references to periods and other bodily fluids. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p11.12">This could be considered as a way of representing women as being more connected to nature and the fundamental essence of life, as well as a continuation of the symbolic theme of the female life cycle. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p11.12">These are things which connect all women, arguably reinforcing the idea of a community grounded in 'sisterhood'. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p11.12">However Haywood suggests that 'such an approach reinforces biological reductionism' and that the women's 'inability...to control their own bodies and social backwardness of the setting... positions the narrative uncomfortably on the edge of a form of cultural voyeurism'<ref target="BAWE_0224g-ftnote.028"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p11.12">A reinforcement of this representation as a positive aspect comes surprisingly from a male character. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p11.12">George Harrison contemplates 'He had always believed there were two sorts of women: the decent ones and the rest...how could you remember they were different, if every sag, every wrinkle of their used bodies proclaimed that they were one flesh?'(230) </s>
<s n="s7.9;p11.12">This is clearly an uncomfortable description of the female form, but it unites women in their bodily experiences. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p11.12">George's encounter with Blonde Dinah is highly voyeuristic, but leads him to a greater understanding of women than he had before, perhaps even greater than any of the other men in the novel. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p11.12">There is always a danger of 'biological reductionism' in such an approach, but Barker's matter of fact take on it neatly avoids this, turning it into a positive aspect of the novel. </s>
