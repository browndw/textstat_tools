<s n="s5.8;p1.35">The expected for the deflection was 0.068 mm since this value had a standard deviation of 0.012 mm the mean value of 0.079 is accurate. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.35">The average value of the coefficient of friction between the brass pin and moving steel surface turned out to be 0.3095. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.35">The expected value was 0.267 this had an uncertainty of 0.046. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p2.35">The expected result for the deflection which was 0.068 mm differed from the obtained mean value of 0.079 mainly due to the difficulties that arise when trying to read the deflection of the dial gauge. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.35">Which kept on moving in to either side so rapidly, at an uncertainty of about (+) or (-) 1. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.35">This would have resulted in the change in the final value obtained for the coefficient of friction. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.35">Also a number of errors occurred during the experiment would have resulted in the change in the final reading. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.35">This would have been due to the work hardening of the pin and also due to the friction in the pivots and the wasted parts of the machine. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.35">The zero error of the gauge would also result in the difference in the final reading. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p3.35">
<s n="s1.10;p3.35">The value obtained had a mean of be 0.3095, which is between 0 and 1 and close to 0.3 as mentioned. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.35">The gathered results from all of the participating students also seem to be of similar values with the average value working out at 0.275 with an uncertainty of 0.046. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.35">Thus the value I obtained seems sensible and realistic. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.35">The dial gauge needed to be calibrated after switching on, before placing the load to make sure there was no zero error. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.35">The machine was vibrating so vigorously it was very hard to obtain a reading. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.35">This would have effected in the spread of results. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.35">To minimize this error the experiment was repeated a couple of times. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.35">Also the brass pin wearing also would have affected in people in different groups getting different values, but comparatively I think this error is negligible. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.35">However looking at the set of results obtained we can state that the value of coefficient of friction is close to the theoretical value between the two surfaces. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.35">Therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the value obtained for the coefficient of friction between the brass pin and the moving steel is very accurate. </s>
