<s n="s1.7;p1.25">Breaking formally with Spain in 1821, postcolonial Peru would witness significant changes in the state's approach to its indigenous majority and the "Indian problem".<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.002"/> Peru emerged after independence as thoroughly divided, comprising an ethnically heterogeneous peasant mass scattered throughout a diverse landscape, and a small pool of largely city-residing elites determined to secure national progress. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.25">Influenced by the core ideals of <hi rend="italic">La Ilustración</hi> and a Bolivarian desire to extirpate colonialism's despotic legacy, the <hi rend="italic">limeño</hi> ruling class pursued a republican project of integration to secure its position at the apex of national authority.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.003"/> In line with this enterprising trajectory, the tribute and provincial <hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> systems were abolished in the immediate post-independence years, furthering the colonial assault on the indigenous nobility begun in the wake of the Túpac Amaru rebellion of 1780.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.004"/> In irrigating the coastal economy, a thirty-year guano export boom would however effectively undermine state-sierra relations and Creole attention to the hinterlands, facilitating the rise of a regional <hi rend="italic">caudillismo</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.25">Despite the liberal republican discourse fuelling a modernising drive, Indians were routinely contained along established lines of "paternalistic exploitation"<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.005"/>, the contradictions of which would come to enhance their political consciousness and inspire salient instances of revolt. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.25">While elite interests lobbied for power, the desire to erode communal landholdings and penetrate the Andean interior would inflame civil tensions. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.25">Coinciding with the consolidation of liberal control in the 1870s, local rebellions became increasingly more frequent, their characteristics and intensity reflecting the interplay of regionally-specific geographic and socio-economic conditions. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.25">Broadly speaking, the War of the Pacific (1879-84) would precipitate greater peasant organisation, and nourish disenchantment with a national project that undermined basic rights.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.006"/> With the government aspiring to heightened implementation of individual taxation via the <hi rend="italic">contribución personal</hi>, a renewed integrationist drive further antagonised regional disdain, underpinning a sharpened indigenous reaction to state designs on community life. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.25">Though these developments implied a marked growth in Indians' conception of the nation, prevailing Creole interpretation came to belittle such protest, returning to lament the problem of a backward, unassimilated peasant majority.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.007"/> Both as communities and individuals, Indians could by the century's closure more readily envisage the construction of a nation, though this did not universally transpire as a desire to belong. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p2.25">Though Peru had declared its separation from the peninsula in 1821 - one of the last of the South American colonies to do so - the Royalist cause would not be entirely undone until the defeat of the remaining Spanish forces some three years later at Ayacucho.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.008"/> While the 'foreign' armies of Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín directed much of the republican cause, Indian participation in defence of an emergent <hi rend="italic">patria</hi> was of central importance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.25">Far from imbuing the nation's leadership with confidence however, this mobilisation incited Creole fears of latent peasant uprising. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.25">Although Indian involvement in independence aroused hopes widespread faith in the nation-state, <hi rend="italic">limeño</hi> elites regarded an integrationist drive as imperative to cement their authority, particularly in areas of the central sierra where communities had fought loyally for the Royalist cause.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.009"/> Adding substance to the prevailing enlightenment and modernising ideals, the decrees of San Martín in 1821 and Bolívar in 1825 outlawing personal service enshrined a liberal trajectory and provided the impetus for penetration of the Andes. <ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.25">While acquiring a republican gloss, the assault on provincial power was nevertheless in many respects a continuation of colonial attempts to erode the authority of the <hi rend="italic">caciques</hi>; a policy undertaken in earnest following the tumultuous 'Great Rebellion' of 1780 led by Túpac Amaru II.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.011"/> Though Creole rhetoric would actively deny the political capacity of the peasantry, such insurrection hinted at a developing indigenous consciousness, rooted in acute aversion to intervention in local authority. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.25">In general, Creole distaste for the Indian was manifold, rejecting the preference for ostensibly inferior indigenous tongues such as Quechua over Spanish, superstitious syncretic Catholic practises, and an apparently innate aversion to private property and enterprise. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.25">Despite the optimistic proclamations of revolutionary leaders, the geographical and ideological gulf between the capital and hinterlands remained great,<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.012"/> and the government would face much peasant opposition to efforts at enhanced assimilation. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.25">In an era in which Enlightenment principles of liberty, equality, and citizenship featured strongly, the divisions created by ethno-cultural, economic, and class differences proved problematic to a state model seeking to increase its sovereignty. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.25">Geographically, the nation comprised three distinct areas: a "desert-like" pacific coast, the mountainous Andean range, and a set of low tropical valleys in the eastern Amazon basin.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.013"/> Such dissimilarity served to highlight the physical and psychological distance between regions, and resultant lack of a common identity and history for their inhabitants. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.25">Ethnic heterogeneity further eroded a sense of universality; both in terms of internal distinctions between indigenous groups and divisions along caste lines of white, <hi rend="italic">mestizo</hi>, Indian, black, and Chinese.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.014"/> According to an 1812 estimate, Peru constituted some 1,509,511 inhabitants, of whom 178,025 were Spanish, 954,799 Indian, 287,486 <hi rend="italic">mestizo</hi>, and 89,241 black slaves. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.25">With the indigenous bulk of this population scattered across the vast central highlands, Indian communities remained fragmented sites of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity stretching back beyond pre-conquest times. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.25">While they acknowledged, and would often rebel against, an overbearing national authority, individual Indian communities did not at this stage project a sense of solidarity with one another, much less an idea of the nation as a whole. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p5.25">In cementing control of the government, church, army, education, and commerce, conservative interests would essentially dominate. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.25">In any case, a degree of merging of conservative and liberal thought transpired in the late 1820s, reflecting fears of the insurrectionary potential of the interior and a consequent preoccupation with securing law and discipline.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.016"/> Divisions were nonetheless still pronounced over attitudes to the guerrilla bands occupying the capital's surrounding area, with breakaway portions of the liberal contingent seeking alliance with <hi rend="italic">bandolero</hi> leaders. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p8.25">Equally, the state saw fit to increase the numbers employed within the temporal <hi rend="italic">alcalde</hi> role, the aim being to ensure greater regulation and monitoring of taxation, and to provide a fertile climate for individualism, property ownership, and stability. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.25">In usurping the last vestiges of the Inca nobility, <hi rend="italic">alcaldes</hi> were expressly appointed for their loyalty and fiscal obligation, and enjoyed privileges such as tax exempt status for their support.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.023"/> In the 1830s, these officials were regarded as instrumental in furthering the drive to weaken regional political autonomy, especially within problematic areas such as the Cuzco department where memory of the erstwhile <hi rend="italic">Tawantisuyo</hi>, the Inca realm, remained strong even after centuries of Spanish colonial rule. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.25">As the historian Víctor Peralta Ruíz highlights, though the <hi rend="italic">varayoc</hi> tended to attain a greater quotidian presence than their <hi rend="italic">alcalde</hi> counterparts and preside for "un tiempo indefinido en su cargo", the two positions would increasingly be identified as one and the same as the century progressed.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.024"/> While it would not prove immediately enforceable, a later abolition of tribute in 1854 would provide renewed anti-<hi rend="italic">cacique</hi> legalisation, affirming the decline in <hi rend="italic">kuraka</hi> authority. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p21.25">In the valley's south around the Huancayo province, the prolonged destructive presence of the Chilean forces - and the collaborationist stance adopted by prominent local landowners like Jacinto Cevallos - inspired the projection of a class-based proto-nationalism on the part of the local peasantry.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.054"/> Possessing sufficient power to mobilise, the peasantry fought both the Chilean invader and higher-class interests alike, articulating a love for the homeland as the place in which one was born, drew subsistence, and prospered. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p21.25">Conversely, with a relatively lesser Chilean presence and greater entwining of interests, Mantaro's northern social groups did not to replicate the mutual hostility of their southern counterparts, instead proffering a multi-class defence of the land.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.055"/> This owed much to the relative local impotence of the <hi rend="italic">montoneras</hi>: the northern elite, feeling less threatened, could more readily assert their support for Cáceres. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p21.25">Reflecting the local elite's dominance, peasant nationalism was not be given the same opportunity to develop, with the lower class remaining more easily controlled. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p22.25">In the north-western Department of Cajamarca, a unique set of circumstances spawned an alternative national resistance, rooted in an alliance between the elite and peasantry in rebellion against the state. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p22.25">The ability to formulate and manipulate a multi-class, multi-ethnic resistance owed much to the lack of strong native roots in the region.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.056"/> For the village peasantry, the absence of a communal tradition was further compounded by the paucity of economic opportunities, reducing the bulk of the population to a virtual serfdom perpetuated by <hi rend="italic">hacendado</hi> control over the land. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p25.25">The bulk of the population would remain scattered across a diverse geographical landscape, but state alterations to tribute and taxation systems, the erosion of communal property rights, and participation in a war with a foreign power all contributed to heighten Indian acknowledgement of the nation state. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p25.25">The general trend towards a liberal republican direction would nonetheless prove at odds with the indigenous population's desire to maintain their traditional communities, and the gulf between the government's modernising rhetoric and conservative use of the <hi rend="italic">varayoc</hi> system inspired significant periods of instability. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p25.25">Chilean destruction of local communities advanced notions of a common cause and bridged regional divisions, but such notions did not automatically evolve into patriotism and regard for state power. </s>

<s n="s8.10;p25.25">In light of a wartime conscription demands, this action highlighted the peasantry's disdain for the government's renewed emphasis on taxation and oppression, and the direction the nation was taking. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p25.25">Though maintenance of an exploitative model had facilitated elite control of a peasant mass in preliminary years, it ultimately inhibited commitment to the country's liberal trajectory, leading intellectuals to once again examine the "Indian problem" retarding modern development. </s>
