<s n="s1.6;p59.60">PVSYST is a comprehensive PV project design package that has lots of potential. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p59.60">It has great graphical representations of sun path diagrams, data histograms, energy losses. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p59.60">It has the ability to design and view your systems orientation with nearby shading objects such as trees and buildings in 3-D. The data from these shading factors can then be seen to affect your PV systems power output. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p59.60">The software is by no means perfect and could be further improved by addition of more features and better navigation throughout pages. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p59.60">One annoyance is the fact you can only specify your array size in the 'Preliminary' and not the 'Project' sections of the software. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p59.60">This would be immensely helpful when choosing your module types, numbers of and hence size of area taken up by modules. </s>
</p>
<p n="p60.60">
<s n="s1.6;p60.60">RETscreen is based on Microsoft excel spreadsheets and is therefore a case of plug in your values and see how this affects the final values. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p60.60">The spreadsheet trends to over calculate your power output compared to PVSYST even though it assumes some losses. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p60.60">You are unable to enter the PV area required in m <hi rend="sup">2</hi>, only the nominal PV array power that then automatically predicts the array area in m <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p60.60">There is less choice in PV module manufacturers to choose from. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p60.60">You cannot choose a specific inverter, only the number of inverters but it does allow you to enter the inverter efficiency if you are lucky enough to know it. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p60.60">RETscreen feels and looks more like a 'system costs model' for business, rather than a piece of software designed specifically for PV design such as PVSYST. RETscreen lacks any graphical representations of data or design, and lacks the broader overall features of PVSYST. The only real advantage of RETscreen over PVSYST is that the software is free! </s>
