<s n="s1.12;p1.17">In the sixteenth and seventeen centuries witches were seen as a real threat and object of fear, not just by ordinary people, but also those of education; hence from the outset of this essay the current dismissal of witchcraft must be forgotten. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p1.17">From the first witchcraft statute in 1542 to the repeal of the last in 1736 there were fewer than 1,000 executions for this crime; a figure of half this is probably closer to the mark. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p1.17">Even at the height of prosecutions, from 1570 to 1680, there were only about 4 to 9 executions per year, from a population of 3.5 to 5 million in England. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p1.17">Hence, unlike the so called witch hunts of the continent, except in a few isolated cases, '...the term witch-craze remains a misnomer for England'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.001"/> 'Studies of witchcraft depositions in... </s>
<s n="s5.12;p1.17">England... reveal that many of those who were prosecuted for witchcraft were in fact women." </s>

<s n="s6.12;p1.17">As James Sharpe identifies this is 'one of the greatest problems facing the historian of witchcraft...', <ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.003"/> with Scarre illustrating that '...conclusions have been difficult to verify." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s7.12;p1.17">Before the 1970s little attention was paid to this issue, however the gender issues of the decade aroused more interest. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p1.17">Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English argued that the witchcraft phenomenon 'was a ruling class campaign of terror directed against the female peasant population..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s9.12;p1.17">However, recent historiography has strayed from this simplistic line of argument and developed many other reasons for the high numbers of women in witchcraft prosecutions. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p1.17">As Brian Levack argues women were more likely to be accused of witchcraft but there was nothing that excluded men. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p1.17">This point is interesting, as although there were many more female than male witches, men were still prosecuted and found guilty, which does not fit into Ehrenreich's and English's thesis. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p1.17">One of the most common arguments in recent years has been that '...witchcraft was sex-related but not a sex-specific crime'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.006"/> Understanding the witchcraft phenomenon as a 'persecution of women' must therefore come into question. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p2.17">The transcriptions give some background and evidence for the actual crime of the witch used in court, but were written by court officials, who were generally men, who could have lead the witness in the direction they wanted, and their survival rate is very rare, so it is difficult to make nationwide assumptions. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.17">The problem with many of these legal sources is that '...the status of the accused seems to have been mentioned only when it was slightly unusual'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.007"/> This leads to problems of gathering data, as those accused that were not married, widowed and so on would be far more highly represented than those who were in fairly normal conditions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.17">Gaskill argues that 'for the majority of English witchcraft cases, we have at best a few depositions or perhaps a pamphlet account, but more often only the basic court records survived which tell us little about what witchcraft actually meant to people'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.008"/> However, more recently there has been '...the adoption of anthropological and sociological methodologies, and a greater attention to archival sources, and an interest in focusing on history from below' which has enriched the study of witchcraft. <ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.17">The traditional view of women in sixteenth and seventeenth century England can go a long way to explaining '...why people found it more natural to associate witchcraft with the female than with the male sex..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s2.4;p3.17">In the bible women were described as "the weaker vessel"<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.011"/> and led to the more general 'Judaeo-Christian view of women as the source of sin and the fall of man'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.012"/> Aristotle also saw women as inferior and 'it was even questioned by some writers whether women were really human beings, or whether they belonged to some lesser species'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.013"/> Luther however, praised women as the 'most beautiful of God's creations', but likened her inferiority to that of the moon in respect to the sun.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.014"/> One of the most important and widely cited contemporary views of women can be found in <hi rend="italic">Malleus Maleficarum</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.17">This text depicts women as 'more credulous',<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.015"/> hence the devil aiming to corrupt faith was more likely to attack them. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.17">They are also described as being 'naturally more impressionable, and 'more ready to receive the influence of a disembodied spirit', which when combined with their 'slippery tongues', meant 'that since they are both feebler both in mind and in body, it is not surprising that they should come more under the spell of witchcraft'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.016"/> Especially pertinent for the actual crime of witchcraft was the notion that 'all witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which in women is insatiable'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.017"/> This was because 'it was believed that the witch often made a pact with the devil as a result of sexual temptation and then engaged with promiscuous sexual activity at the Sabbath'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.018"/> Hence, not only is there a clear message in the view of women in early modern England of moral weakness and inferiority from, for example, the Bible and Aristotle, but this is specifically related to the act of witchcraft by contemporaries, compounding existing stereotypes. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.17">Such views of women have been used by some historians to illustrate England as a patriarchal society that manipulated witchcraft accusations as a method of controlling women. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.17">Marianne Hester is one of the leading figures promoting such a thesis, arguing that '... the witch hunts were part of the ongoing mechanisms for social control within a general context of social change and the reconstruction of a patriarchal society'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.019"/> During this period in England the patriarchal ideal was that women should be quiet and subservient to their husbands. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.17">Hester argues that witchcraft must been seen in the wider social context of fears that 'women were by no means complying with the ideal of the compliant wife'<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.020"/>. </s>
