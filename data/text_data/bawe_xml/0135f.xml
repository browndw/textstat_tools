<s n="s4.6;p1.19">Clearly, the assumption on Segal's part that international relations is the arena of superpowers and rivalry led him to conclude that China was not a terribly important country. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.19">However, the aim of this essay is to expose the importance of China through a theoretical approach which places China within a larger capitalist world order. </s>

<s n="s10.10;p7.19">The opening of China's workforce to foreign companies and its resulting role in the current nature of capitalism, thus clearly plays an important role in the world today, from the cheap products available to consumers throughout the developed world, to the increase in competition among developing countries, particularly in Asia. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p9.19">Two factors can explain this decision: firstly, an awareness on the part of the Chinese government that China was "being out performed by its neighbours, most irksomely by Taiwan"<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.011"/>, which as described above, is a problem which has been redressed following the introduction of FDI. Secondly, there was a need to reinforce legitimacy in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) following the disastrous results of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution which forbad the use of international trade to promote economic growth. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s6.7;p9.19">Further evidence of China's dependence on the benefits of global capitalism can be exposed by observing China's performance in international institutions such as the UN Security Council and more significantly, the WTO, where it "has been acting for the most part as a system-maintainer, not a system-reformer or system-transforming revolutionary"<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.19">While some may argue this is simply indicative of an apathy towards or unwillingness to get involved with international affairs, it is also clearly linked to the fact that at present, China would have too much to lose through questioning the prevailing order. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p10.19">While the relationship between the accumulation of capital and the accumulation of power cannot be denied, Arrighi's emphasis on the pursuit of power and therefore the element of voluntarism in capital accumulation, is perhaps still connected to a realist analysis of power rivalry. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p14.19">What must be recognised is that countries such as Taiwan represent an intermediary stage of a process which originates in near monopoly-status companies. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.19">For example, the largest footwear factory in the world which is located in China, is a Taiwanese-run enterprise that produces running shoes for Addidas, Nike, Reebok and other major (American or European) brand names<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.022"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.19">To summarise, China does matter: in fact its role as the biggest and ever-growing production force in a chain of densely-networked companies and contractors, is indispensable to the current capitalist world order. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p16.19">Firstly, increasing unemployment, the causes of which can be directly associated to China's role in global capitalism, in particular the government's decision to join the WTO. The State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) of the 1950s and 1960s, while inefficient and to a large extent, redundant, did provide employment to millions of workers across China. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p16.19">However, as Lardy points out, if China continues to subsidise these SOEs, the efficiency gains of WTO membership will fall far short of what studies postulate<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.023"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p16.19">Privatisation or abolition of SOEs will mean and has meant significant increases in unemployment. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p16.19">The importation of machinery and equipment to aid production and efficiency, thereby further reducing costs has also resulted in further lay-offs. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p16.19">In 2002 it was estimated that employment in the automobile industry was expected to fall by 500,000 and in agriculture by 11 million<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.024"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p16.19">These figures may seem insignificant in a population of over one billion. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p16.19">However, what should be noted is, as An Chen describes, the state itself lacks adequate financial means to establish a nationwide system of social welfare benefits for the poorer sections"<ref target="BAWE_0135f-ftnote.025"/>, leaving the unemployed no means of subsistence. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p19.19">To conclude, Segal's conclusion that China is not a terribly important country has been contended not through a discussion of Segal's own terms of analysis, but through an analysis which stems from an alternative overall approach. </s>
