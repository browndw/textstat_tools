<s n="s1.8;p2.41">The C. elegans nematode has been used by development researchers for decades; over the past two, the focus has been upon genetic analysis to understand the pattern of cell fate in the embryo. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.41">The <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> organism is useful for study because of its cellular simplicity, easy maintenance of stocks, workable genetics and an accessible embryo. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.41">The early cells fates are determined by asymmetric divisions, localisation of regulatory molecules and cell to cell interactions. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.41">The cell to cell interactions come in two forms; first a cell or group of cells send a signal that alter the fate of an adjacent cell or, signals from one cell alter the polarisation of a second cell so it divides asymmetrically (Rose <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1998). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.41">These signals are usually produced from maternally loaded mRNA (maternal effect genes), that are positioned in the egg by the mother during the production of mature oocytes. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.41">The first axis to be produced is the anterior-posterior (AP) axis at the 1-cell stage, with the sperm-derived centrosome breaking the symmetry of the oocyte. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.41">Second, the dorso-ventral (DV) axis is formed at the transition between the 2 and 4-cell stage, with EMS defining the ventral side of the embryo. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.41">Third, the left-right (LR) axis is detectable at the transition between the 4 and 6-cell stage, by two granddaughters cells of AB (ABal and ABpl) (see figure 1) which define the left side of the embryo (Gönczy <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2005, Worm Book). </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.41">The largest insight into the mechanisms of forming A-P cell polarity in the zygote came form the study of six maternal-effect mutants that resulted in a defective A-P polarity at the 1-cell stage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.41">
<s n="s1.1;p5.41">Within the <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> zygote polarisation occurs in two phases, the establishment phase before the pronuclear meeting and the maintenance phase after (Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.41">
<s n="s1.2;p6.41">The initial polarisation is believed to emanate from the nucleation of sperm-derived microtubules around the sperm pronucleus (Wallenfang <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.41">The formation of this microtubule organising centre appears to correlate in space and time with the earliest signs of polarity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.41">
<s n="s1.2;p7.41">During the nuclear migration the pronuclear-centrosomal complex rotates by 90˚ to orientate the spindles along the A-P axis (Gotta <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2001) a pseudocleavage furrow is formed, which later regresses allowing cytoplasmic flow to occur (see figure 3). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.41">It is during this process that the maternally loaded PAR proteins become asymmetrically distributed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.41">
<s n="s1.3;p8.41">PAR-1, a ser/thr kinase and PAR-2, a ring finger protein are localised on the posterior side of the zygote near to the entry of the sperm asters (Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.41">In a paper by Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al,</hi> PAR-2 protein was coupled to GFP and its movement monitored shortly after fertilisation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.41">The findings showed that it is enriched in the posterior cortex centred around the centrosome and then progresses outward towards the anterior until 50% of the egg is covered (Gönczy and Rose 2005). </s>

<head>
<hi rend="bold">Figure 3. Establishment of the Anterior-Posterior Axis:</hi> The sperm pronuclear/centrosome complex(es) triggers cortical rearrangements and cytoplasmic flows to polarize the axis. During this phase, the cortical PAR proteins become asymmetrically distributed, the oocyte pronucleus (o) migrates to the posterior, and the germline P granules move to the posterior. Polarization culminates in posterior displacement of the spindle and an asymmetric first cleavage in which determinants are segregated to one or the other daughter. This cleavage results in a larger anterior daughter AB, and a smaller posterior daughter P <hi rend="sub">1</hi> .Diagram form Lyczak <hi rend="italic"> et al</hi> 2002</head>

<p n="p9.41">
<s n="s1.2;p9.41">PAR-4 is thought to be a ser/thr kinase and is distributed equally thought the cortex along with PAR-5 a 14-3-3 protein (Lyczak <hi rend="italic"> et al</hi> 2002). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.41">The function of PAR-5 is relatively unknown but when absent PAR-6 responds weakly, or not at all to its localising signals, suggesting that PAR-5 causing protein localisation (Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.41">
<s n="s1.2;p10.41">PAR-3 and PAR-6 are PDZ-containing proteins that form a complex with an atypical protein kinase C (PCK-3) and localise at the anterior cortex (Gönczy <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.41">As with PAR-2, Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> coupled PAR-6 to GFP and discovered that the complex is distributed equally throughout the cortex shortly after fertilisation (unlike PAR-2) and recedes to the anterior after centrosome rotation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.41">
<s n="s1.6;p11.41">Mutations in the <hi rend="italic">par</hi> genes generally affect other <hi rend="italic">par</hi> genes in 2 ways: by depolarising the distribution of other PAR proteins or, blocking the peripheral localisation of PAR proteins. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.41">From these mutant studies the order of function of the genes can be predicted. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.41">Rose <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1998) suggested that PAR-1 maybe the only protein required for establishing polarity, however later evidence contradicts the theory, in <hi rend="italic">par</hi>-2 mutants, the PAR-1 protein is not localised yet other down-stream maternal effect genes reliant on the PAR proteins for localisation remain correctly distributed (SKN-1 and P granules). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.41">The genetic pathway was reviewed by Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (2003), in <hi rend="italic">par-2</hi> mutants it was found that PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3 all become delocalised so were spread though the cortex. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.41">The reverse was true in the <hi rend="italic">par-3, par-6,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> pkc-3</hi> mutants where PAR-2 was not restricted to the posterior of the embryo. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.41">Cuenca <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (2003) came to the conclusion that the establishment of the anterior and posterior PAR domains depends upon antagonistic interactions between the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex in the anterior and PAR-2 at the posterior (see figure 4). </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0112f-fig.002">
<head>
<hi rend="bold">Figure 4. Sequential relationships between AP polarity components in one-cell stage embryos.</hi> Contact between the centrosome and the cortex breaks the symmetry of the zygote and results in PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 receding from the posterior in an NMY-2-dependent manner. Meanwhile, PAR-2 enrichment at the posterior occurs concomitant with that of PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 at the anterior. In turn, PAR-1 prevents MEX-5/6 accumulation at the posterior. The presence of MEX-5/6 at the anterior prevents the presence of P granules and PIE-1 on that side of the embryo, and also reinforces anterior PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 distribution. As a result of this sequence of interactions, P granules and PIE-1 are segregated to the posterior of one-cell stage embryos. Figure from: Gö nczy <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2005</head>
</figure>
<p n="p12.41">
<s n="s1.3;p12.41">Once the 1-cell polarity has been established by the PAR proteins this information needs to be translated to other maternal proteins down stream that are required for determining cell fates. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.41">This process is thought to be controlled by the proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6, these are CCCH finger proteins that act downstream of the PAR proteins by establishing maternal protein asymmetry. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.41">This protein function was suggested after observations of <hi rend="italic">mex-5;mex-6</hi> mutants, where several maternal proteins were missexpressed in the anterior of the embryo, such as MEX-1, PIE-1, and SKN-1, which are usually present in the posterior of the embryo at the 1-cell stage (Schubert <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2000). </s>
