<p n="p2.63">
<s n="s1.2;p2.63">In 1894, the idea of car racing was raised once a series of petrol-fuelled cars were constructed. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.63">The first official race was held in Chicago, Illinois on 2nd November in 1895 and racing engines were improved exponentially during the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.63">
<s n="s1.4;p3.63">Researches on different engines which usually used in racing were performed and discussed in this report. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.63">Engine used for general automotives was internal combustion (I.C.) engine in which the mechanical power of vehicle was produced by combustion of fuel within the combustion chamber. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.63">Internal combustion engine could have either two-strokes or four-strokes and either spark ignites or compression ignites. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.63">Gasoline, diesel and natural gas could be selected as the fuel in a SI engine. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.63">
<s n="s1.2;p4.63">On the other hand, two major types of IC engines were identified: Rotary engine and Reciprocating engine. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.63">The major representative of rotary engines in automotive industry was the Wankel engine (Fig 2) which was the most highly developed rotary engine since 1970s; such engine was used due to the compactness and high power performance. </s>

<p n="p5.63">
<s n="s1.2;p5.63">However, the development of Wankel engine was suspended in most of the companies due to the arising environmental regulations as well as the effect of the oil crisis. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.63">The most recent car operated by Wankel engine was the Mazda RX-7 which produced in 1999. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.63">
<s n="s1.5;p6.63">In automotive racing industry, only particular specifications were selected and employed since the efficiency could only be improved by such specifications. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.63">Different cylinder configurations such as single, in-line, v-type, w-type, u-type, opposed cylinder, opposed piston and radial could be found in IC engines. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.63">However, in-line and v-type were the most commonly used configurations in automotive racing engines. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.63">Further more, the common numbers of valves employed in each cylinder were 2 (1 intake, 1 exhaust), 4 (2 intake, 2 exhaust) and 5 (3 intake, 2 exhaust). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.63">Generally 4 valves were employed in racing engine. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.63">
<s n="s1.6;p7.63">. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.63">Compare to normal engines, limits such as peak operating cylinder pressure were pushed up in some racing engines so that a higher performance could be obtained. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.63">Besides, the horsepower and fuel economy could be increased by maximizing the cylinder pressure. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.63">Although the cylinder pressure could be increased by increasing the compression ratio, alternative technique could also be used since cylinder pressures could be altered significantly by using camshaft selection, carburetion, nitrous and supercharging. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.63">Compression pressures could be adjusted drastically by installing supercharging, turbo-charging or intercooling system. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.63">However, apart from installing extra equipment to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of racing engines, the durability and lifetime were also a significant factor to consider since racing cars might require to operation for a long time without any failures </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.63">However, high acceleration, high maximum speed, high power, high torque, light weight and high efficiency of engine cycles were generally the ideal for racing engines. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.63">For instance, high power output was necessary for rally engine since such racing might consist of climbing uphill or operating under poor conditions. </s>

<s n="s12.15;p55.63">But not long after World War 2, 125 cc bikes were built based on the previous models. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p55.63">From then, the development of the motorcycle engines was more on increasing the horsepower and the stability of the bike. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p55.63">Horsepower can be improved by changing the dimensions and configurations of the cylinders and pistons. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p55.63">While the stability is depend on the weight distributions of the bike. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Performance Analysis and Discussion</head>
<p n="p56.63">
<s n="s1.1;p56.63">The performances for each racing engine were plotted in Appendix A and the comparisons of performance for different types of racing engines were plotted in Appendix B. </s>
</p>
<p n="p57.63">
<s n="s1.4;p57.63">Firstly, all the displacements of formula and rally racing were very closed to 3000cc and 2000cc respectively, however the maximum possible values for those racing vehicle should be larger since those performances were achieved under some racing regulations. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p57.63">On the other hand, the torque and compression ratio of formula racing engines as well as the compression ratio of rally racing engines were missing on the table due to those performance might be confidential to public. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p57.63">In formula racing V10 engine were normally used since the racing engine could only consist 10 cylinders in accordance with formula racing regulation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p57.63">Most of the rally engines were employing inline configuration except for Subaru Impreza since a more efficient flat configuration was used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p58.63">
<s n="s1.6;p58.63">Further more, the combined table in Appendix represented the requirement of different racing engines. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p58.63">Ten cylinders were used in formula racing engine since the vehicle required an extremely high speed. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p58.63">Besides, the displacement of sports racing engine was enormous compared to the others, due to the corresponding vehicle (Ford GT) was an endurance racing vehicle, hence an extremely high value of displacement was reasonable. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p58.63">Conversely, the total weight of motorcycle was pretty light, therefore the fuel consumption and displacement required were not necessary to be high. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p58.63">The power of formula engine was the highest as the formula car needed to achieve a highest possible acceleration. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p58.63">On the other hand, the motorcycle power was the lowest as the weight of the vehicle was small; hence only low force and power were needed in order to drive the vehicle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p59.63">
<s n="s1.1;p59.63">Although the torque of formula engine was not available, the expected torque of formula engine should be greater than the Ford GT (500lb-ft). </s>
</p>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p60.63">
<s n="s1.2;p60.63">Firstly, Wankel engines obtained a high power performance and were familiar in automotive industry during 1990s. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p60.63">However, the development was suspended due to the arising environmental regulations and the effect of the oil crisis although the future development of this type of engine was enormous. </s>
</p>
<p n="p61.63">
<s n="s1.3;p61.63">In conclusion, the performances of different racing engines were totally depended on the type of race. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p61.63">For instance endurance vehicle would require a high displacement whereas a motorcycle would not since endurance race needed a larger capacity of fuel. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p61.63">Besides, the performance could be improved by inserting extra components such as turbocharger and cooler, by modifying/replacing the current components or by either employing specific valve configuration in order to lower the centre of gravity of the vehicle. </s>
</p>
<p n="p62.63">
<s n="s1.1;p62.63">Light weight and high strength material such as aluminium alloy could also be used so that a lighter but stiffer product could be achieved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p63.63">
<s n="s1.2;p63.63">The future development of these racing engines would be tends to increase the horsepower by developing new systems to assist the current operations. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p63.63">Improvements of racing engine could also be achieved by developing individual components such as piston, crankshaft, camshaft, head cover...etc. </s>
