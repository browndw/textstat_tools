<s n="s3.6;p1.10">A brief definition and explanation of the rule against bias will be formulated; in order to lay out a foundation in which this rule can be applied to the different facts of this case. </s>

</head>
<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.21;p2.10">The rule against bias is an aspect of natural justice that is ultimately concerned with fairness. </s>
<s n="s2.21;p2.10">De Smith, Woolf and Jowell described the rule against bias as "not only to prevent the distorting influence of actual bias, but also to protect the integrity of the decision-making process by ensuring that ... the circumstances should not give rise to the appearance or risk of bias." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.21;p2.10">This highlights the importance of not only preventing real bias but also any appearance of bias. </s>
<s n="s4.21;p2.10">The Employment Tribunal in this instance consists of George and Geoffrey; both lay members and Fiona, the chairperson of the tribunal. </s>
<s n="s5.21;p2.10">It emerges that George is married to Gareth's second cousin, but has never met Gareth and did not know of this relationship. </s>
<s n="s6.21;p2.10">The question is whether this leads to bias or an appearance of bias. </s>
<s n="s7.21;p2.10">Prior to the <hi rend="italic">Pinochet</hi> (1999) case<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.002"/> bias was predicated on the basis of pecuniary or proprietary interest which leads to automatic disqualification. </s>
<s n="s8.21;p2.10">George does not seem to have any pecuniary or proprietary interest in this case according to the facts laid out. </s>
<s n="s9.21;p2.10">There is no indication of pecuniary or proprietary interests. </s>
<s n="s10.21;p2.10">However the landmark decision in <hi rend="italic">Pinochet</hi> (1999) implies that "a similar, automatic disqualification would arise wherever a judge has a strong personal interest in the case before him." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s11.21;p2.10">It seems that George does not have a strong personal interest in Gareth's case as he had no knowledge of such a relationship as between him and Gareth. </s>
<s n="s12.21;p2.10">But it has been held that "justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s13.21;p2.10">The fact that George did not know about such a relationship does not negate the possibility of bias. </s>
<s n="s14.21;p2.10">Therefore according to this pronouncement George would be a bias party as justice should be <hi rend="bold">seen</hi> to be done. </s>
<s n="s15.21;p2.10">The correct test to be used was pronounced by Lord Hope in <hi rend="italic">Porter v Magill</hi> (2002) that states, "The question is whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased." </s>
<s n="s16.21;p2.10">According to this test a fair-minded and informed observer would most likely conclude that George was not bias even though there is a family connection. </s>
<s n="s17.21;p2.10">This is because the family relationship was not known by George and so it cannot be said that he made a judgment based on such knowledge. </s>
<s n="s18.21;p2.10">There was not even a chance for George to have been unconsciously affected by bias<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.005"/> as there had not been any explicit nor implicit information. </s>
<s n="s19.21;p2.10">It also emerges that George is a member of the same golf club as George and Gareth. </s>
<s n="s20.21;p2.10">It is safe to infer that George and Gareth have never met at the golf club since George never knew of his family connection with Gareth and had never previously met. </s>
<s n="s21.21;p2.10">So the legal analysis regarding the risk of bias by George remains intact. </s>

<s n="s2.12;p3.10">One of these companies is The Construction Company Ltd. that was a party to the proceedings in the tribunal. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p3.10">It is not certain whether Fiona personally and actively participated in consulting the latter company; whether it was on this particular issue regarding Gareth's negligence in health and safety issues. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p3.10">Assuming that Fiona did personally consult the company in the proceedings and subsequently sat as the tribunal's chair without disclosing her close involvement with one of the party to the proceedings; it would be fair to say that the decision of the tribunal would be bias. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p3.10">This is due to the important fact that Fiona's dual and intermingling functions could give rise to bias or the appearance of it. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p3.10">This is highlighted in the <hi rend="italic">Pinochet</hi> case where Lord Hoffman was automatically disqualified after disclosure that he was closely linked to Amnesty International, a party to the proceedings. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p3.10">Such is the importance of maintaining public confidence that there should not even be the appearance of bias. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s11.12;p3.10">Thus Fiona is likely to be sub-consciously biased against Gareth and favouring The Construction Company Ltd. as she had been previously involved in consulting the latter on health and safety issues concerning Gareth's negligence. </s>

<s n="s7.13;p8.10">But if indeed the EAT consisted of the same three individuals from the ET then there would "normally be a breach of natural justice where an adjudicator takes part in the determination of an appeal against one of his own decision, unless he is expressly authorised to do so by statute." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s8.13;p8.10">This is not a case in which the decision-maker has been expressly authorised by statute to further adjudicate in an appeal. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p8.10">Therefore there is a real possibility of bias when applying the test expounded in <hi rend="italic">Porter v Magill</hi> (2001). </s>
<s n="s10.13;p8.10">If however the EAT were to conduct a full and fair trial; then it would be irrelevant if there had been a failure of natural justice in the first instance. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p8.10">This was held to be the case in <hi rend="italic">Calvin v.</hi> </s>

<hi rend="italic">Carr</hi> (1980)<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p8.10">Thus Gareth would fail to establish the law on bias as a ground for judicial review as he had a full and fair hearing in the appeal stage. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p9.10">Another important aspect of the rule against bias is the right of waiver; "the act of abandoning or refraining from asserting a legal right." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s2.5;p9.10">If Gareth had known of the facts that entitled him to object but continued to allow the proceedings to continue without any protest, then he would be held to have waived his legal right to object. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.10">As such he would not be allowed to protest later based on the decision-maker being bias. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.10">It does not seem apparent that Gareth had known the essential facts and so "there is no presumption of waiver if the disqualified adjudicator failed to make a complete disclosure of his interest." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0312e-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s5.5;p9.10">Therefore Gareth does not seem to have waived his right to object in this case and can thus apply for judicial review. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p10.10">Gareth's case for judicial review based on the rule against bias seems rather bleak considering that he has already appealed to the EAT; satisfying Article 6(1) that "guarantees [were] in place". </s>
<s n="s2.10;p10.10">This would of course be a different matter if it could be shown that the EAT were themselves bias. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p10.10">Furthermore there is no conclusive evidence that Fiona was actively involved in consulting The Construction Company Ltd and so unlikely be biased. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p10.10">George's family connection with Gareth seems tenuous at best especially since George has never met Gareth and thus would not be sub-consciously or consciously biased. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p10.10">The facts show that George and Geoffrey have never met Gareth although all three of them are members of the same golf club. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p10.10">Thus there is no real possibility of bias notwithstanding membership of the same association. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p10.10">This equally applies to Geoffrey's and Gareth's possible membership of the same trade union. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p10.10">Lastly the close friendship between B and C may give rise to a possibility of bias as the former could influence her husband, Geoffrey. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p10.10">All these facts however will not assist Gareth since he had a full and fair appeal trial. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p10.10">Hence it is very likely that Gareth will be unsuccessful in judicial review. </s>
