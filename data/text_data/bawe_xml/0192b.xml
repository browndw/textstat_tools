<p n="p1.16">
<s n="s1.1;p1.16">Sensation is an impression on the consciousness from a stimulation of the senses. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.3;p2.16">Perception is the recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli based mostly on memory. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.16">A sensation does not occur without a perception following. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.16">Humans utilize their senses to perceive their surrounding environment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.5;p3.16">To make sense of their connection, one has to delve into the biological beginnings. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.16">The science of sensation is called psychophysics. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.16">Psychophysics is concerned with physical stimuli of the senses and the occurring psychological reactions. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.16">Perception is an individual incidence and to be able to study them, psychologists have reduced these perceptions to numbers. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.16">Simply put, sensation is a physical response to a stimulus that is converted to a perception in the brain. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.7;p4.16">On a very different note, an exception to the sensation/perception link is perceptual illusions. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.16">The occurrences of perceptual illusions imply that what we sense from our sense organs is not necessarily what we perceive it to be. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.16">(Sternberg, 1999) We utilize our sensory information and manipulate it in our minds to create a mental picture that connects to a previous memory. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.16">Often though, what we perceive differs from the sensory information we started out with. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.16">For example, when we look at pictures, they are on a flat surface. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.16">This visual sensory information is transmitted to our brain which then utilizes depth cues and the whole original visual sensation is manipulated to create a perception. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.16">The presence of perceptual illusions demonstrates that the information that was originally gathered from sensation is not the final perception that is made. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.7;p5.16">There are many theories that involve perception. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.16">One such theory is the Gestalt approach to forming visual perception. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.16">This was founded by Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Kohler and Max Wertheimer. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.16">This theory is based on the idea that when met with a visual array, the mind organizes all the different parts together to form a complete picture. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.16">In other words, a focal point is perceived and all the extra parts form a background for the focus. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.16">The Gestalt approach is based on five principles which are proximity, similarity, continuity, closure and symmetry. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.16">(Sternberg, 1999) </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.8;p6.16">Proximity relates to when a group of objects are seen close together, we tend to perceive them as forming a group. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.16">Similarity refers to the tendency of classifying items of similar characteristics as belonging to the same group. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.16">Continuity occurs when there is a perception of a continuous form rather than a discontinuous form. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.16">Closure refers to how we perceptually complete objects that are not complete. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.16">Symmetry relates to how we perceive objects in mirror images about their centre point. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.16">The Gestalt approach provides us with a form and pattern explanation as to how humans perceive. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.16">These five principles form the basis of any stimuli that instigate any form of perception. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p6.16">(Sternberg, 1999) </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.5;p7.16">Another form of visual perception is distance perception. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.16">Distance perception is affected by the presence of depth cues. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.16">A depth cue is used to provide information about distance in a three-dimensional world. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.16">There are five depth cues in all and they are: relative size, interposition, relative height, linear perspective and shading and shadows. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.16">(Atkinson, Atkinson, Smith, Bem and Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000) </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.10;p8.16">Relative size refers to the perception that an object of smaller size than another object, in a picture, is further away than the bigger object. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p8.16">Interposition occurs when an object obstructs the view of the other. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.16">People tend to perceive the overlapping object as closer in distance. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.16">Relative height relates to when an object is perceived closer to the horizon than others in the picture, it is further away. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.16">Linear perspective occurs when two parallel lines converge; people tend to perceive the lines as vanishing in the distance. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.16">Shadows and shading are another important cue about object shapes and distances between objects and the light source. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.16">These five cues come together to provide information about images. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.16">Artists have used these cues for many years in their paintings to convey perceptions about distance and size. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.16">Depth cues are also often used in the trick of illusion. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p8.16">(Atkinson, Atkinson, Smith, Bem and Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000) </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.16">
<s n="s1.11;p9.16">Another theory about perception is Gibson's theory of direct perception. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p9.16">(Sternberg, 1999) The theory states that all one needs for perception to occur is a visual system and an environment in which to operate. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p9.16">All the cues necessary for perception to take place, are already present in the environment, and it is not necessary to invoke any higher cognitive processes. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.16">For instance, depth and distance information can be determined by their regularity of surfaces. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p9.16">In this case, the person's perception is immediate and spontaneous. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p9.16">For example, people can instantly recognize unfamiliar but biologically relevant stimuli. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p9.16">Also, information for perception can only be obtained through movement, since, the perceptual information derived from motion leads to a more accurate action in the future. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p9.16">This viewpoint excludes intelligence from the process of perception. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p9.16">It is stated that any information about the object being viewed can be inferred from the stimulus informant. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p9.16">Intelligence only comes during the cognitive processing but only after perceptual processing has been completed. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p9.16">Hence, this model views perception and intelligence as two separate entities and processes that may possibly be sequential but not simultaneously. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.16">
<s n="s1.5;p10.16">An additional theory about perception is known as the template theory which states that humans have pre-stored sets of templates which are highly detailed models for patterns that allow for easy recognition. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.16">When observing something, we mentally compare it to templates and try to match our observations with the pre-stored templates. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.16">We then select the template that completely corresponds to our observation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.16">It is in this way that we perceive our surroundings. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.16">(Sternberg, 1999) </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.16">
<s n="s1.10;p11.16">In contrast to the template theory, there are feature theories. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p11.16">These theories state that unlike template theory, we do not match entire patterns to a template but instead match features of a pattern to features stored in memory. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p11.16">An example of such a theory is "pandemonium" formed by Oliver Selfridge in 1959. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p11.16">The theory states that neural clusters "shriek" to indicate the presence of particular features of the perceived stimulus. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p11.16">Each of these neurons or neural clusters were referred to as a "demon". </s>
<s n="s6.10;p11.16">"Image demons" would pass on an image to "feature demons". </s>
<s n="s7.10;p11.16">"Feature demons" were specialized to respond to aspects of an observation that matched particular features. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p11.16">The "volume" at which each demon shrieks in response to a match in the feature of the observation will depend crucially upon the amount of evidence available for the presence of that feature. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p11.16">The pandemonium of shrieks will then be interpreted by a "decision demon", whose job is to "perceive" (that is, decide on the basis of the evidence) which letter was actually present in the original stimulus. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p11.16">(Sternberg, 1999) </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.16">
<s n="s1.8;p12.16">A theory that is a completely different approach to perception is known as constructive perception. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.16">Constructive perception involves the formation of perception by means of sensory information gathered as the foundation for the structure. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.16">Coupled with other sources of information, a cognitive understanding of the stimulus is formed. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.16">With this viewpoint, intelligence plays a big role in the forming of a perception. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.16">During perception, we apply three different sources. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.16">We base our perceptions on what we sense from the observation, any prior knowledge stored in memory and what we can infer using cognitive processes. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.16">These processes are known as unconscious inference. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p12.16">Unconscious inference occurs when we unconsciously make use of information from a variety of sources to infer and create a perception. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.16">
<s n="s1.1;p13.16">(Sternberg, 1999) </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.16">
<s n="s1.9;p14.16">The link between sensation and perception is distinctly significant. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.16">One cannot occur without the other. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.16">Sensory information is always gathered before being transmitted to the brain to form a perception. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.16">There are many theories about the different types of perception and their formation. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p14.16">There is the Gestalt approach to visual perception. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p14.16">This theory revolves around the five principles which are proximity, similarity, continuity, closure and symmetry. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.16">The five principles are utilized for perceptual organization. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.16">Depth cues are a major factor in distance perception. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p14.16">The presence of depth cues helps us to infer information about a 2D picture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.16">
<s n="s1.7;p15.16">The theory of direct perception suggests that we only require the use of our sensory receptors to form perceptions. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p15.16">The template theory states that our minds have stored templates which we use to recognize patterns of our observations. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.16">These templates help to form perceptions. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.16">On the other hand, there is another type of theory which differs from template theory known as feature theory. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.16">Feature theory is different from template theory in that it says humans match features of patterns to templates stored in memory rather than an entire pattern. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.16">Conversely, there is another theory known as constructive perception which is based on the idea of unconscious inference. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.16">Unconscious inference is the application of information from a variety of sources to create a perception. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.2;p16.16">In summation, with every theory, perception comes about after sensation has occurred. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.16">Sensory information is gathered from the senses and transmitted to the brain which then transposes all the information to form a perception. </s>
