<s n="s4.4;p94.100">Furthermore, Bhimanial. (2002, p. 336) point out that <hi rend="italic">"by identifying the cost of performing each activity, ABC system seek a greater level of detail in understanding how an organisation uses its resources".</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p95.100">Using ABC method in the "Winning Margin <hi rend="sup">TM</hi>", could have been proved quite useful. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p95.100">Factors such as production cost (i.e. machines' set-up, machines' hours, demand of raw materials) and investments needed (i.e. new machines, suppliers development) in order to develop this new product, were completely ignored, since the team thought that achieving high sales in high prices would bring profit. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p95.100">But since the results were different from the expected ones, the implementation of ABC may have helped team to make a more circumstantial decision, taking into account the different activities necessary for the new final product, and the cost that these activities were generating in relationship with the product's potential profit. </s>

<p n="p96.100">
<s n="s1.2;p96.100">In the complex real world, ABC can deter companies from either undercost <hi rend="italic">("makes sales that result in losses")</hi> or overcost products <hi rend="italic">("risk of losing market share")</hi> (Bhimanial. 2002, p. 332), by taking into account cost elements which traditional cost methods overlook. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p96.100">Thus, ABC methodology can be a very useful tool for the modern companies. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p99.100">The investment in new machines was based on the production rate of the particular type of machines that the team bought. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p99.100">However, the team could have take into account factors such as the initial investment and the future cashflows on examining the alternative types of machines that were on sale; thus making a different, but more profitable choice. </s>
