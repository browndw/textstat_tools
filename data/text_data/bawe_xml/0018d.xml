<s n="s4.4;p161.163">However, the computer program only offered a limited number of variables which meant the flexibility was limited even such program run normally. </s>

<p n="p162.163">
<s n="s1.5;p162.163">Nevertheless, manual calculations enable a more flexible and reliable analysis during design process, hence the volume of the gear box could be minimized more easily. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p162.163">After a range of manual calculations, the gearbox could be operated as requested from 1800rpm to ~90rpm, using a double reduction gearbox with gear ratios of ~4.472. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p162.163">After that, the minimal gear diameters of 36mm and 161mm with 27mm thickness were selected for small and large gears respectively. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p162.163">Such values were then utilized for shaft analysis and hence bearing analysis near the final stage. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p162.163">Finally, two 25mm and one 12mm diameter shafts with 100mm length were chosen for gearbox shafts and 6 bearings (25mm and 12mm diameter with 37.5mm and 18mm thickness respectively) were selected to support the corresponding shafts. </s>

<p n="p163.163">
<s n="s1.2;p163.163">The gearbox design was then constructed in SolidWorks, CAD drawing was then produced in order to minimize the required gearbox housing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p163.163">A size of<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0018d-form.103"/> was used for the housing and a thickness of 12mm was reserved as a safety basis. </s>
