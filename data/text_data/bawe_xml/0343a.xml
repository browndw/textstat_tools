<p n="p7.20">
<s n="s1.2;p7.20">In the competitive environment and faithful accountability requirement, an effective information management is required to control the capacity of information and to capture the competent evidence in the first place for the organisational success. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.20">Good information management system, with an efficient management of both the quality and quantity of the information which links the organisation's routine processes, will ensure interoperability in corporation (Deserno &amp; Kynaston, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.4;p8.20">The first benefit of an effective information management system is that a coordinating information management will generates significant capitals as a key competitive value in a knowledge-based economy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.20">Transferred from broadly intangible resources (such as financial date, employee competencies, organisations structure and relationships) into explicit knowledge (records), the commercial wisdom and learning are ready for a maximized share by people (Adequate Records management 2006, para 8-11). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.20">An efficient information management system can facilitate organizational collaboration to improve outcomes, plus pass on integrated information to support strategic success. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p9.20">For instance, it assists the business continuity and progress disaster-recovery. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.20">The availability of effective records ensures new staff can be acquainted with the ground running quickly; it improves the retention of knowledge for subsequent action when staffs retire or move posts; senior managers can access file materials out-of-hours and respond more effectively to urgency when support staff are unavailable (McLeod, 1990, pp.108-117). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.20">Properly organized and maintained information - in paper and electronic formats - will ensure the accountability to protect the organisation and its assets (as human assets, financial assets, physical assets, IT assets, relationship assets) from the risks of misrepresenting or losing data and reduce the extremely high cost of 'dirty data' ( date is inaccurate, inconsistent and out of date). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.20">(Adequate Records management 2006, para 8-13) </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.20">
<s n="s1.2;p10.20">These managing processes, to identify, organize, maintain, access and properly dispose the information to control the quantity of the records, will pays off in cost savings: the more efficient use of the available storage capacity, faster retrieval and sustained accessibility to corporate information (McLeod, 1990, pp.4-6). </s>

<head rend="bold">4. Future Work in Launching an Effective Information Management System </head>
<p n="p14.20">
<s n="s1.1;p14.20">An information management and organisational governance can be captured effectively and efficiently through starting an information governance framework as the benchmarks, introducing an electronic information management system and setting up a comprehensive information management reinforced program. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.20">
<s n="s1.4;p15.20">To start with, the priority is to place an information governance framework as benchmarks. </s>

<p n="p16.20">
<s n="s1.3;p16.20">Generally, complying with the best practice standards for good benchmarks can be a shortcut with practised and systematic guidelines to manage information system, such as the international quality assurance standards (ISO 9000), professional and industry standards and codes of practice, as well as voluntary codes of practice of general applicability (e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.20">Privacy Charter for protecting privacy). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.20">These are three key principles should govern the information management practice: the principle of provenance - keep contextual relationships of records for integrity, the principle of original order - the order is evidentiary trail of a transaction, and the principle of the responsible chain of custody-- set obligation to guarantee the safety (Adequate Records Management, 2006, para 10). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.20">
<s n="s1.7;p17.20">Additionally, a vital process followed by is to launch an electronic information management system (see Table 1). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.20">As a large multinational organisation, all current records stored in hard copy leastways may impel corporation suffer from inefficient retrievals because of the huge records stored across the boundaries. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.20">Moreover, it is indispensable to choose cross-references that make organizing structures cover both paper documents and electronic groupings of records at the same time. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.20">By introducing electronic standard recoding procedures, the corporate governance capability can be more successfully enforced, on recording, accessing and sharing documents in electronic format, as well as the retrieval time, than in paper surrounding long distance embranchments (Jevec, 2005, para 4-7). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.20">Thus, an e-government and e-commerce can be achievable over time. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.20">Allow staffs to search for an electronic document by keywords, or by authority can impact a dramatic improvement in convenience and productivity, which will enhance the use of documents and records as a corporate information source. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p17.20">Furthermore, the accommodation environment will improve as storage requirements reduce. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p18.20">Initially, the organisation could come up with plans and timetables, exam the business workflow and assess the functional requirements through a need-analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.20">Obtaining organisation staffs' support is a key step here. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.20">Then, train users involved in the pc implementation to provide appropriate understanding and supporting of new work practices and new information management system in organisation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.20">
<s n="s1.6;p19.20">Secondly, the organisation possibly will seek expert advice in developing the implementation process which can be effective. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.20">However, it is a practical way to outsource the information management reinforce program to a committed agency. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.20">Additionally, organisation needs to set up effective back-up procedures to provide a security arrangement and a disaster recovery plan in relation to hard paper and electronic documents for minimizing the risk of loss, corruption and unauthorized access (Pearce, 2005, para. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.20">50-90). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.20">Ideally, such a task of setting a good information management system should be undertaken as a clearly-identified corporate review at key intervals (ranging from an enhancement of existing 'good benchmarks' procedures to user participation and satisfaction) and a further reinforcement program (Jevec, n.d., para. </s>
