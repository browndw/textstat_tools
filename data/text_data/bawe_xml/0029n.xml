<s n="s1.2;p1.36">The <hi rend="italic">Collins English Dictionary</hi> defines the word 'doom' as <hi rend="italic">to condemn to death or a terrible to fate</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.36">Although many Native Americans still live in North America today, proving that as a race they have not been eradicated, their culture and significance have been eroded to such a degree that they can be deemed to have suffered a <hi rend="italic">terrible fate</hi> as a people. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.36">
<s n="s1.12;p2.36">For several millennia Native Americans prospered on the continent of North America without interference. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p2.36">In the early sixteenth century, however, they came into contact with Europeans and within a few centuries they had effectively been wiped out. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.36">It cannot be denied that it was the Europeans settlers who caused the demise of the Native American peoples. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.36">But was it inevitable? </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.36">Could they have survived the presence of European explorers and settlers on their shores? </s>
<s n="s6.12;p2.36">This essay will argue that they were ultimately doomed but not, however, from the outset, in that they could have taken measures to ensure their own future and push the settlers from their continent, as it was impossible for the two cultures to co-exist. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p2.36">A vast array of factors combined to cause the demise of the Natives, all of which will be given close attention in this study. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p2.36">These include European diseases, missionaries promoting Christianity, the superior technology and weapons at the disposal of the colonists and trade between the two peoples. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p2.36">These all had devastating effects on the Native Americans and meant that in the long-term they were doomed, particularly due to the dependence that developed out of trade with the Europeans. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p2.36">However, had the Natives actively and forcibly resisted European settlement on their land from the start, it is highly likely that they could have prevented their downfall. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p2.36">The colonists were almost utterly dependent on the Natives for survival in the early years of settlement. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p2.36">Without this life support, it was they who would have been doomed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.36">
<s n="s1.7;p3.36">One of the most devastating factors in the eventual demise of the Native Americans was that of disease. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.36">In terms of resistance to disease, North America was a virgin land through which pandemics were able to sweep. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.36">Once the disease-bearing Europeans arrived, there was massive devastation, accounting for millions of deaths. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.36">Any survivors were significantly weakened when facing European colonization. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.36">Through a series of calculations, Henry F. Dobyns estimates the Native American population to number eighteen million before European contact. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.36">This number is huge considering that 'by the late nineteenth century only about one quarter to one-third million Native Americans survived'.<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.001"/> Disease was the prime factor in this massive population decrease. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.36">Indeed, it has been described as 'the greatest catastrophe in history, far exceeding even the disaster of the Black Death of medieval Europe'.<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.002"/> Sickness made conquest far easier for the European settlers. </s>

<s n="s1.13;p4.36">Smallpox was the most lethal pathogen introduced by Europeans to North America in terms of the number of casualties. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p4.36">As with the vast majority of diseases brought to North America by the Europeans, Native Americans were one hundred per cent susceptible. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p4.36">Dobyns states that the 1617 Native American population of Florida probably numbered only five per cent of the 1517 population, indicating how vulnerable the Natives were to disease. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p4.36">This was noticeable to the Spanish explorers who first came to settle here during the 1590s and found that the East Coast of Florida was almost entirely deserted. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p4.36">The most terrifying aspect of disease was that it wreaked most harm before there were even European settlements in North America - 'Native American depopulation during the sixteenth century far exceeded that of later times." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s6.13;p4.36">It was often first transferred by European explorers and fishermen and was spread by Native Americans themselves. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p4.36">Deadly illnesses devastated Natives weeks and even years before they came into direct contact with foreigners. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p4.36">Many fled to escape disease but unwittingly helped to transfer it. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p4.36">The area from Florida to New England has been described as an 'epidemic region' since disease spread unmitigated along the coast as tribes interacted frequently, giving reason as to why so many of the estimated eighteen million Native Americans were killed by disease. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p4.36">Noble David Cook estimates that more than ninety percent of Natives were killed by foreign infection. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p4.36">Disease was also transferred during trade between Europeans and Native Americans and when Natives traded among themselves. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p4.36">Many who fell ill but did not die directly from disease, were physically unable to fetch food or water, or even tend crops, so died anyway due to starvation or dehydration in combination with the fever-generating pathogen. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p4.36">Also the Native American practice of visiting sick relatives and friends only helped to spread the disease further. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p5.36">Many of the epidemics were continentwide." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s4.7;p5.36">The fact that, especially during the sixteenth century, visits to North America were sporadic was accountable for this. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.36">After a disease such as smallpox had affected the Native population, which had gained a degree of immunity as a result, it might be decades before the same disease struck again, meaning that that the population was at great risk, particularly the younger generations who lacked resistance. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.36">This was devastating to the survival of the Native Americans. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.36">Disease also weakened Natives who were more liable to succumb to other, normally less deadly, infections. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.36">Disease undermined Native American faith in the superiority of themselves over the Europeans and in their Gods. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.36">They saw epidemics as divine punishment for human transgressions. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.36">As the Europeans did not seem to be afflicted on such a scale, they concluded that 'the God about whom the Christians talked in fact possessed greater power than their own'.<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.005"/> Many Native Americans even blamed clergymen for the disease that was afflicting them in such great numbers. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.36">They believed missionaries were able to control sickness and health. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.36">This had grave consequences - 'Alien disease did more than decimate the native population; it effectively prepared the way for subsequent phases of European contact by breaking native morale and, perhaps even more significantly, by cracking their spiritual edifice." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s6.7;p6.36">Another way in which disease affected Native Americans was that technical skills, leadership, and the group's corporate memory were lost when adult members died, especially elders who possessed the least resistance. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.36">Disease and its consequences could even lead to the dissolution of whole tribes - 'the demographic losses combined with the psychological shock and cosmological confusion... cause[d] the collapse of aboriginal Southeastern cultures.'<ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<quote lang="English">During the 1650s the political barriers that had restrained English settlement... gradually disappeared; colonists began to move in. Soon the Indians, who up to this point had had very little contact with the English except through trade, were confronted with several small but rapidly growing settlements on prime land that the Indians considered to be theirs. <ref target="BAWE_0029n-ftnote.050"/>

<s n="s6.9;p34.36">This process gave increasing power to the Europeans over the Native Americans, the beginnings of which can even be seen with Jamestown in the first half of the seventeenth century. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p34.36">On 18 April 1644 nearly five hundred settlers were killed, but by this time, the colony was too strong to be severely affected, as the population probably numbered around ten thousand. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p35.36">Therefore, in conclusion, there was a vast array of factors which led to the demise of the Native Americans, the most important of which was not in effect from the outset. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p35.36">Native Americans outnumbered the colonists for many decades in North America despite disease; Christianity did not make as great inroads into Native life as has been previously claimed; and European technology, although superior, did not always give them considerable advantages when in battle with Natives. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p35.36">Perhaps, one could argue, that trade was the most powerful weapon that the Europeans were able to wield - more powerful than disease, Christianity and weaponry. </s>
