<s n="s1.4;p1.71">Parity conditions play a key role in the comprehension of international financial markets and in a decision maker's strategic posture towards the markets. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.71">The parity conditions are 'benchmarks'. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.71">When they hold, they imply points of indifference between two financial choices and when invalid they indicate market forces favoring one alternative over another. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.71">Empirical analysis and evidence on departures from parity are most intriguing, as a violation of parity implies that opportunities exist which can be exploited or arbitraged away. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.71">
<s n="s1.3;p2.71">Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a theory of exchange rate determination; a way to compare the average costs of goods and services between countries. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.71">The theory assumes that the actions of traders, motivated by cross-country price differences, induce changes in the exchange rate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.71">In another vein, PPP suggests that transactions on a country's current account, affect the value of the exchange rate on the foreign exchange market. </s>

<p n="p3.71">
<s n="s1.2;p3.71">The Law of one price (LOP) forms the foundation of the PPP theory, which states that in the absence of transportation and other transaction costs, competitive markets will equalize the price of an identical good in two countries, expressed in the same currency. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.71">Where St is the nominal exchange rate expressed as the domestic price of the foreign currency. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.71">The absolute version, states that the exchange rate is equal to the ratio of prices of the two countries in the long run. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.71">Another form - Relative PPP, suggests that the percentage change in the exchange rate is equal to the percentage change in the price for two countries. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.71">This theory suggests that exchange rates act in a way to counteract changes in the price levels between countries and equilibrate the purchasing power of the currencies. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p11.71">PPP implies that the nominal exchange rate is equivalent to the difference in price levels. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.71">Consequently, short run deviations are equal to the log of the exchange rate plus the difference in price levels where <hi rend="italic">d</hi> represents short run deviations from PPP. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p14.71">If <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is equal to zero, then PPP subsists. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.71">An important consequence of PPP is that the RER between countries should not vary in the long run: Arbitrage and other effects should act to negate differences in purchasing power. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.71">These long run stabilizing forces implied by PPP thus make stationarity a vital consequence to the theory. </s>

<p n="p15.71">
<s n="s1.13;p15.71">Empirical evidence about the validity of the PPP hypothesis has produced mixed results and developed along with advances in econometric techniques. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p15.71">Empirical tests confirm that PPP is a poor description of exchange rate behaviour in the short run due to exchange rate volatility and sticky prices, but in the longer run, PPP offers a good guide. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p15.71">The LOP was tested by the Big Mac Index published in 'The Economist'. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p15.71">This 'Hamburger standard' shows the difference in the average price of a Big Mac in various countries. </s>

<s n="s6.13;p15.71">Frankel (1980) found evidence in favour of PPP in hyperinflationary countries and no evidence for countries with low and moderate inflation. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p15.71">Examination of the RER equation provided the need for stationarity. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p15.71">This is - currencies go through periods of undervaluation and overvaluation that can be large, but there is tendency for PPP to reassert itself as time passes. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p15.71">Such investigations have tested the hypothesis of non-mean reversion against the alternative of mean reversion. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p15.71">Roll (1979) and Adler also tested the hypothesis that PPP follows a random walk. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p15.71">Kenneth Rogoff (1996) suggests that for a broad sample of countries, deviations from PPP maybe around 3 to 5 years, PPP deviations dampen out at the rate of 15% per year. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p15.71">According to Mark Taylor and David Peel (2000) the speed of return to PPP may increase when the deviation is larger. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p15.71">Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) posited the productivity differential model concluding that the biggest difficulty in testing PPP is that the RER may change, thus leading to the failure of PPP. </s>
