<s n="s3.5;p2.54">Second, that the Levellers were prepared to compromise their position on the franchise according to political events and to secure the acceptance of other equally important parts of their programme, and thus their standpoint changed. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.54">This essay will focus on evidence from the authoritative documents on the franchise, the <hi rend="italic">Agreements of the People</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the Case of the Armie Truly Stated</hi>, and a plethora of other Leveller tracts and especially the debates at Putney, around which MacPherson's argument centres. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.54">An attempt will be made, therefore, not only to dispute much of MacPherson's argument, but to propose a different hypothesis of how the Levellers interpreted franchise reform, based around the notions of compromise and heterogeneity. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p28.54">Where social and legal relations were being described, he argues, the most natural term for a wage-earner was servant, as it described on part of the master-servant relation, which had been in usage far before relations of a contractual nature were common.<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.060"/> Yet, Thomas argues that the contemporary usage of the term servant was inconsistent, and reflected the antiquated vocabulary describing feudal relations of the master and servant, being related to the new employee and wage-earner association.<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.061"/> This is also highlighted in MacPherson's other reason in asserting the 'general rule', that there was a lack of any other suitable term, as 'some word was needed to denote those described in our day as wage-earners'.<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.062"/> Labourer, for example, was sometimes used in this context, but it was generally not suitable as it could have a status connotation reflecting those a grade below skilled tradesmen. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p53.54">The aim of this essay has been not only to highlight many of the problems of MacPherson's thesis, but also to propose an alternative interpretation of Leveller franchise reform proposals. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p53.54">MacPherson's analysis centres round his understanding of the proceedings at the Putney debates. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p53.54">He uses remarks made by Petty on the exclusion of servants and alms-takers to argue that the Levellers assumed such exclusions throughout the debates and infers such an interpretation on pamphlets published before Putney, which include no such qualifications. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p53.54">The main criticism of this understanding has been levelled at his use of Petty as representative for the rest of the movement. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p53.54">Moreover greater controversy has surrounded his assertion that the term servant meant all wage-earners. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p53.54">There is much evidence that has been highlighted to question such an understanding, and it seems that 'this was simply not the intention of the Levellers'.<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.139"/> For MacPherson's analysis does not consider the great social changes that were occurring in this period; the Levellers 'are more likely to have been thinking in terms of a social order that was passing away than one still incompletely developed'.<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.140"/> Thus the Levellers only intend to exclude domestic servants from the franchise. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p53.54">There is also a certain amount of uncertainty regarding the exclusion of alms-takers, for it appears that the Levellers only wanted to exclude beggars and those habitually dependent on alms relief. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p53.54">MacPherson has therefore vastly over exaggerated the number of men that the Levellers would have excluded from the franchise, under their non-servant franchise proposals. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p53.54">MacPherson took his thesis further by attempting to find an underlying theory that guided their franchise demands. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p53.54">His proposal for a Leveller theory of the 'self-propriety' of labour seems to have some credibility when analysed in the case of servants, but it does not explain why beggars and soldiers would have been enfranchised and not supporters of the King. </s>

<s n="s1.13;p54.54">Not only does this highlight the main problem with MacPherson's thesis, but illustrates one of two fundamental factors that this essay has stressed as vital in understanding the Levellers and the franchise. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p54.54">The Levellers were political realists, willing to compromise on specific issues if it meant that there was more chance of the acceptance of their programme as a whole. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p54.54">Throughout their short political life the Levellers had changed their demands accordingly with political developments; the final goal was more important than single issues. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p54.54">The Levellers 'adopted a democratic stance when they believed it was indispensable to their purposes, and equally they abandoned it when it was a hindrance to their achievement'.<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.141"/> What also needs to be stressed is that when the Levellers are analysed it must be understood that they were not the homogenous movement necessary for MacPherson's thesis. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p54.54">They came together with shared grievances, but often they did not share the same solutions. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p54.54">The Levellers were thus 'a more heterogeneous party advocating a programme that has not been fully worked out in all its details, but prepared to make a series of compromises to achieve its ends." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0040c-ftnote.142"/>
<s n="s7.13;p54.54">Thus any attempt to discover a single principle that guided the Levellers on the issue of the franchise would seem fruitless, for there were a myriad of opinions. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p54.54">Yet certain generalisations can be made. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p54.54">The Levellers were not necessarily all democrats, although it was manhood suffrage that was being discussed at Putney, but they strove to create an egalitarian order. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p54.54">There would be greater opportunity to own property in a Leveller society, and thus people would not be reliant on others for wage-labour or alms. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p54.54">The voting body would be widely extended, significantly more than stated by MacPherson under the non-servant franchise for there would be fewer servants and beggars, and thus there would be greater political participation, heightened by a decentralised state. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p54.54">Thus it is questionable whether so much emphasis should be placed simply on their proposals for franchise reform. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p54.54">They proposed an incredibly radical and 'modern' set of ideals that were far more important than one issue, proposing a written constitution that England has not adopted to this day. </s>
