<s n="s1.2;p2.74">__The most eminent flaw seen in the proposal of Systech Intl. lied in the scope of the project. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.74">Though a substantial amount (Â£ 700,000) of funds were provided, the ideas and scope chosen for the service were not big or imaginative enough so as to utilize the cash reserves profitably. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p3.74">
<s n="s1.1;p3.74">__Though the chosen sector of IT services holds promise, but inclusion of Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC's) services and service centres (IBM &amp; Dell) makes the project less lucrative as the chances of developing a core competency diminishes. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p4.74">
<s n="s1.1;p4.74">__Out of all the services given by Systech Intl., the software services sector is the most viable but this fact is not built upon in the proposal where only a mere mention of ERP sale and purchase consultancy is given without delving on the intricacies involved. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.74">
<s n="s1.2;p5.74">__ Systech's proposal does include some innovative ideas like the Employee Development Programme (EDP), which provides the opportunity for two of its employees for further study. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.74">The categorization of services into Club, Premier and Economy is also a good way of giving solutions to each customer according to their needs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.74">
<s n="s1.1;p6.74">The market for the software/IT services is highly competitive so targeting the right sectors and developing partnerships is critically important for any organization even more so for a start up like Systech Intl. </s>

<p n="p9.74">
<s n="s1.2;p9.74">Greenley (1986) suggests that the mission statement has several aims, including: to provide the purpose for the organization; to express the philosophy that will guide the business; the articulate the vision of where the firm will be in the future; to define the business domain, i.e., the customer groups and needs, and the technology to be employed; and to motivate employees by providing them with a clear sense of purpose and direction. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p10.74">The vision statement of SI was good and bad in parts. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.74">Though it did capture the essence of a services company i.e. to be customer focussed, it lacked the insight required to be the driving force behind the company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.74">
<s n="s1.1;p11.74">The following mission statement, like the previous one, captures the essence of the relationship between SI and its customers while succinctly explaining the new focus area for the company. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p16.74">The strategy of SI's proposed plan was very rightly based on being customer focused as this could prove to be a critical competitive advantage, specially in a sector like software services where there are both small and big companies competing for the market share. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.74">Hence the following shall be the core strategy of the company. </s>

<head>3.1.1 The software vs. software services Industry</head>
<p n="p17.74">
<s n="s1.3;p17.74">The software services providers, though being a part of the software sector have very different business models. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.74">They experience less significant economies of scale. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.74">They have a highly variable cost structure and mid-to-low gross margins (25% for system integrators, 35% for outsourcers), as their delivery model is more customised to clients' needs and more people-intensive whereas software has very significant returns to scale with relatively high gross margins (typically around 80%) (Sector Competitive Analysis Report 2004, p.6) making software development a more lucrative market to be into. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p18.74">Analysts expect the industry to grow at a "modest rate of 7% for 2003-2007" (Sector Competitive Analysis Report 2004, p.10). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.74">This shows that the software services sector, which anyways works on a tight margin, can expect to have even tighter margins making it a dicey proposition from a profitability perspective. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.74">
<s n="s1.1;p19.74">If we take a look at table 1 below, we clearly see that software services has the lion's share of the industry with 56.3%, but as stated above have only about 25%-35% margin making it more labour intensive. </s>

<p n="p21.74">

<head>3.1.3 Future of the sector</head>
<p n="p23.74">
<s n="s1.2;p23.74">The global computer services market is maturing, with growth rates dropping from the mid teens in the late 1990s (15% CAGR 1997-2000)1 to single digits more recently (2% CAGR 2001-03), with the system integration sub-sector being more affected than the outsourcing one. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p24.74">As the system integration services mature during the next few years it is imperative for Systech Intl. to branch into software development and find new sectors to provide services to which again is an onerous task considering that market share, growth and profits only come after obtaining a certain level of expertise which comes usually after quite a few years. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p50.74">There are various sectors/markets to target for SI as fig.4 shows ranging from media/comm. to financial services. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p50.74">It is important to compare and understand the software services needs of both as both have their own model so that SI could target the right sector. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.74">
<s n="s1.2;p51.74">In manufacturing companies, the use of software is more standardised without much customisation so system integration services tend to be more standardised and therefore lower cost (Sector Competitive Analysis Report 2004, p.64). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p51.74">This makes it more viable for a start up like Systech Intl. as it minimizes the vagaries &amp; risks involved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.74">
<s n="s1.4;p52.74">The financial services on the other hand, software tends to be company-specific leading to a high level of custom application development and application integration. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p52.74">In addition, due to large transaction volumes, applications are developed on platforms that are complex and difficult to deploy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p52.74">Thus the system integration services mix in financial services tends to command a price premium over, for example, standard ERP implementations or mid-range server farm deployments (Sector Competitive Analysis Report 2004, p.63). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p52.74">This makes the finance sector more profitable but also increases the risks involved in undertaking work. </s>
</p>
<p n="p53.74">
<s n="s1.4;p53.74">The challenge for SI is to clearly reason out what it wants to do. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p53.74">Does it be safer and chose a manufacturing sector? </s>
<s n="s3.4;p53.74">Or does it target the more premium financial services sector and increase risks involved? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p53.74">Or does it make one of the industries as its base for now and move on to the other after a few years? </s>
