<s n="s2.2;p22.24">Also, the frontal area of each car was estimated given the dimensions - there was no simple way of working this out. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.24">
<s n="s1.1;p23.24">If more repetitions were carried out, then a more definite graphical representation would be attained; as it stands, any 'peak' is entirely averaged. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.24">
<s n="s1.2;p24.24">Ideally, this routine would be continued until a design was reached whereby it would be difficult to find any further improvements in aerodynamic efficiency. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.24">The final tests for ultimate streamline would have to take into account the Bernoulli equation, which suggests that at the greatest possible aerodynamic peak, the Dynamic Pressure is equal to the Static Pressure, therefore there being no energy losses due to air resistance. </s>
