<head>Assessment of Computer Aided Analysis vs. Manual Techniques</head>
<p n="p26.30">
<s n="s1.4;p26.30">As demonstrated above, computer simulation packages such as COSMOS can provide valuable information during the design process, which can enable a design to be optimised for a particular function. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.30">Modern techniques described previously, require many models to be fabricated in order to assess the performance of each design. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.30">This process can be very time consuming, and expensive, in terms of material usage, with many photopolymer resins costing upwards of £200 per litre. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.30">Computer aided simulation eliminates this requirement, therefore reducing the design time, and cutting cost. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.30">
<s n="s1.5;p27.30">The COSMOS tool uses the finite element method to solve each problem, in terms of the stresses and strains. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.30">The finite element method involves the discretisation of a continuous medium into a mesh, and the application of matrix methods to solve for the applied boundary conditions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.30">The processing time of the solution depends primarily on the complexity of the model, computer performance and the mesh size. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.30">The mesh size also has a direct affect on the accuracy of the simulation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.30">For instance, a coarse mesh will produce quicker solution times; where as a fine mesh produces more realistic results, but may require vast computing power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.30">
<s n="s1.4;p28.30">The simulation of any problem using COSMOS requires that the loads and restraints be as close as possible to the actual problem. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.30">This requires that the designer must have sufficient perception of the types of loads and restraints that will be applied in real life. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.30">This alone can produce un-reliable results, for example in the skin insertion test described previously; the skin is modelled to be fixed on all sides. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.30">This may not accurately represent the way in which the skin behaves, and so the test may only produce very approximate results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.30">
<s n="s1.1;p29.30">Similarly the non-linear model of human skin which is approximated may not accurately represent the multi-layered aspect of human skin, where as an actual insertion test would produce much more reliable results, although at a higher cost. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.30">
<s n="s1.5;p30.30">Ultimately, the use of COSMOS can provide a valuable contribution to the design process, although it should not replace the manual methods entirely. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.30">The use of simulations can greatly reduce the cost of producing many prototypes, but the simulation can only approximate the performance of each design. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.30">Computer aided analysis in this case is best used to compare designs, and eliminate poor models early on in the design process. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.30">The analysis is also very good at considering the affect of each parameter (tip radius, bore diameter etc) and optimising their selection. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.30">However, manual methods should be maintained during the design process, as the only certain way of accurately assessing the suitability of each design to the application. </s>
