<s n="s2.3;p8.20">Two singlet peaks would be present if the structure was planar, but the appearance of the doublet means that the methyl protons must project above and below the [PdCl <hi rend="sub">2</hi>] plane where they will be in different environments. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p12.20">One methyl group on each of the ligands is now directed inwards and so inside the aromatic area of the structure, aromaticity is a property of the free circulation of electrons in a -system that creates a ring current. </s>
