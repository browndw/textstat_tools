</p>
<p n="p14.52">
<s n="s1.7;p14.52">The risk of increased training costs (due to resistance to the project) has a medium impact because reducing costs is an important objective of the project. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p14.52">However I also feel a strategy of allowing, and thereby setting aside some contingency funds for this eventuality is also appropriate. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.52">The risk of the project being delayed is due to several uncertainties and so mitigation and allowing is suitable here. </s>
