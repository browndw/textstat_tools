<p n="p1.24">
<s n="s1.7;p1.24">The term "Logos" is notoriously enigmatic. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.24">Its meaning is not clear, and can be interpreted in several ways. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.24">Possible meanings include <hi rend="italic">word</hi>, <hi rend="italic">statement</hi>, <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">law.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.24">Generally a <hi rend="italic">logos</hi> is something that is said, but in Heraclitus' thought its meaning is much more fundamental and important. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.24">The work of Heraclitus is open to almost as many interpretations as the word Logo <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and indeed it is no wonder that he chose such a word as the basis for his writing. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.24">In the following interpretation of Heraclitus, the idea of Logos shall be taken to mean the unified being that is the true nature of the world. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.24">It is this definition which is vital to Heraclitus' ideas, and has a bearing on his notion of the nature of reality; the effect of language on our conception of that reality and his ideas about the path to true knowledge. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.4;p2.24">The key ideas of Heraclitus can be interpreted as follows: The world is in a constant state of flux, upon which we as humans have constructed a language that attempts to define and separate the world: the creation of identity. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.24">In reality the flux as a whole is in a single harmony. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.24">It is this unity and harmony that Heraclitus calls Logos and this is the true nature of the world. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.24">It is no wonder that we have difficulty pinpointing the meaning of the word Logos in such an instance, its meaning is undoubtedly vague and hard to grasp. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.24">
<s n="s1.5;p3.24">Our understanding of Heraclitus is in no way helped by his style of writing. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.24">Little survives of his work, and that which does is so enigmatic as to be possible of multiple interpretations. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.24">He uses many paradoxes, such as "The road up and down is the same road" and "Sea water is both the most pure and impure". </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.24">These may be to emphasise how our view of the world is completely relative, but may also be an attempt to show how our ideas on identity, and hence contradiction, may be flawed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.24">Perhaps we are unable to use the law of non-contradiction at all; in order to be sure that something is a contradiction, one must be absolutely clear on the nature of identity, something which Heraclitus believes we aren't; at least not when trapped in our own narrow point of view. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.7;p4.24">Alternatively, or additionally, the paradoxes may be the only way Heraclitus can express himself clearly in a fickle language. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.24">By working out the puzzle of his language we can also realise the true nature of the world. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.24">This insistence on the use of Paradoxes leads to criticism from Aristotle, who dismissed the arguments of Heraclitus because they broke the law of non-contradiction. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.24">Aristotle apparently couldn't, or refused to, understand that the Paradoxes are pointing to a deeper meaning. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.24">It is easy to get stuck pondering the meaning of Heraclitus' words and miss what the words are pointing to. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.24">As he said himself: "It is wise for those who listen not to me but to the principle to agree in principle that everything is one". </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.24">A final, less satisfying explanation for Heraclitus' unique writing style is expressed in a quote from Jean Paul: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"Generally speaking, it is quite right if great things - things of much sense for men of rare sense - are expressed but briefly and (hence) darkly, so that barren minds will declare it to be nonsense, rather than translate it into a nonsense that they can comprehend. For mean, vulgar minds have an ugly facility for seeing in the profoundest and most pregnant utterance only their own everyday opinion."</hi>

<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.2;p5.24">While it is unlikely that Heraclitus wrote as he did simply to confuse the ignorant, it may well be the case that he found it impossible to express his ideas in easy to understand language. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.24">Regardless of why Heraclitus writes in such a way, the fact remains that it is easy to misinterpret his meaning, and this can lead to many views that conflict with each other without directly conflicting with the text. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.3;p6.24">Heraclitus is clear from the very beginning that the vast majority of men view the world in a flawed way. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p7.24">Assuming that Heraclitus is talking about something more than simply physical sleep, this fragment explains his belief that the majority of people, although not necessarily all people, view the world from their own highly relativistic viewpoint. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p7.24">From this subjective view we see distinction between objects, and are able to identify things as "the same" or "different". </s>
<s n="s3.9;p7.24">The creation of language allows us to make sense of the world and strengthens our ideas of identity. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p7.24">However it is unclear whether our mental distinctions came about as a result of language or whether the introduction of language necessitated our already being able to distinguish between objects. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p7.24">Logical contradictions arose as a consequence of the creation of language, but are only viewed in such a way because of our superficial conception of identity caused by our narrow, relativistic viewpoint. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p7.24">As Heraclitus points out, God sees no contradiction, because ultimately there isn't one. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p7.24">In this case by "God" Heraclitus is referring to the Logos rather than any personal deity. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p7.24">In Greek thought there is no transcendent creator god; the cosmos and its laws come first, and even Zeus is bound to a certain world order and lives within it. </s>

<p n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.7;p9.24">One of the main points of Heraclitus' thinking is his idea of flux. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.24">By flux Heraclitus means constant change, something which he believes is happening to everything at all times. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.24">At first glance it is hard to see how the idea of constant change can be reconciled with his view of a constant, never-changing Logos. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.24">The solution lies in the relation between the two ideas of Logos and flux. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.24">The idea of flux, as we shall see, leads Heraclitus to believe that nothing can truly exist, at least not in the sense that we consider objects to exist. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.24">Without any concept of a distinction between objects, the idea of a single being within a unified Logos essentially becomes the only alternative. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.24">In his work "<hi rend="italic">Philosophy in the Tragic age of the Greeks"</hi> Nietzsche explains this in the following way: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">"From such intuition Heraclitus derived two connected negations. One, he denied the duality of totally diverse worlds.

<s n="s2.5;p11.24">But when viewed in the context of the idea of flux the meaning is more obvious. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.24">By "being" is simply meant the existence of specific identifiable objects, which the idea of flux has already ruled out: Our notion of identity is our own creation and not part of actual existence, where constant change makes identifiable objects an impossibility. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p13.24">This statement can be interpreted in at least two ways. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.24">The first view accepts that Heraclitus' views on flux confirm that the river will indeed be different the next time we step into it. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.24">But the idea of flux as expressed above would also suggest that not only has the river changed, but so has the person stepping into it. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p14.24">The second interpretation alters the meaning of Heraclitus' words. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p14.24">Instead of a "new river" it is likely that Heraclitus simply pointed out that "ever different waters are flowing". </s>
<s n="s3.8;p14.24">This view is perfectly coherent with the river as an entity staying the same. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p14.24">In fact, the fact that the waters are ever-changing is exactly what gives the river its existence as a river rather than a lake. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p14.24">In this case, it is as if Heraclitus is saying we both do and do not step into the same river. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p14.24">This statement is much more reminiscent of a Heraclitean paradox. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p14.24">The river has to be constantly changing in order to be a river, but it remains the same river. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p14.24">So the river doesn't just stay the same despite its flux, it retains its identity precisely because of the flux. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.24">
<s n="s1.12;p15.24">Heraclitus often talks about war as being the natural state of all things, which at first glance appears to contradict the idea of the harmony of Logos. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p15.24">But the word "war" is misleading, and would be better replaced with "tension". </s>
<s n="s3.12;p15.24">Heraclitus uses the example of a bow or lyre to show how apparently conflicting opposites can form a harmony. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p15.24">The tension is not damaging, but vital to a bow's function. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p15.24">In a broader sense, the continuous flux of the universe is a form of conflict. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p15.24">But like the bow, ultimately the flux creates a harmony that is Logos. </s>

<s n="s8.12;p15.24">The two sides of the contradiction appear to be in complete conflict, but ultimately they are united, even if only by the fact they are contained within a single sentence. </s>
