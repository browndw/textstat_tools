<s n="s1.2;p3.43">The aim of this project was to discover whether a possible atomic structure for melt-spun amorphous Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi> could be found using a model based on a random atomic packing, with a spherically symmetric potential, but including forcing the nickel atoms apart to the minimum distance found in the above experiment; or whether further modifications to this model would be needed to find a structure. </s>

<p n="p5.43">
<s n="s1.3;p5.43">Amorphous metals were the focus of considerable interest during the late 1970s and 1980s <hi rend="sup">4</hi>, because of their unusual physical properties: they are hard, ductile, not brittle and are relatively good electrical conductors <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>

<p n="p42.43">
<s n="s1.4;p42.43">The aim of this project was to discover whether the atomic structure of melt-spun amorphous Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi> could be modelled by a random atomic packing based on a spherically symmetric potential, with the nickel atoms forced apart to the distance found experimentally. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p42.43">This model was produced and studied, but it did not give a close enough match to the experimental data to represent a possible structure. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p42.43">The structure of the crystalline form of the material, and the radius ratio of the atoms, suggests that trigonal prisms may be present in amorphous Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p42.43">However, no particular structural configurations could be found in the model; it appeared to represent a random distribution of atoms. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.43">
<s n="s1.4;p43.43">This shows that using the correct radius ratio, a spherically symmetric potential and forcing the nickel atoms apart is not sufficient to find a structure for amorphous Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p43.43">It appears that any minor alterations to a spherically symmetric potential would not be sufficient to model the structure; the results and analysis of the model imply very strongly that a more sophisticated potential is needed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p43.43">Some directionality would need to be introduced into the potential to give a bias towards specific local environments. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.43">Using such a potential, it may be possible to produce a model of a possible structure, in which trigonal prisms, or some other structural units, may be found. </s>
