The protection of the common interest used to be the task of the nation-state. But the powers of the state have shrunk as global capital markets have expanded. (...). Since capital is essential to the creation of wealth, governments must cater to its demands, often to the detriment of other considerations. (...).

<s n="s1.6;p29.33">However, the good news is that we witnessed a post- Washington consensus: the World Bank has actually acknowledged that economic growth and poverty reduction has not been successful in the 1980s and 1990s while financial liberalisation (with weak regulation and volatility of capital flow) generated severe disturbance in economic performance. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p29.33">Consequently, the New World Development Report (2000 and 2001) has been surprisingly 'inconsistent' with the previous neo-liberal approach.<ref target="BAWE_0195c-ftnote.037"/> The 2001 Report has added the 'pillars' of opportunity, empowerment and security to the 2000 ones of labour-intensity, investment in human capital, and social safety nets. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p29.33">These new pillars demonstrate a broadening manner of understanding poverty and its causes. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p29.33">Selectivity, aid being directed to 'good', namely, democratic governments has replaced conditionality. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p29.33">Moreover, the focus on sector aid has its own shortcomings too since it may become just another name for project-aid, which has proved to be poor-oblivious, uncoordinated, fragmented, unsustainable and, given the donor's pursuit of commercial interests.<ref target="BAWE_0195c-ftnote.038"/> Consequently, the impact of these new changes is open to criticism especially because there seem to be no consensus within the World Bank on the path to be followed while the previous approaches still remain. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p29.33">"One aspect, then, of the Bank's retreat from liberalisation is a simple change in expository style: from aggressive advocacy of specific policies to a much more agnostic posture (...)".<ref target="BAWE_0195c-ftnote.039"/> Donors' commitment should be more than just rhetoric. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p31.33">As shown in the essay, globalisation as the dominant meta-narrative has also become the ideological framework in international assistance. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p31.33">The paper has focused, at a high level of generalisation, on the negative impact of economic globalisation on world poverty. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p31.33">Globalisation (i.e. the spread of market capitalism) accentuates poverty and social inequities instead of being the medicine to cure these problems. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p31.33">In line with the tenet of reform internationalism, the present paper denies the negative component of globalisation, namely, market fundamentalism. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p31.33">The market alone is neither efficient nor sufficient in poverty (and inequality) reduction. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p31.33">As John Gray rightly asserts "Economic globalisation does not strengthen the current regime of global laissez-faire. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p32.33">The paper has also argued that globalisation has a negative impact especially in developing countries since they do not have the prerequisite to access its benefits. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p32.33">How can one developing state let the markets do their job to improve economic performance when there is no market or possibility to participate in market transactions? </s>
<s n="s3.8;p32.33">Economic growth has not been successful in terms of poverty (and inequality) reduction since the neo-liberal 'recipe' has generally neglected the specific country situation. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p32.33">Consequently, economic globalisation has generated just another call for aid to support developing states in coping with global competitiveness. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p32.33">However, as shown in the paper, aid is generally perceived as ineffective in terms of poverty reduction. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p32.33">Aid programs have been designed in the same neo-liberal blueprint, neglecting the fragile conditions for markets and liberalisation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p32.33">Moreover, as in a vicious circle, aid economic conditionality, especially in the 1980s reiterated the neo-liberal requirement for liberalisation which may bring economic growth but do not reach the poor. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p32.33">Aid has been a complement rather than a supplement of globalisation, ineffective in correcting its deficiencies. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p33.33">Nevertheless, the fact that globalisation has also losers does not mean that it should be resisted. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p33.33">Foreign aid's contribution to poverty reduction in these regions is in fact perpetuating globalisation's harmful impact. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p33.33">They both operate with the same standard neo-liberal methods relying solely on the power of free markets. </s>
