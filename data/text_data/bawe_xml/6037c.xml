<s n="s2.5;p24.37">The high numbers of colony forming units per gram of mince may have been due to the mince being stored for 3 days before testing and maybe the storage of the mince, i.e. in the fridge. </s>

</p>
<p n="p25.37">
<s n="s1.4;p25.37">The pour plate PCA method had an 8.3% confidence limit of the colony count. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.37">This method was simple but only the highest dilution could be examined and counted because on the lower dilutions there were too many colonies to count. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.37">However when results of the class were taken into consideration, the 95% confidence limit as a % of the count was reduced to 2.4%. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.37">This meant the width of the confidence interval was reduced, which created a more accurate result. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.37">
<s n="s1.3;p26.37">The spread plate method showed a small increase in the colony forming units compared with the PCA pour plate but they were still of the same factor of 10 <hi rend="sup">8</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.37">This method was very quick, however a sample size of only 0.1 ml was used. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p27.37">The pour plate method for Enterobacteriaceae showed pink/purple colonies with haloes of precipitate bile salts. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.37">However these were present in lower number than expected, especially my result of 3.95×10 <hi rend="sup">4</hi> mean count per gram. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.37">The low count was due to the clumps of cells not being broken up and the microorganism may not have been well dispersed. </s>
