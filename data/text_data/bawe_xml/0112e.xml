<s n="s1.3;p3.12">The mouse makes a good genetic model because it is possible to create genetic knock-outs, removing the function of a gene by both forward and reverse genetics. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.12">Like with the chick the entire genomic sequence is known and the organism is easy to maintain and reproduced quickly. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.12">The disadvantage of using mice is that it is impossible to observe a developing embryo since it is buried deep within the mother's uterus, making it difficult to manipulate the mouse physically by tissue manipulation or the implantation of coated beads. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.12">The vertebrate limb consists of an asymmetrical distribution of parts, falling along three main axes all controlled by there own signalling centre. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p5.12">Three elements of the limb exist along the PD axis, the most proximal element is the stylopod followed by the zeugopod and finally the most distal element the autopod (figure 1). </s>

<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.3;p6.12">Within the chick the first sign of limb formation is the thickening of the lateral plate mesoderm which eventually develops into limb buds that extend outwards producing differentiated cells that form the limb. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.12">This region of thickening is called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER); behind the ridge is the progression zone containing undifferentiated cells that will form the skeletal elements (figure 2). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.12">Posterior and proximal to the progression zone is the zone of polarising activity (ZPA) which is the primary source of signalling molecules that form the patterns along the AP axis (Niswander <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1993). </s>

<head rend="underlined">Formation of the Limb Buds</head>
<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.4;p7.12">Components of an FGF signalling cascade initiate the limb bud formation in vertebrates and cause the formation of the AER. FGF10 is the first FGF to be detected and is found in the mesenchyme of the limb forming region where it induces the production of FGF8 in the overlying ectoderm (Tickle and Munsterberg 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.12">These two FGF's function to in a regulatory loop which induces the formation of and helps to maintains the AER. In the chick it has been shown that FGF10 is initially expressed across the segmental plate (SP), intermediate mesoderm (IM) and the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), but soon becomes restricted to the LPM. This restriction is partly due to the expression of other FGF factors such as FGF8, FGF4 and FGF2 which are produced in the somites and IM (Kawakami <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.12">The restricted FGF10 protein signals to the surface ectoderm causing it to express FGF8, these ectoderm cells will form the AER and signal back to the IM via FGF8 to maintain the expression of FGF10, therefore completing the regulatory loop (Kawakami <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2001). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.12">In FGF10 deficient mice embryos the limb bud does form but no out growth takes place, analysis by Sekine <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1999) showed that neither the AER or the ZPA formed in these mice and no FGF8 expression was detected in the ectoderm, leading to the conclusion that FGF10 induces FGF8. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.3;p8.12">The FGF loop is regulated by 3 molecular mediators in the form of <hi rend="italic">Wnt</hi> genes that act through Î²-catenin pathways. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.12">FGF10 restriction is not only created via other FGF's but also by two WNT proteins expressed in the intermediate mesoderm (Takeuchi <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003), WNT2B (in the forelimb only) and WNT8C (in the hindlimbs). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.12">The action of these <hi rend="italic">Wnt</hi> genes is essential for the maintenance of FGF10 in the limb buds (figure 3). </s>

In the hindlimb <hi rend="italic">Wnt8c</hi> is being expressed (not shown on diagram) where it induces <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi> . FGF10 in both locations signals to the surface ectoderm inducing <hi rend="italic">Wnt3a</hi> causing the expression of <hi rend="italic">Fgf8</hi> genes.

</figure>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.1;p9.12">Wnt2b was added exogenously to flank LPM by Kawakami <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2001 where it causes the formation of an ectopic limb, supporting the idea that it is required for the induction of <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi>. </s>

<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.6;p10.12">The initiation and regulation of expression of <hi rend="italic">Wnt2b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wnt8c</hi> is mediated by the presence transcription factors from the T-box family, Tbx4 and Tbx5. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.12">Tbx4 is found only in the hindlimb bud where as Tbx5 is found expressed in the forelimb (figure 4). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.12">Tbx5 was first detected in prospective forelimb mesenchyme (Rallis <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003) before any limb outgrowth had begun, it is even expressed in <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi> knockout mice, showing that it is genetically upstream of <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi> expression. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.12">When Tbx5 is places onto the developing hindlimb it causes the production of wing like digits, when Tbx4 transcripts are placed on to the wing it causes the production of toe like digits and showing that these factors must play some role in limb specification (Rodrigues-Esteban <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1999). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.12">Rallis <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (2003) created conditional knock-out mice where <hi rend="italic">Tbx5</hi> was not expressed in limb mesenchyme; the embryos they created showed a complete absence off all elements of the appendicular skeleton with disrupted shoulder and pelvis structure. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.12">A similar phenotype was observed in <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi> knock-out mice but not as severe indicating that Tbx5 has a broader influence on forelimb development and is upstream of <hi rend="italic">Fgf10</hi>. </s>

A first wave of lateral morphogenetic movements results in the compaction of the AER precursor cells onto the ventral surface of the early limb bud and early ventral ectodermal thickening. A second wave compresses this domain to the distal 1/3 of the ventral limb, and a final wave constricts the cells into the densely packed AER.
