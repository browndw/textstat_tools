<s n="s6.8;p2.27">There is no distortion in all markets such as government interventions. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.27">While marginal rate of substitution is independent on scale of consumption, the model expands to allow for trade by assuming that people in both countries demand both goods and tastes preferences are same in both countries. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.27">Most importantly, the relative endowments of factors of production of both countries are different. </s>
