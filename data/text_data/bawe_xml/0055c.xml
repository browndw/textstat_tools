<s n="s2.7;p1.21">Unemployment is an economic market failure that has been claimed to be effected by many different factors. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.21">Some of them include, greater monopoly power among firms, high labor taxes, union structure (labor unions, union membership, labor union coverage), high levels of unemployment benefits and its duration (how many months can an unemployed claim benefits),a large proportion of long-term unemployed, substantial regional variations in unemployment, labor mobility, demand shocks (i.e. real interest rate), employment protection laws, active labor market policies, and coordinated wage bargaining. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.21">European Unemployment since 1980 has been relatively high compared to other countries. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.21">In the 1980's European unemployment has increased, however today the main reason why average European unemployment is too high is because the unemployment rates of the 'Big Four', France, Italy, Germany and Spain, are too high. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.21">Most other European countries have been able to recover from the 1980's unemployment crises but mainly the 'Big Four' has failed to do so. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.21">Following arguments will explain some of the reasons why the 'Big Four' was not able to recover from 1980's unemployment disaster. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.21">
<s n="s1.4;p2.21">An increase in unemployment might have been caused by greater monopoly power between firms and workers. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.21">Greater monopoly power of employers, firms, will tend to increase prices, decrease output and set a lower employment with low wages. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.21">When unions have little power and there is high level of unemployment, the unions accept low real wages at any real wage rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.21">Therefore, less competitive product markets lead to higher unemployment (See Figure 1.1)<ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.001"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p3.21">The overall wage depends on the strength of the trade unions; wage bargains, union coverage and the degree of co-ordination of wage bargains. </s>

<p n="p4.21">
<s n="s1.2;p4.21">There are strong unions because of several different reasons. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.21">One reason is because of the number of membership and strong union rights that pressure the institutions, industries and firms that put high real wages. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.21">
<s n="s1.7;p5.21">The government also effects the monopoly of labor unions with the laws and benefits they provide to the unemployed. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.21">The unemployment benefit is a very important factor which effects unemployment. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.21">When the unemployment benefits are high, their coverage are high and due long periods of times, which decreases the opportunity cost of not having a job. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.21">In other words, there is a lower possibility of an unemployed to fill vacancies in a market. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.21">The unemployed will look for a suitable job for himself until he finds one whereas if the unemployment benefits weren't so high, the unemployed would be willing to accept any job at any real wage rate. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.21">This might be one of the reasons why although the level of vacancy in Europe in the 1990's was high and yet the unemployment doubled in the last two decades (See Table 1.1)<ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.21">Whereas usually when there are high numbers of vacancies one would expect unemployment to be decreasing like it happened in Denmark, Netherlands and the UK. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p9.21">Lower competition within the unemployed will in effect create a market monopoly for the employers, where the employers will gain a monopoly power in the market, and put an upward pressure to unemployment. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p11.21">This is bad for the unemployment rate in their economy because it shows that the unemployed workers are less willing to change their habitat for better job opportunities. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.21">Therefore, this also means that there will be less competition between workers to fill a vacancy, which as mentioned above, creates more unemployment. </s>

<p n="p12.21">
<s n="s1.6;p12.21">Taxes also have a big influence on the level of unemployment. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.21">Mainly, three tax rates influence the gap between the producer and consumer real wage: payroll taxes(taxes that either the employer or employee pay and that are normally related to social security contributions), income taxes and consumer price taxes <ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.004"/> In Figure 1.2 These tax wedges (the gap between what the sellers receive for supplying goods and services and the prices buyers buy) shifts the wage setting curve further to the right and thus increase the natural rate of unemployment. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.21">The reason why the wage setting curve shifts right is because the higher the taxes are, the greater the unions seek to provide a given real standard of living for their members and increase real wages. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.21">Tax wedges are also sought as a reason to understand some of the reasons for higher unemployment during the 1960-1985 period.<ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.005"/> All countries, including the Big Four portray an increase in tax wedge, during the 1960's to 1990's. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.21">In contrast with the Big Four, countries such as Netherlands and UK has shown significant attempts to reduce labor taxes in recent years. </s>
