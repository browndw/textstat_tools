<p n="p1.82">
<s n="s1.1;p1.82">A 20% stake in the business, SCS Ltd, if being offered in return for a £70,000 investment to allow us to enter the market with our developed system called LiquiSaver. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.82">
<s n="s1.1;p2.82">LiquiSaver is designed to be installed into drinking establishments, and has the ability to stringently measure the volume of free-flow products (lager, cider etc) that have been dispensed by each member of staff. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.82">
<s n="s1.1;p3.82">In many establishments, beer is the biggest selling product but does not provide a high level of profit, thus it is important for a manager to be able to account for all the beer that have been dispensed - this requires stringent methods of measuring stock. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.82">
<s n="s1.1;p4.82">The LiquiSaver provides this method &amp; also records who has dispensed each beverage, allowing for easy detection of bar staff pilfering. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.82">
<s n="s1.2;p5.82">SCS Ltd has a very strong team of four directors from engineering backgrouds, each of whom currently own a 25% stake in the business. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.82">They bring experience from a wide range of areas - <name type="student name"/> manages the company, and brings experience from pub trade management, <name type="student name"/> is the chief engineer of the project, <name type="student name"/> &amp; <name type="student name"/> deal with the financial sector of the business, having worked within several accounting companies. <name type="student name"/> has strong international business relations because of his experiences and interactions with overseas companies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.82">
<s n="s1.2;p6.82">We have identified a niche in the UK dispense monitoring market for a system that not only measures that drinks dispensed, but moreover, recognises each member of staff. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.82">We have recognised that a system would be of great benefit to establishments with many members of staff &amp; are thus focusing our marketing towards students' union bars. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.82">
<s n="s1.2;p7.82">As present, we are operating the business from home &amp; carry out all of the field work ourselves (consultations, installations &amp; aftersale service) as we do not require the facilities of dedicated premises nor extra members of staff. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.82">Once the buiness begins to grow &amp; demand for the product increases, we shall relocate the business &amp; employ members of staff to help with the everyday operations </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.82">
<s n="s1.2;p8.82">Because of the highly differentitated nature of the system that we have developed, we predict excellent returns on your investment, with an expectance to break even after the sale of 17 units - which roughly equates to 3 complete student unions installations. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.82">We furthermore predict that a profit of £100,000 will be reached after the sale of 90 units. </s>

<p n="p9.82">
<s n="s1.3;p9.82">SCS Limited is a small company that was set up in June 2006. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.82">The four directors; <name type="student name"/>, <name type="student name"/>, <name type="student name"/> &amp; <name type="student name"/>, currently own 100% of the company (25% each), however, we are offering 20% of the firm's shares in return for a £70,000 investment in the company. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.82">The remaining 80% of the firm's equity would be divided equally between the four current directors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.82">
<s n="s1.3;p10.82">The 'LiquiSaver' system, the current project that SCS Ltd has been developing since it began, is a stock control system for free-flow products. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.82">We have come up with a feasible design for our product and have applied for the patent for the current design. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.82">We have contacted foreign contractors for the production of our device and they have agreed to proceed with our design after the feasibility study. </s>

<head rend="underlined italic">Section 3 - Products/Services</head>
<p n="p11.82">
<s n="s1.3;p11.82">The "LiquiSaver" system has been developed with the needs of the customer in mind. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.82">We noticed a gap in the UK dispense monitoring market for product that not only measures the volume of beverages dispensed, but furthermore recognises by whom they have been dispensed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.82">The system consists of three main parts: flow meters, the processing hardware that provides the manager with a printout of the day's activity and an I.D. checking systems. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.82">
<s n="s1.3;p12.82">The flow meters are a cruicial component of the sytem &amp; are designed to be connected in line of the keg and font in order to measure the volume of beverage that has been dispensed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.82">The I.D. checking system restricts flow through the fonts unless the bartender signifys, by means of either a swipe card or an electromatic plastic ring that is worn on a finger, that he requires use of the font - this derestricts the beer's flow allowing the drink to be dispensed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.82">The CPU registers how much and by whom the beverage was sold. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0356c-pic.001">
<head>Fig 3.1 - Schematic of the System</head>
</figure>
<p n="p13.82">
<s n="s1.2;p13.82">LiquiSaver was developed for establishments that have a great number of staff, making it difficult to track pilfering without registering by whom the beer was sold. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.82">The main niche that we developed the product for is campus based students' unions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.82">
<s n="s1.2;p14.82">Before we develop a new product and see the need for better services we first need the existing product to mature positively in this market where unexpected problems could arise quickly. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.82">Once the product has reached stable sales, profit targets and generated additional cash for a new investment opportunity then additional parts and new parts will be produced and tested. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.82">
<s n="s1.1;p15.82">The new product range we have in mind is an optic dispensed spirit control, line cleaning &amp; temperature checks for the system. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Unique selling proposition:</head>
<p n="p16.82">
<s n="s1.3;p16.82">The product is highly differentiated in that it has been developed specifically as a way to prevent pilfering &amp; thus is worth an establishment paying a high fee for because of its ability to prevent the loss of income. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.82">We shall, in future, train staff for maintaining the system, as &amp; when problems arise. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.82">Very special to the maintaining staff is that we train them to train our customers at the first day of installation of how everything works. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.82">Fig 3.1 shows the life cycle curve for the product. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.82">We are aiming for our product not to decline after it has reached its mature point. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.82">Therefore as mentioned before we update our existing products and add new ones depending on the consumers' need. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Current technology:</head>
<p n="p18.82">
<s n="s1.2;p18.82">The current technology of measuring the beer flow to avoid pilferage already exists from competing companys, Brulines Ltd. and Nucleus Data Ltd. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.82">These products are developed for pub chains, as opposed to the type of venue that we are marketing to, &amp; we will furthermore compete on quality, technology and more user friendly service. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Future development:</head>
<p n="p19.82">
<s n="s1.1;p19.82">As we think further we understand that we do not see such a large competitor as a disadvantage and more likely as an advantage since it can be learnt from the products they produce. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.82">
<s n="s1.3;p20.82">This means that we analyse their and similar products in the markets in order to reverse engineer. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.82">Thus this gives us a broader idea of products in order to create a more updated, technologically advanced product and simple to understand design so that the consumer can cope with it easily. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.82">More importantly we reuse the older equipment from our customers as part of our deal which would reduce the final price of the new updated products and quality will still remain the same. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p21.82">Desk research through Mintel databases suggests such free flow beverages account for some 46% of all beverages sold by both on &amp; off trade establishments (as shown in fig 4.1.1), and as fig 4.1.2 shows, the demand for these drinks in increasing. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p22.82">According to a Mintel report <hi rend="sup">1</hi>, in 2005 the UK Drinks market from on-licensed premises was worth £24.16 billion. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.82">SCS Ltd is positioned in a supply chain by supplying a solution directly to drinking establishments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.82">
<s n="s1.2;p23.82">As we are marketing our product direct to another business, we must orientate ourselves to the business buying system, and more specifically, the system of new task purchase, as opposed to re-buys. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.82">Once the idea has been pitched to the establishments, the business buyer will consider alternatives, which is why it is important for our product to be pitched as higher quality than the competition, so the buyer justifies spending the extra money. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p24.82">As described in section 3, LiquiSaver has been developed to detect not only what drinks have been sold but who they were sold by. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p26.82">Although the niche in which we are planning to promote our product is a very small one, we hope that the differentiated nature of our product to suit this niche will allow us to benefit from high profit margins. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p29.82">High staff turnover as students tend to work as and when they need money. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.82">It is less likely for managers to develop bonds with their staff, from which trust develops. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p30.82">
<s n="s1.1;p30.82">Friends of staff drink at unions regularly, which is the main cause for staff dispensing drinks without charging for them. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p31.82">
<s n="s1.2;p31.82">Drinks tend to be much cheaper in student union bars than in regular clubs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.82">This leads to lower profit margins, and a greater need to maximise income from drinks sold. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p32.82">
<s n="s1.1;p32.82">The large quantity of drinks sold in a student union bar leads to bar staff pilfering being very difficult to detect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.82">
<s n="s1.2;p33.82">These factors increase the susceptibility of losing income through pilfering, which is the ultimate reason for choosing this niche. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p33.82">The SCS system is specifically to be aimed at unions of campus based universities, as the social life is much more heavily focused around the student union - students attending city based universities have a much greater choice of pubs/bars/clubs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.82">
<s n="s1.2;p34.82">We currently have a prototype of the SCS System installed into the University of <name type="university"/>'s student union. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p34.82">Union managers &amp; indeed staff are becoming accustomed to the system &amp; negotiations are currently underway to carry out a full installation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.82">
<s n="s1.3;p35.82">Involving ourselves with <name type="university"/>'s student union will allow us to negotiate deals with the Aldwych group. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p35.82">The president of <name type="university"/>'s student union, Brian Duggan is also the chair of the Aldwych group, so as SCS Ltd becomes more involved &amp; develops a reputation within <name type="university"/>'s union, the ability to promote ourselves through the Aldwych group may arise. </s>

<p n="p37.82">
<s n="s1.2;p37.82">There are only two UK companies who produce a similar product to ours. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.82">These companies are Brulines Ltd and Nucleus Data Ltd, who both offer a system that provides pub chains with information for volumes of each beverage dispensed at their tenant run establishments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.82">
<s n="s1.3;p38.82">According to the FAME database, Brulines Ltd is a Very Large company; in 2006 they turned over £2.71 million, at a profit margin of 22.53% and a return on capital employed of 68.75%. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.82">This suggests that the company has the monopoly of this industry &amp; are operating in a very efficient fashion. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.82">Nucleus Data Ltd is a much smaller company and the financial data available is thus very limited. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.82">
<s n="s1.1;p39.82">According to their website <hi rend="sup">3</hi>, in May 2006 Brulines Ltd attempted to float on the stock market twice, however, after recommendations from shareholders due to volatile market conditions, decided to withdraw this intention in June 2006. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.82">
<s n="s1.1;p40.82">Brulines Ltd supply their system to many of the large UK pub chains - Punch Taverns, Greene Kings, Enterprise Inns etc, who install "the EDISbox" into their establishments. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p41.82">Brulines' system, however, is intended to be used in tenant run establishments as a way to prevent tenants from taking a greater share of the pub's profit than they are entitled to. </s>

<p n="p42.82">
<s n="s1.2;p42.82">Brulines Ltd market their product to small public houses, having installed the system into 14,000 premises owned by only 20 pub chains. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p42.82">They have thus developed a strong hold on this market, which excludes our niche and thus operations shall not be affected by our position in the market, meaning that their response to our entry may be none. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.82">
<s n="s1.2;p43.82">Because we have chosen to market our product in such a small niche, Brulines Ltd will not act in a sense that we are in direct competition with them. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p43.82">Penetration of the chosen niche will allow us entry to the market, allowing us in future to branch out to market our product to other segments of the market, such as privately ran nightclubs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.82">
<s n="s1.1;p44.82">The highly differentiated nature of our product which is aimed at a specific niche of the market means that once we have penetrated the market, and continue to grow as a company whilst reducing production costs, we will set in place a barrier to entry for any potential competitors. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p58.82">The reason is because we already used a prototype and tested it at a student union at the University of <name type="university"/> where minor problems occurred. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p60.82">The sources we are going to use to identify the right supplier down to our needs are recommendations, directories, trade associations, business advisers and exhibitions. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p62.82">It has to be said that more than one supplier is needed. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p62.82">The reason is because our supplier might be in financial debt or another problem might have occurred during production or transportation and also we might not have the opportunity to pay in cheque beforehand. </s>

<p n="p63.82">

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p71.82">
<s n="s1.2;p71.82">An insufficient amount of time may have been predicted for start-up processes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p71.82">This risk may be reduced by utilising the seasonality of the company's activity - the quiet periods during university term time can be employed to orientate &amp; prepare the business for periods of high level of activity. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p72.82">
<s n="s1.2;p72.82">Inaccuracies in financial forecasts, which could lead to cash flow problems. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p72.82">By pitching our sales price high, underestimations in financial forecasts will be absorbed by this high margin. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p73.82">
<s n="s1.2;p73.82">Offering discounts because of the temptation of revenue. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p73.82">This risk must be minimised by staying focused as a business, to maintain a high level of maturity - strong profit margins &amp; a healthy cash flow are more beneficial to the company than volume of sales. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p74.82">
<s n="s1.2;p74.82">Pressure on the management to have to cope with every aspect of the business, which could lead to a loss of focus on the original plan. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p74.82">The diverse range of experience (including production processes, leadership ability &amp; experience in running drinking establishments) that the management bring to the company mean that we know &amp; can familiarise ourselves with the business market that we are entering, which will allow us to remain focused &amp; manage ourselves through the situations that we are likely to encounter. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p75.82">
<s n="s1.1;p75.82">Promotional strategy may not be as effective as originally hoped, although the risk is reduced as we shall be mostly pitching the product directly to the businesses &amp; the promotional strategy is not crucial. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p76.82">
<s n="s1.2;p76.82">Time to establish relationships with suppliers may be greater than initially anticipated &amp; may furthermore cause an issue where credit for the business is concerned. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p77.82">Receiving money from customers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p77.82">Being a new business, our bargaining position is not yet strong, however, this risk is reduced by the fact that we are targeting a niche of students' unions who have established themselves over a length of time as professional organisations, as opposed to pitching our product to rough &amp; disreputable venues. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p78.82">
<s n="s1.4;p78.82">Time, cost &amp; availability may cause problems when it comes to finding premises. </s>
