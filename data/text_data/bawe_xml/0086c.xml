<head rend="underlined bold">CONCLUSION:</head>
<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.8;p10.12">Having looked at few important areas under tort law one would think that the law deals with a number of issues. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p10.12">If a case does not fall under any other civil law, it falls under tort. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p10.12">But we can see that not only does tort law deal with cases which other branches of law do not deal with but also ones that fall under categories of law, like contract law (economic loss - contractual breach). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p10.12">Again, the aim of tort law is not to punish people, but to compensate the party and restore status quo. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.12">The award of punitive damages falls under criminal law. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p10.12">These only increase the number of cases. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p10.12">But exemplary damages are only awarded rarely. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.12">Usually regular or special damages are awarded. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.12">
<s n="s1.2;p11.12">Tort law has been there for centuries and there cannot be a sudden change, the judges cannot say that they would only deal with particular areas and reject the rest; it is expected of them to address the claims of the injured party. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.12">Yet it would be desirable if tort law limited its scope to promote efficiency. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.12">
<s n="s1.8;p12.12">Yet another important problem under tort law is it lacks coherence. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.12">When we look at the cases above we can notice that there are conflicting decisions. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.12">Judges mostly decide cases on policy arguments than relying upon precedents. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.12">This leads to incoherence in the law. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.12">But this has been the problem prevailing since times immemorial. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.12">But it would be welcome to see tort law being more coherent, if the judges follow the 'rule of precedents', there would automatically be more coherence. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.12">And also if the law concentrates on its primary aim of compensating for the injuries suffered and tries not to extend the law, then tort law would be more certain. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p12.12">Extending the law would only increase the cases before it and would make the law inefficient and incoherent which is not desirable. </s>
