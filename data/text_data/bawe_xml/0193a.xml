<s n="s2.5;p8.42">Within the 'Agora' industry the company is placed fourth in terms of share price and has the lowest market share in both the Sonite and Vodite markets with 14.1% and 11% respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.42">Appendix one and two shows Team U against the other firms in the industry in terms of market share. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.42">In the Sonite market there is no dominant firm, but E currently leads the market with over 25% market share. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.42">The Vodite market is quite different in that Firm E's product is completely dominant with nearly 80% of the market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.42">
<s n="s1.1;p9.42">With growth in the predicted to be 30.7% in the Sonite market and 194.5% in the Vodite market over the next 5 periods it is clear that a sustainable brand is needed particularly in the latter market. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p11.42">SUCK is currently in the growth stage whereby sales are increasing but the emergence of competitors is evident. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.42">The product is primarily targeted at the singles market where its main competitors in terms of purchase intentions are SOFT and SIBI. Having failed to capitalise on the introductory stage by running out of products in the first period after it was introduced, it is of vital importance to invest in marketing. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.42">This is necessary in order to sustain growth in both retail sales and market share as brand awareness in the singles segment is only 27.1% compared with 59.6% for SIBI. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.42">
<s n="s1.3;p12.42">The SULI product, whilst losing market share has still managed to maintain strong retail sales of between 140,000 and 160,000 units each period and is currently propping up the company. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.42">"A consistent and sustainable cash flow stream from product sales is key to any long-term investment, and the best way to attain a stable revenue stream is a 'cash cow' product, leading products that command a large market share in mature markets." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0193a-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.3;p12.42">From this it can be determined that SULI is in the maturity stage which must be maintained for as long as possible in order to give the firm time to build up market share from its other products. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p13.42">Stock ran out upon its launch into the Vodite market and the emergence of two more focused brands in the following period meant the product's growth and maturity stages were both short lived. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.42">Appendix Three shows the difference in advertising expenditure between VUCK and the dominant brand in the market - VEBA. When VUCK was launched 1,000,000 was spent followed by 2,500,000 in its second period. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.42">This is in contrast to Team E who spent 6,000,000 in the launch period and as such established complete dominance. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.42">VUCK is some way off the ideal characteristics for the Followers segment. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p18.42">Whilst it is currently in the position of a dog implying it doesn't generate significant cash flow, it is on the fringe of becoming a cash cow. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.42">The company results show a consistent overall contribution after marketing of between 23 and 27 million which meets the description of a 'cash cow' in that "a product in this category generates large amounts of cash over and above that required to keep the product in this sector." </s>

<s n="s2.4;p31.42">If VUCK maintains its market share and the market grows as predicted, approximately 86,000 units will be sold. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.42">This means that production should be increased to approximately 50,000 to allow the units in inventory to be sold off and try to limit inventory held in future periods, particularly since it is held at a cost of 8%. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.42">When PVUUU is available in period 9 the brand will be modified but we will increase production in line with the growth of the market in an effort to capitalize on its re-launch as suggested above. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p33.42">When PVUUU is 're-launched' in period 9 there should be a large slice of the advertising budget spent. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p33.42">This will further increase the consumer's awareness of the brand and after a few periods of it being bought, purchase intentions will increase as will market share. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p33.42">This can be reduced in subsequent periods. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p33.42">An increase in advertising expenditure on SUCK from the current 1,000,000 figure should help facilitate this. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p34.42">As a result a strategy of targeted sales-force placement must be employed to bolster sales. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p34.42">SULI is aimed primarily at High Earners and Professionals with HE's highlighted as the most suitable audience for the product. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p34.42">From market research it is evident that HE's do 50% of their shopping in Department stores and 36.9% of total Sonite sales take place here. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p34.42">It is therefore prudent to increase sales-force in this area from 25 to 50 and increase their effort allocation further towards SULI from 50% to 60% with a 5% reduction on SUCK and VUCK . </s>
<s n="s5.6;p34.42">Historically SULI has sold around 40% of its units in Speciality stores where the firm currently has the majority of its sales-force. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p34.42">Given the cost of hiring and the relatively small growth in the market it is probably prudent to leave the number of sales people selling SULI in specialist stores unchanged. </s>

<p n="p35.42">
<s n="s1.3;p35.42">In the longer term it will also be expected that with the modifications made to VUCK the number of retail sales will increase. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p35.42">To accommodate this we will need to again increase sales-force in period 10. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p35.42">Since the new VUCK product is to be aimed solely at Followers who do 41.8% of their shopping in Mass Merchandising stores it will be prudent to add approximately 15 extra staff here and change their effort allocation to 75% VUCK. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p36.42">In the latter periods the firm kept expenditure below total budget in order to improve ROCE but this was achieved at a price, with retail sales and market shares both falling. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p36.42">This ultimately led to a fall in stock price. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p37.42">At the launch of a product advertising has to be as prevalent as the budget will allow. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p37.42">In addition to this, production levels should be high to accommodate the initial demand for the product. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p37.42">This mistake was made in the launch of both SUCK and VUCK but was particularly a detrimental in the launch of VUCK into the Vodite market where it was the only brand available for the initial period. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.42">Given inventory holding costs are only 8% it is therefore sensible to over produce in the initial period and then adjust production levels when more is known about demand. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.42">
<s n="s1.2;p38.42">Using the tools available it is better to base products on predicted future ideal characteristics so the brand will be attractive once its position in the market is better cemented. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p38.42">Since it takes a number of periods from research into a product to its launch, it is better to target customers' future satisfaction as we have done with PVUUU. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p39.42">It is not always better to be the first brand to a new market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p39.42">Whilst short term gains are possible, in the long run, the experience gained by competitors from the initial entrants will often enable them to establish a dominant position as the market grows. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p39.42">Profits generated from the introduction of VUCK were good after its launch, but since VEBA entered the market, retail sales have failed to grow in line with the growth of the industry and a sustained market share has been unattainable. </s>

<p n="p40.42">
<s n="s1.4;p40.42">Make sure that the cost of R &amp; D can be comfortably recouped by performing break-even analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p40.42">It cost 7,630,000 to bring VUCK to the market and it has yet to recoup its costs. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p40.42">It is also going to cost an additional 2,990,000 to make the modifications currently in development as the project PVUUU because there is more information about the market. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p40.42">Given the growth of the market it is expected to recoup its costs in only a few periods. </s>

<p n="p41.42">
<s n="s1.4;p41.42">Use the tools available. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p41.42">Given forecasts for market growth and the market research into current and projected market shares it is possible to predict demand quantities and as such suitable production levels. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p41.42">It is therefore un-necessary to over/under produce in any period apart from in the period of introduction. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p41.42">This is especially true given the 20,000 units under or over produced at the discretion of the production staff. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.42">
<s n="s1.3;p42.42">Know the market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.42">The analysis tools are useful in terms of finding out what competitors are doing, but the market research studies are the best indications of what customers want, where they go to get it, and how much they will pay for it. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p42.42">This is the perhaps the best tool for determining advertising expenditure, sales-force numbers and effort allocations and distribution channels. </s>
