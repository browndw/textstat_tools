<s n="s4.6;p1.13">The enzyme activities of the native and immoblilsed enzyme are measured and compared; their specific activities are 259mg <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>/15min assay and 49.7 mg <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>/15min assay respectively. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.13">The amount of substrate was found when immobilized enzymes were incubated with substrate over a period of time to observe the change in the rate of reaction. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.13">The amount of enzyme leaked out into the surroundings was also found by submerging immobilised enzymes in buffer and incubating the buffer alone with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p2.13">Enzymes are also known as biological catalysts. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.13">They speed up reactions and are reusable. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.13">Their specificity for substrate makes them very useful in food industry and laboratory work. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.13">Most enzymes come in solution form; therefore it is not possible to reuse them without complex extracting procedures. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.13">By immobilising enzymes, trapping them to a solid, enzymes are reusable and are more resistant to denaturation (both by extreme pHs or temperature). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.13">This is more economical when applied to industry. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.13">Since it is bound to a solid support, it is more difficult to alter its shape. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.13">Alginate consists of a long sugar chain with carboxyl groups projecting out. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.13">Calcium ions cross link the carboxyl groups to solidify alginate. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.13">Apart from trapping enzymes in alginate beads, other materials such as gelatine, polyacrylamide, carragenan and alginate can be used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.4;p3.13">Alkaline phosphatase was used in this experiment, it converts colourless p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) into phosphate and p-nitrophenol (pNP which is yellow at high pHs). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.13">The yellow colour allows the extent of the reaction to be measured by a spectrophotometer at 420nm. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.13">The reaction is done in 15mins assays; it is stopped by adding 1M sodium hydroxide to denature the enzyme. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.13">At extreme pHs, the hydrogen bonds within the enzyme break and denatures the enzyme. </s>

<s n="s3.16;p4.13">When determining the enzyme activity of the immobilised enzyme, water was added instead of enzymes in the control. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p4.13">The reusability of beads was determined by repeating 15mins assays. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p4.13">The liquid from the previous assay was removed using a pipette and the absorbance was measured. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p4.13">The beads were washed using 3ml washing buffer. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p4.13">The washing buffer was then removed and fresh assay buffer was added. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p4.13">The tube was placed in a 30Â° water bath for 5 mins and then substrate was added. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p4.13">After 15mins, 1ml 1M sodium hydroxide was added to stop the reaction. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p4.13">The absorbance at 420nm was measured and recorded. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p4.13">This was repeated for six times. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p4.13">The assay of total protein was not carried out due to the poor results produced in previous years. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p4.13">The amount of enzyme leaked out was investigated by incubating 4 beads in 2.7ml of assay buffer for an hour. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p4.13">The bathing liquid was removed and was incubated with 0.3ml of pNPP for 15mins. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p4.13">The reaction was stopped by adding 1ml 1M sodium hydroxide. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p6.13">The absorbance decreases as the number of assays increases. </s>

<p n="p7.13">
<s n="s1.2;p7.13">The positive A <hi rend="sub">420</hi> of the bathing liquid of the 4 beads shows that enzymes have leaked out of the beads. </s>

<p n="p8.13">
<s n="s1.4;p8.13">The specific activity is higher for native enzymes than in immobilised enzymes. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.13">Substrate has to diffuse into the alginate beads to react with the enzyme, the products then have to diffuse out into the liquid to be detected by a spectrophotometer. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.13">Time is needed for the diffusion of substrate and product therefore the rate is lower. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.13">Some products may be trapped in the enzyme beads when the bathing liquid is removed; therefore it gives a lower A <hi rend="sub">420</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.13">
<s n="s1.4;p9.13">The specific activity decreases as the number of assays increases because some of the enzymes leak out of the beads. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.13">Therefore fewer enzymes are present for the next assay. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.13">However, the amount of enzymes inside and outside of the bead maintains a dynamic equilibrium; therefore there will always be some enzymes in the beads. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.13">This also explains the leveling off of the graph. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.13">
<s n="s1.2;p10.13">The beads are easier to break just after they have formed because only the outer coating is solid. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.13">It takes time for the calcium ions to diffuse towards the centre of the beads and form cross links between alginate molecules. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.13">
<s n="s1.2;p11.13">EDTA breaks the gel structure. pH of the EDTA solution must be over pH8.0 because it is the pH in which EDTA dissolves. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.13">Other chelating agents such as ethylenediamine, porphine and dimercaprol have the same effect as EDTA. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.13">
<s n="s1.2;p12.13">The beads remain yellow because yellow pNP was trapped inside the beads right after being produced by the enzymes inside the beads. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.13">The results may be lower than the real value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.13">
<s n="s1.2;p13.13">Binding enzymes to a solid support restricts the movement an enzyme can have. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.13">Since it has to change its shape (induced fit model) to form the enzyme-substrate complex, restricting its movement reduces the number of enzyme-substrate complexes that could be formed. </s>
