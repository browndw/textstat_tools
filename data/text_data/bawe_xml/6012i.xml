<head rend="bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.2;p2.24">Packaging is important in all food processing operations, and can be defined in terms of its protective role - 'packaging is a means of achieving safe delivery of products in sound condition to the final user at a minimum cost'. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.24">The functions of packaging are: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Containment - to hold the contents and keep them secure until used,</item>
<item>Protection - against mechanical and environmental hazards which may be encountered during distribution and use,</item>
<item>Communication - to identify the contents, assist in selling the product, and to provide other information such as heating guidelines or nutritional information,</item>
<item>Machinability - to have good performance on production lines,</item>
<item>Convenience - throughout the production, storage and distribution e.g. dispensing or ease of opening (Fellows, 2000).</item>
</list>
<p n="p3.24">
<s n="s1.5;p3.24">Packaging provides a barrier between the food and the environment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.24">It controls light transmission; the rate of transfer of heat, moisture and gases; and the movement of micro organisms and other pests. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.24">Moisture loss or uptake is one of the most important factors that controls the shelf life of foods. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.24">The permeability of the packaging, together with the vapour pressure of moisture in the food at the temperature of storage, will effect the moisture exchange, and as a result, will effect microbial and enzymic spoilage, condensation on the inside of packaging and resulting mould growth, drying out or softening of foods, or the extent of freezer burn (Fellows, 2000). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.24">Dehydrated foods require packaging that has a low permeability to moisture, otherwise they will lose their crispness, and if their water activity (a <hi rend="sub">w</hi>) rises above the level, which will permit microbial growth, they will spoil. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.3;p4.24">Foods that contain high levels of lipids or other oxygen-sensitive compounds are spoiled if the packaging has an inadequate barrier to oxygen. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.24">However, fresh foods, which are respiring, and have a high relative humidity (RH), require a degree of permeability to allow the exchange of CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> and O <hi rend="sub">2</hi>, without the excessive loss of moisture that would cause weight loss and shrivelling (Fellows, 2000). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.24">Chilled foods require controlled movement of water vapour out of the packaging to prevent fogging in display packs when the temperature changes, and foods packaged in modified atmospheres require careful control of both gas consumption and water vapour movement to achieve expected shelf life. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.1;p5.24">The table below illustrates selected properties of packaging films (Fellows, 2000): </s>

</table>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.4;p6.24">Packaging should be sufficiently impermeable to retain desirable odours and prevent odour-pick up, and there should be no noticeable odour pickup from plasticisers, inks, adhesives or solvents used in the manufacture of the packaging material. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.24">Plasticisers and pigments loosen the film structure and increase its permeability, however permeability is not just related to the type of film, it is also affected by the type of gas or vapour and the relative humidity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.24">Plastic films are joined together by heat seals; the strength of which is tested for various films in this experiment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.24">An inadequate heat seal in polymer films, caused by the contamination of the seal with the product or faulty heat sealer settings, is one of the main causes of microbial contamination of adequately processed foods (Fellows, 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.24">
<s n="s1.5;p7.24">The suitability of a packaging film to protect foods from environmental damage depends on its ability to withstand puncturing or fracturing. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.24">In this experiment the bursting strengths and heat seal strengths of the packaging films give an indication of their behaviour under stress. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.24">The molecular structure of polymer films may be aligned in different ways, depending on the type of film and the method of manufacture, and this will result in varying properties of strength for different films. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.24">A flexible packaging film is a non-rigid, non-fibrous plastic polymer, which is less than 250m thick (Fellows, 2000). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.24">There are a very large number of possible combinations of polymer and treatment, to meet the varied requirements of foods, providing a range of mechanical, optical, thermal and barrier properties: </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">Cellulose films</head>
<p n="p8.24">
<s n="s1.7;p8.24">Plain cellulose is a glossy, transparent film, which is odourless, tasteless and biodegradable in approximately 100 days. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.24">It is tough and puncture resistant, although it tears easily; and it is suitable for twist wrapping as it has low-slip and dead-folding properties. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.24">Cellulose films however are not suitable for heat-sealing, and the dimensions and permeability of the film will change with humidity. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.24">Cellulose films are used for foods that do not require a complete moisture or gas barrier, such as fresh bread, and some confectionary. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.24">Films are coated with other polymers to improve their barrier properties or to impart heat sealability, (Heiss, 1970) e.g. nitrocellulose is coated on one side of cellulose film to provide a moisture barrier but to retain oxygen permeability. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.24">A nitrocellulose coating on both sides of the film will improve the barrier to oxygen, moisture and odours, and enables the film to be heat sealed, providing a broad seal is used. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.24">Regenerated cellulose 350 MS is an example of a cellulose film coated with nitrocellulose (Palling, 1980). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">Polypropylene</head>
<p n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.6;p9.24">Orientated polypropylene is a clear glossy film with high tensile strength and puncture resistance and good optical properties. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.24">It is moderately permeable to moisture, gases and odours, however it is not affected by changes in humidity. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.24">Polypropylene has a density of 0.90 g/cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> (Palling, 1980). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.24">It is thermoplastic, and therefore stretches, and has low friction, which makes it suitable for use with high speed filling equipment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.24">Biaxially orientated polypropylene has similar properties, but is much stronger; both types are used for crisp packets, biscuit wrappers and boil-in-bag films, as well as many other applications. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.24">Polypropylene also lends itself to moulding, and is particularly useful in the field of injection moulding (Palling, 1980). </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">Polyethylene </head>
<p n="p10.24">
<s n="s1.5;p10.24">There are many types of polyethylene, which leads to a wide variability in properties. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.24">Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a very strong transparent glossy film; with good moisture and gas barriers and little shrinkage with variations in temperature or humidity. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.24">Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is heat sealable, chemically inert, odour free and shrinks when heated. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.24">It is a good moisture barrier, but has relatively high gas permeability, sensitivity to oils and poor odour resistance. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.24">LDPE has a high tear resistance and impact strength and can be used from temperatures as low as - 50 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C to about 70 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C, (Heiss, 1970). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.24">
<s n="s1.7;p11.24">It is less expensive than most films, and so is widely used for frozen foods, bread, meat pies and sausages, (Heiss, 1970), also including applications in shrink or stretch wrapping. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.24">The density of LDPE ranges from 0.916 - 0.935 g/cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> (Palling, 1980). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.24">High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is stronger, thicker, less flexible and more brittle than LDPE, and has a lower permeability to gases and moisture. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.24">HDPE has a high tear strength, tensile strength, penetration resistance and seal strength. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.24">The density of HDPE ranges from 0.95 - 0.965 g/cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi> (Palling, 1980). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.24">Polyethylenes are waterproof and chemically resistant and can be used for shrink-wrapping. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.24">It can be perforated with up to 80 holes cm <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> for use with fresh foods and bakery products, or when un-perforated, can be used for edible fats. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Polyvinylidene Chloride </head>
<p n="p12.24">
<s n="s1.3;p12.24">Uncoated PVdC film has very good moisture, odour and gas barrier properties; it is fat resistant and does not melt when in contact with hot fat, making it suitable for 'freezer-to-oven' foods. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.24">PVdC is also used as a coating for films and bottles to improve the barrier properties. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.24">PVdC film can also be used as cling film, by the addition of ketones or chlorinated hydrocarbons, to increase its flexibility (Heiss, 1970). </s>

<s n="s6.8;p24.24">This may be due to added plasticisers, which loosen the film structure and increase its permeability, and may also be because of the thinness of the film. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p24.24">Cling film (Polyvinylidene Chloride) is normally used for short-term wrapping of poultry, which requires controlled movement of water vapour out of the packaging to prevent fogging in display packs when the temperature changes; and cheeses, because it is fat resistant; it is also widely used in the home. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p24.24">These results suggest it should not be used for foods with strong flavours or odours, or foods, which require controlled movement of water vapour, such as dehydrated foods that if their water activity (a <hi rend="sub">w</hi>) rises above a set level, will permit microbial growth, and therefore spoilage. </s>
