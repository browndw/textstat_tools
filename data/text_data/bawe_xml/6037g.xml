<s n="s1.3;p27.32">The results of this study showed that green tea had the greatest antioxidant capacity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.32">This was because green tea contained many flavonoids that possessed the antioxidant properties. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.32">Green tea had the largest absorbance value at 593 nm of 1.8950 and absorbance was used to measure colour intensity and colour intensity was proportional to antioxidant capacity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.32">
<s n="s1.2;p28.32">As the general trend for vitamin C was an increase in antioxidant capacity with increasing concentration, this could be used to compare the fruit juices and teas and coffees tested. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.32">Only the more concentrated vitamin C samples of 1500 and 2000µM had similar values to the beverages tested. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.32">
<s n="s1.1;p29.32">The antioxidant capacity was important to investigate as the antioxidants quenched free radicals that reduce damage to the body. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.32">
<s n="s1.3;p30.32">The reproducibility of the results is achievable as there are no difficult stages in the method. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.32">However absorbance values need to be repeated a number of times in this experiment because values vary for the same sample. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.32">This can be overcome by calculating an average of the absorbance readings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.32">
<s n="s1.4;p31.32">The literature values were difficult to obtain to check results were in the right order of magnitude. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p31.32">However a study on ascorbic acid concentration and FRAP assay suggested FRAP values of between 273 - 1270 µM (ref 4). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.32">Most of the vitamin C values obtained were within this range; however the higher concentrations of vitamin C had a higher FRAP value of 2041.86 µM. The FRAP values may not have been very accurate because the results for the standard vitamin C may not have been accurate as this standard value was calculated from the equation of the line. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.32">These absorbance values should have been repeated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.32">
<s n="s1.1;p32.32">The study provides information on antioxidant capacity of different foods and beverages and this could be used to aid consumers when selecting a diet where they want to increase there antioxidants. </s>
