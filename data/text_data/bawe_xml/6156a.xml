<p n="p1.16">
<s rend="bold" n="s1.2;p1.16">The results of a 2006 Food Frequency Questionnaire, filled out by 86 eager first years at <name type="university"/>, show remarkably modest levels of alcohol consumption. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.16">This Questionnaire was part of a Dietary Survey used to establish the nutritional components of these students' diet over the previous 7 days. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.2;p2.16">The results showed that all 86 subjects - 23 males and 63 females - had relatively well-proportioned, nutrient-rich diets with few significant deviations. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.16">Yet surprisingly it also revealed that they had an average alcohol consumption of only 17.2g per day. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.2;p3.16">Based on Government figures this converts to 2 units per day - equivalent to a pint of ordinary strength larger such as Fosters. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.16">This would probably shock most of us as few would suspect that drinking more than one Fosters would be classed as "going on a binge". </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.2;p4.16">Binge or no binge, drinking is still thought to be a major part of a students' life. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.16">Yet, according to these recent figures, female students at <name type="university"/> consume on average 2 units a night and males only 3 - both a unit below the national maximum recommendations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.4;p5.16">You would only need to go out once with a student to see that this level of alcohol consumption is grossly under-par. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.16">So what does it mean? </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.16">Are <name type="university"/> students truly as angelic as the figures imply? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.16">The truth is that there are many major inaccuracies associated with questionnaires such as these. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.2;p6.16">Food frequency questionnaires are no exception. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.16">They are suitable for large-scale surveys and can focus on specific nutrients in the diet, yet they often have over-estimation of nutrients and under-estimation of unhealthy foods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.2;p7.16">Whether they are accurate or not these students still show alcohol consumption levels below the maximum recommended amount. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.16">Yet, compared with a 2003 National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), these students have daily alcohol intakes far above the national means. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6156a-fig.001">
<head>Comparison of Students' Vitamin Consumption with UK RNIs</head>
</figure>
<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.2;p8.16">This 2003 study recorded daily intakes of 21.9g of alcohol per day for men and a shockingly low 9.3g for woman. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.16">Comparing the University's 2006 figures for female consumption with the NDNS' 2003, it shows that students knock back the equivalent of a whopping 11 bottles of 40% vodka, or 141 pints of lager more per year. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.16">
<s n="s1.1;p9.16">The best explanation for these differences is that this study is nearly 4 years out of date and doesn't take into account the nation-wide increase in alcohol consumption (especially in females) since then. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.16">
<s n="s1.3;p10.16">This increase in alcohol consumption requires an increase in nutrient intake. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.16">This is due to alcohol's 'empty calories' - energy without nutrients. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.16">But are <name type="university"/>'s students doing this? </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.16">
<s n="s1.2;p11.16">Alcohol, as well as not giving any nutrients, also takes them away. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.16">God's gift to hangovers, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), one of the many vitamins depleted by alcohol, was found in relatively high levels in <name type="university"/> students' diet - almost twice the RNI (Reference Nutrient Intake) of it in males. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.16">
<s n="s1.3;p12.16">RNIs are part of the government's Dietary Reference Values (DRV). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.16">These values are compiled to get an idea of an individual's nutrient requirement. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.16">RNIs represent the amount that meets the nutritional needs of most people. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.16">
<s n="s1.2;p13.16">
<name type="university"/>'s levels of Vitamin B2 (for those bloodshot eyes), Zinc (for alcohol metabolism) and Vitamin C (anti-oxidant fighting the baddies in alcohol) are all well above the RNIs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.16">However the questionnaire also picked up on Potassium and Iron deficiencies (only in females) that would no doubt hamper the body in combating the effects of alcohol. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.16">
<s n="s1.4;p14.16">A new area of research is investigating the effectiveness of Phosphorus in treating alcohol withdrawal symptoms. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.16">Funnily enough <name type="university"/> students have abnormally high levels of Phosphorus in their diet. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.16">All subjects have more than double the RNI and males are even over the safe upper limit! </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.16">Could there be a hidden message behind this strange discovery? </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.16">
<s n="s1.3;p15.16">Whether <name type="university"/> Students are in fact recovering alcoholics or just misunderstood youths remains to be seen. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.16">Nonetheless, <name type="university"/> students appear to be consuming more alcohol than the national means (for 2003), while still managing to keep their units per day below the maximum recommended amount. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.16">This paradoxical set of results leaves us questioning their accuracy - which, with the national trends showing huge increases in alcohol consumption, would not be a bad thing to do! </s>
