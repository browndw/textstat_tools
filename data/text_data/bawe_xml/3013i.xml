<s n="s1.2;p1.39">The following report analyses the business environment in South Korea, by comparing cultural and institutional factors, to those found in the UK, as part of a market assessment strategy for expansion. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.39">The results of the initial environmental analysis impact people management approaches, and therefore recommendations and justifications have been put forth to assist the evaluation of changes needed for a bakery group, Saint Fusion, when considering entering the country. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.39">
<s n="s1.4;p2.39">Using the PESTE framework it was found that Korea is a significantly attractive country for business investment, especially in hospitality, as tourism is one of the country's fastest growing industries. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.39">Its increasing levels of growth, rising consumer disposable income and expenditure, which adding to economic reforms and encouraging foreign direct investment policies have contributed to making Korea the current twelfth biggest world economy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.39">The emphasis on education has created a pool of highly skilled professionals which in combination with vocationally trained staff provide the basis for Saint Fusion's core staff. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.39">Further, employment law reforms introducing flexible work further encourage hospitality investment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.39">
<s n="s1.3;p3.39">However, cultural differences and their impact on people management approaches are significant. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.39">Characteristics including high power distance, uncertainty avoidance, feminism, long-term orientation and collectivism should result in a hierarchy-based organizational structure and the use of personnel management for operative staff, to meet collectivist and feminist needs, with a consequent progress towards soft human resource management as hierarchical levels progress. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.39">Further implications include: a focus on intrinsic rewards (motivation and reward), opportunities to acquire and develop new skills (training and development) and the management of equal opportunities at operative level diversity management at managerial. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.39">
<s n="s1.1;p4.39">In conclusion, the incorporation of the above factors in a polycentric/regiocentric approach would guarantee the transformation of differences into opportunities and provide competitive advantages for Saint Fusion. </s>

<p n="p5.39">
<s n="s1.3;p5.39">This report analyses the business environment in South Korea, by comparing cultural and institutional factors, to those found in the UK, as part of a market assessment strategy for expansion. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.39">The results of the initial environmental analysis certainly impact people management approaches, and therefore recommendations and justifications have been put forth to assist the evaluation of changes needed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.39">Appendix 1 gives an overview of Saint Fusion and its marketing strategy for Korea. </s>

<head rend="bold">2. Business Environment</head>
<p n="p6.39">
<s n="s1.2;p6.39">The PESTE framework was chosen to compare UK and Korean business environments and analyse the impact of cultural differences on people management approaches as it provides an overview of the countries' macro-environment, pinpointing challenges and opportunities and suggesting the level of adaptability needed for people management techniques (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004; Brewster &amp; Tyson, 1991; Zhu &amp; Warner, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.39">Elements of business systems theory, which suggests a country's institutions affect people management (Brewster, 2006), are used alongside cultural differences to justify diverse practices (Sorge, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.39">
<s n="s1.6;p7.39">Many definitions of 'culture' exist because it is a term applied in various social sciences and domains. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.39">Nonetheless, these are cohesive in stating culture as a combination of different factors, implied (i.e. morals and customs) and apparent (i.e. conduct), where fundamental beliefs are portrayed in behaviour (Groeschl &amp; Doherty, 2000). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.39">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede (2005) add that culture is so deeply-rooted it explains national differences (e.g. the role of the government, approaches to work, legislative structure, economy and demographics). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.39">A connection is then established that the culturalist and the institutionalist perspectives are interdependent and both influence HRM policies (Brewster, 2006; Sorge, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.39">Consequently, cultural justifications are provided throughout the analysis to validate UK and South Korean institutional differences. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.39">Important to mention however, that Hofstede's arguments are based on research performed over two decades ago and their reliability (Brewster, 2006; Pizam, Pine, Mok &amp; Shin, 1997), especially in South Korea's case is questionable due to recent changes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.39">
<s n="s1.15;p8.39">Korea's favourable economic situation with rising rate of growth and GNI per capita offers many business opportunities for foreign direct investment (FDI)-appendix 2. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p8.39">Recent government efforts showing the country's openness to internationalisation are proven by policies restructuring the economy and reforming employment laws (World Bank, 2004), free trade agreements (FTA), mainly with the US (Foreign Relations News, 2006)-appendix 2-and sanctions on businesses (for restaurants the max. fine is 500.000 won) if they do not adopt the international metric system (Nation News, 2006). </s>
<s n="s3.15;p8.39">These changes have resulted in Korea becoming the twelfth largest world economy (BBC, 2006), and adding to the mentioned positive political and economic changes, assist hospitality organizations entering the country. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p8.39">Korea, however, was not always this "open"; until recently it had major government corruption, suggestions of which still remain (U.S Library of Congress, 2005; appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s5.15;p8.39">A striking difference in policies between the UK and Korea is the amount of strict regulations, detailed formalities and government intervention in public and private affairs (taxation, education, politics-appendix 2) in the latter in comparison to the apparently deregulated UK (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s6.15;p8.39">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede (2005) suggest this is typical of collectivist societies (appendix 3), where government intervention is justified by protecting the interests of the whole over the individual. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p8.39">Economic indications of collectivist societies (predominant in Asia) include reduced wealth (Korea's GNI per capita is lower than UK figures-appendix 2), the existence and influence of <hi rend="italic">chaebols</hi> in a country's economy and the use of force to implement new economic practices-e.g. severe fines for small business if they do not implement the international metric system-(Hofstede, 2001). </s>
<s n="s8.15;p8.39">On the other hand, the UK's political environment and low government intervention propose a high regard for individual interests reflected in strong values for social justice and human rights and each council determining its planning regulations (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s9.15;p8.39">Economic evidences of individuality are seen in free-market policies which encourage competition, significantly higher levels of wealth (appendix 2), and emphasis on freedom (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
<s n="s10.15;p8.39">The UK's lack of formality and rules suggests people are more relaxed and ambiguity tolerant, the absolute opposite is seen in Korea and reflected in the degree of uncertainty avoidance (UA)-appendix 3. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p8.39">Collectivism is also reflected in the existence and power of trade unions. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p8.39">Although Korea is highly-unionized, this is mainly in manufacturing (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004) with no evidence of unions in hospitality and the federations of tourism and women workers having the lowest numbers of affiliated unions and members (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s13.15;p8.39">The UK in contrast, has a union for bakers and associated food workers; however its role seems to be to provide information for individual workers rather than intervention (BFAWU, 2006). </s>
<s n="s14.15;p8.39">Certainly the UK offers favourable conditions for investment though its market competitiveness poses survival challenges for some companies. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p8.39">Korea's recent government policy changes shown in increased westernization and business transparency suggest an inclination towards more individualist ideals<ref target="BAWE_3013i-ftnote.001"/>, which certainly has major advantages, when competing with some neighbouring Asian countries, to attract FDI. Comparing the two countries' political and economic landscapes, and contrasting the UK's prevalent values of autonomy, self-interest and competition, with Korea's control, formality and group values, it is clear that Saint Fusion Korea's people management approaches should be contextualised and include group management and strong manager-staff relationships where status is emphasized yet moderated with goodwill (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>

<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3013i-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The argument that countries may have moved along a particular dimension since Hofstede's study is supported by Pizam <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">(1997). </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p9.39">
<s n="s1.10;p9.39">In response to neighbouring booming and large-scale economies, which highlight high cost production and constrain export potential (Tong-soo, 2006), Korea is tackling its internal problems, to attract FDI, by improving labour market policies (About Korea, 2006a), introducing flexible work (appendix 5) rising the retirement age, and legislating age/women discrimination acts (About Korea, 2006a). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p9.39">Further efforts include opening job centres, the introduction of an annual pay system (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004) and making work insurance available to everyone-only implemented in 2003 (U.S. Library of Congress, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p9.39">These new policies significantly affect hospitality (especially greater female participation) and mainly the bakery sector which needs flexible shifts and working hours to maximize labour productivity. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p9.39">However, despite the improvements, there are still many stiff regulations regarding employability in Korea (appendix 4). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p9.39">Nonetheless, apart from reflecting greater gender equality, flexible work (appendix 5) demonstrates Korea's feminism, where a work/life balance is crucial, both genders have the same opportunities for the same vocations and there is a prevalence of service industry jobs (appendix 2)-Hofstede, 2001. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p9.39">The UK on the other hand, is a masculine country (appendix 3), where gender roles are still rather differentiated, competition dominates and returns are impartial. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p9.39">As female participation in the workforce is not a reflection of feminism (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005), the UK's tightening gap between male and female work participation is attributed to improving attitudes towards working women, their increasing qualifications and returning to work after having children (UK National Statistics, 2005). </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.39">The OECD (2006) asserts wage differences between male and female workers relate to the amount of time women spend in the labour force, the jobs they choose and the high incidence of part-time employment (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p9.39">Further evidence suggesting masculinity and specific gender roles is the very low number of working mums, especially with children under five. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p9.39">To adapt to Korea's feminine culture Saint Fusion should foster pleasant relationships between superiors and subordinates and cooperation, opposing its UK aim of inculcating a sense of accomplishment and job recognition- typical of masculine societies (Romani, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.39">
<s n="s1.9;p10.39">Socio-cultural challenges for hospitality businesses in Korea include a homogeneous population, predominance of the national language, social class and Confucianism (appendix 2); which refer to different aspects of culture (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005) and prove high levels of UA (appendix 3)-a geographical characteristic (Hofstede, 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.9;p10.39">Conversely, UK's high immigration levels have brought diverse languages, ethnicities, nationalities, levels of education, types of profession, and religions, and consequently innovation and diversity (UK National Statistics, 2005), proving much tolerance towards difference and uncertainty (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p10.39">Further implications lie in how people regard social disparity and their association with power. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p10.39">In the UK, status and power are unimportant, however in Korea, these are differentiators of social class, linked to greater respect, formality (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005) and believed to bring stability through social inequality (power distance-PD), though also balanced with a greater sense of responsibility (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p10.39">PD is found in societies where there are wage discrepancies and evidence of violence in the country's politics (Hofstede, 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p10.39">Korea, which ranked above average in PD (appendix 3), shows recent evidence of oppression, violence and corruption in its government and women earn half of men's wages (appendix 2); however, this figure is contradicted, at least in the hotel industry, with the ILO's (2006) figures on male/female wages (appendix 2), and importantly, Hofstede (2001) states PD relates to wage disparities at an organizational level and not gender differences. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p10.39">The situation in the UK is much different (low PD-appendix 3), there are no indices of internal political violence, and emphasis is on low hierarchical structures, equality, small wage differences and consultation before decision-making. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p10.39">Further reflections of high PD in Korea which need to be considered are the submission of the weak, extensive hierarchies, concentration of power and the idea that social inequality is a norm (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p10.39">The implications of PD on Saint Fusion Korea's HRM strategy are significant and more rigid organizational structures, with increased hierarchical levels, and a broader range of salaries is to be considered. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.39">
<s n="s1.4;p11.39">Social inequality and collectivism mentioned above are also characteristic of Confucianism, a set of ethical principles predominant in Asia, which additionally includes perseverance, keeping "face", education, hard work, sacrifice and the prevalence of relationships over duty-<hi rend="italic">guanxi</hi> (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.39">The emphasis on immediate work for future rewards gives Korean society a long-term orientation-LTO (appendix 3). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.39">Though Confucianism justifies Korea's highly qualified labour market and equips organizations with skilled workforces (appendix 2), its LTO also demands significant changes to human resources management (HRM) from what is practised in the UK, as the latter is characterized by a focus on immediate outcomes, importance of jobs over relationships and tradition-short-term orientation-STO (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.39">Saint Fusion Korea's HRM managers should consider longer contracts and increased training/skills development opportunities (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005), which oppose the UK's focus on immediate results (Romani, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.39">
<s n="s1.3;p12.39">Technological progress (appendix 2) in both countries is precious for hospitality success, enabling companies to adapt to both converging and non-converging cultural elements. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.39">Technology's impact on HRM is the need for highly skilled professionals to use it, e.g. in the UK, professional managers are needed to interpret soft data so to identify trends. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.39">Given that Saint Fusion will apply these ICT developments in Korea, the same specialised skills should be looked for in managers. </s>

<head rend="bold">3. Strategic Orientation for People Management</head>
<p n="p13.39">
<s n="s1.7;p13.39">A company's strategic people management orientation depends on the host-country's national and organizational cultures. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.39">International companies moving into new countries are more likely to find their culture eventually assimilate that of the host country, rather than their host country employees' beliefs altered by the organizational culture (Hodgetts &amp; Luthans, 1997). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.39">Additional influences in determining centricity profiles include targets market characteristics and origin (Doherty, 1998), expansion strategy, home-country influence (Roper, Brookes, Price &amp; Hampton, 1997) and employment regulations (Harzing, 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p13.39">Three different perspectives determine centricity, namely the management mind-set, the companies' tendencies and the host-country manager's perspective, resulting in polycentrism, geocentrism and ethnocentrism (Roper <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.39">, 1997). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.39">Harris, Brewster &amp; Sparrow (2003), further introduce the regiocentric approach. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.39">Important to note that no company depicts any centricity profile in entirety, but rather reflects its tendencies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.39">
<s n="s1.8;p14.39">Ethnocentrism suggests parent country staff and management policies are superior to those of the host country (management mindset) (Roper <hi rend="italic"> et al</hi>., 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p14.39">This reflects in significant expatriates in host-country management, moving across the organisation maintaining home-country managerial practices (Edwards, 2004) and host-country people management decisions made at company headquarters-power centralization (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.8;p14.39">2003). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p14.39">Though ethnocentricity maximizes the use of limited resources, lowers costs and increases control, it best suits home-country targets, overlooks host-country cultural differences and consequently fails to consider host-country staff interests (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.8;p14.39">1997). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p14.39">The need for UK nationals in Saint Fusion Korea is unnecessary as labour market reforms and high levels of education have significantly increased the availability of highly skilled staff-appendix 2-(Edwards, 2004). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p14.39">Despite reform, many employment law differences remain (appendix 4) which added to sustained cultural differences pose significant challenges to an ethnocentric approach. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p14.39">As examples, a preference for home-country nationals clashes with Korea's nationalism and homogeneity; low hierarchical levels in the UK oppose significant PD in Korea (Hofstede, 2001), and would confuse host-country nationals as to their relationship with superiors; young UK managers in a context where father-figure superiors are sought after, representing status and power, would not be appreciated by staff; UK nationals would have difficulty understanding the collectivist nature of the workforce (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.39">
<s n="s1.4;p15.39">As a mindset, polycentrism holds that host-country nationals are the best to show loyalty and understanding towards their country's institutions and culture (Roper <hi rend="italic"> et al.,</hi> 1997), hunce crucial to work in the host country (Doherty, 1998). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.39">Polycentrism is most common in adaptive organizations that give subsidiaries decision-making independence (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.39">1997) and tailor people management policies (Doherty, 1998). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.39">Though convenient in countries where legal, political and significant cultural differences persist it does challenge a company's ability to offer a consistent product, especially if it is a multinational group (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.39">
<s n="s1.3;p16.39">Regiocentrism, links with a regional business strategy and organizational structure, is broader than polycentrism and from an HRM perspective, allows host country nationals to move around the area, gain experience, be promoted and make strategic decisions affecting their region (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.39">1997). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.39">It applies to companies with regional target markets and country cluster strategies, allowing for similar practices to be brought together (Edwards, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.39">
<s n="s1.2;p17.39">Geocentrism is an ideal (Doherty, 1998) HR orientation, with global companies identifying advantages in diverse cultural practices and adjusting them to different contexts. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.39">It prioritizes skills over nationalities and executives support both equal parent/host country systems and the application of cultural/institutional/organizational resemblances at a global level (Harris et al, 1997; Roper et al, 1997). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.39">
<s n="s1.8;p18.39">Knowing the human resource strategy should be integrated in the business orientation (Storey, 1992; Riley &amp; Jones, 1992), and Saint Fusion Korea is adopting, from a marketing perspective, mainly regiocentric tendencies (appendix 1), its people management strategy should also have a regiocentric orientation (appendix 6). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p18.39">Korean nationals are recommended at operative level due to different environments, employment law, bureaucratic work permits which do not validate importing all employees (appendix 6), but also to significant cultural dissimilarities (Edwards, 2004)-appendices 2, 4-which justify local operative staff as best serve consumer, employee, and company interests. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p18.39">Unit managers, however should be from around Asia (initially Tokyo and Hong Kong-appendix 1) because of fewer cultural differences but also due to mobility. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p18.39">Given Saint Fusion's moderate operation, it is more cost-efficient to bring managers from close by, who understand the group's regional business goals and work towards them by adding creative, yet appropriate, management practices. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p18.39">Once Koreans are trained they should also move around the region, experiment and so enrich Saint Fusion's culture (appendix 6). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p18.39">Saint Fusion's reliance on its in-housel market at managerial levels is important to guarantee standards and consistency (Doherty, 1998), though its flexibility also extends to hiring managers from the external market with significant training before occupying their positions. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p18.39">The same ought to apply to national and regional managers so to foster innovation and entrepreneurial activities which are crucial to the Saint Fusion concept (appendix 1). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p18.39">The latter should come mainly from Saint Fusion's internal market and be third-country nationals (Asian) with regular temporary visits from parent-country executives to certify strategic alignment with the company's international goals. </s>

</p>
<p n="p21.39">
<s n="s1.10;p21.39">The most common approaches to managing human resources are personnel management (PM) and human resource management (HRM). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p21.39">There seems to be confusion in related literature as to the real differences between HRM and PM, though what prevails is HRM as a development of PM resulting from reduced trade union power and increased competition. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p21.39">This created a need to shift focus from collective employee representation to direct employer/employee relationships, to better maximize performance and reach business objectives-universalist approach (Storey, 1992; Price, 1997), and is shown in performance appraisals, increased earnings, acknowledgement of individual achievement and direct communication of bad news (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005; Brewster, 2006, Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>

<p n="p22.39">
<s n="s1.9;p22.39">The above and mentioned differences (appendices 2, 4, Business Environment), and link between HRM and universalism, suggest a contextual approach to people management is more viable for Saint Fusion. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p22.39">The main cultural elements that suggest a different approach in Korea relate to relationship values which entail inequality, hierarchy, benevolence, importance to manual workers and a 'family environment' (Zhu &amp; Warner, 2004; Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005); these significantly contradict the UK work environment and therefore have implications on the choice between HRM and PM. Collectivism is both a cultural dimension and a Confucian principle which always regards the individual as part of a system (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p22.39">It links with PD, regarding the workforce as a unit where mutual responsibilities of security are exchanged for fidelity (Zhu &amp; Warner, 2004; Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2001), therefore also suggesting a different approach from that in the UK, where emphasis is on individual interests, personal achievement, autonomy, lack of formal rules and regulations and narrow pay differentials (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>

<s n="s5.9;p22.39">Korea's feminine mindset is also highly contradictory to the UK's masculine ideology and certainly impacts on approaches to managing human resources, especially in relation to the notion of Ying and Yang, reflected in the workplace as an endeavour to achieve and maintain harmony, stability and continuity (Zhu &amp; Warner, 2004). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p22.39">Conversely, employees in the UK commonly display assertiveness, and self-interest (related to individuality), a need for acknowledgment, challenges, and progress (both in terms of responsibility and pay) (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>

<s n="s1.15;p25.39">When considering the domestic labour market, especially availability and cost, Saint Fusion has an advantage, as appendix 2 shows the existence of employees with high qualifications, an increase in demand for tertiary jobs (especially in hospitality), high productivity and employment and very low wages compared to the UK. Considering the above factors, company training opportunities and career progression, type of product/service requiring more practical skills rather than expertise (Guerrier, 1999; appendix 7), Saint Fusion's staff will be supplied mainly by vocational training (About Korea, 2006) and secondary school graduates (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s2.15;p25.39">The availability of skills in the domestic labour market, increasing employment, especially in hospitality (appendix 2), secure Saint Fusion's source of professional skills (appendix 2), growth opportunities and competitiveness (Price, 1997). </s>
<s n="s3.15;p25.39">Considering recent employment law reforms, mainly increased flexibility (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004; appendix 5), Saint Fusion should primarily operate on a core staff basis, though during periods of increased demand, temporary staff could also be employed to further assist operations (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>

<s n="s7.15;p25.39">Throughout the day, depending on demand, tasks can be reallocated to keep costs down (functional flexibility within each organizational level, Guerrier, 1999) but also to tie in with notions of collectivism and LTO, where training &amp; development (multi-skilling) and lasting career opportunities are important (Price, 1997; Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s>
<s n="s8.15;p25.39">This will maintain Saint Fusion's PM/standardized product approach but also include some 'soft' HRM elements (commitment, development) so to also tie in with cultural needs (appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s9.15;p25.39">All operative staff can be provided from the local labour market, whereas unit and national managers should be a mixture of internal/external, local/regional markets (staff reallocation), as evidence of career progression but also to stimulate innovation (Price, 1997). </s>
<s n="s10.15;p25.39">Regional executives should come mainly from Saint Fusion's internal market and be third-country nationals (Asian) with regular visits from parent-country executives (in accordance with Saint Fusion's centricity-see Strategic Orientation). </s>

<s n="s12.15;p25.39">Because of operation size, work permit bureaucracy (appendix 6), and high costs, it is not justifiable to have permanent expatriates on the regional board. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p25.39">With this in mind, recruiting strategies will vary from suitability to flexibility (appendix 6). </s>
<s n="s14.15;p25.39">Operative level staff could be recruited on a 'best fit' approach, linking to the company's PM (Storey, 1992) and standardized service (Doherty, 1998), however, it should not be as strict as Price (1997) suggests, as once employed and corresponding to Korea's culture, employees go through training and teamwork, whilst integrating into Saint Fusion's culture (malleability strategy). </s>

<p n="p27.39">
<s n="s1.3;p27.39">Since PM principles prevail at operative level (appendix 7), and considering the Korean culture and a company's obligation to meet employee work goals, motivators should include programmed training and multi-tasking-see Resourcing. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p39.39">This report has looked at differences in people management approaches in Korea and UK.
