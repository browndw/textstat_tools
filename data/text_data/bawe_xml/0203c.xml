<p n="p20.98">
<s n="s1.5;p20.98">In summary <name type="other"/> presented with a 2 day history of severe abdominal pain and one episode of vomiting. <name type="other"/> described the pain as being around his umbilicus and radiating to the right iliac fossa. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.98">This indicates that the pain around the umbilicus is referred pain from the midgut (midgut structures being distal duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, appendix, ascending colon and 2/3 transverse colon). <name type="other"/> also described the pain as being colicky in nature. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.98">This occurs due to the contraction of smooth muscle against resistance in e.g. ureters, intestine. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.98">The pain could therefore be referred from the small intestine. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p21.98">The first three symptoms have been illustrated in the history and so the <hi rend="bold">distension can be looked for on examination</hi>, however not all of these 4 features need to be present in a case of intestinal obstruction. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p21.98">Small bowel obstruction is commonly caused by adhesions due to scars from previous surgery. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p21.98">From <name type="other"/>'s history we know that he has <hi rend="bold">previously had operations on his abdomen</hi> and so this may be a potential cause for his presenting complaint. </s>

<name type="other"/> has also previously had a laparotomy to remove adhesions. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p21.98">
<hi rend="bold">Bowel sounds should be auscultated</hi> to rule out a paralytic ileus (pseudo obstruction due to reduced bowel motility). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p21.98">However, this most commonly occurs post operatively or can be due to anticholinergic agents - none of which apply to <name type="other"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p21.98">Bowel sounds are normally found to be tinkling in small bowel obstruction. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p21.98">Other causes of small bowel obstruction include; malignancy (very rare in small intestine and <name type="other"/> stated that there had been no weight loss), intersussception (common in children &lt;4 yrs), volvulus and impacted faeces. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.98">
<s n="s1.4;p22.98">The pain in the right iliac fossa could be due to a hernia and so the <hi rend="bold">hernial orifices</hi> should be palpated on examination. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.98">Small bowel obstruction could result from a strangulation of the bowel and this occurs frequently in femoral hernias as the neck of the femoral canal is narrow. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.98">It is important to identify a strangulated femoral hernia/strangulated bowel as they are associated with a high mortality rate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.98">Features suggesting strangulation to look for on examination include; rapid pulse, pyrexia, colicky pain becoming continuous as peritonitis develops, tenderness and abdominal rigidity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.98">
<s n="s1.6;p23.98">Midgut pain which radiates to the right iliac fossa is also indicative of appendicitis. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p23.98">There is often guarding over the site of the appendix (McBurneys point) on examination due to the inflammatory process spreading to involve the wall of the peritoneum producing localised intense pain which is continuous and so this should be looked for on examination. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p23.98">However the initial midgut pain is often dull in nature and becomes severe when the peritoneum is involved. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p23.98">Bowel sounds are often absent as the abdomen becomes tender and rigid. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p23.98">Appendicitis is also associated with vomiting which <name type="other"/> stated in his history. </s>
