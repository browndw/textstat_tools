<s n="s1.3;p2.13">Reasearch in this field before 2002 determined the most efficient way to carry out the addition of organic groups to amines was to synthesise the imine precursor and use a dialkylzinc reagent with a chiral catalyst. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.13">Although highly enantioselective, harsh oxidising, reducing or acidic conditions were necessary for cleavage of the protecting group to afford the α-chiral amine [1]. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.13">Such precursors used included N-aryl- and N-sulphonylimines. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.2;p3.13">Further work by Boezio et al. in 2002 showed that use of an <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-phosphinoylimine precursor (<hi rend="bold">2</hi>) with a diphosphine ligand (Me-DuPHOS) (<hi rend="bold">3</hi>) in the presence of a copper(II) triflate catalyst gave high yields and good enantiomeric excesses on reaction with diethyl and higher diorganiczinc reagents. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.13">The diphenylphosphine protecting group could be cleaved under mild conditions (HCl, MeOH, rt., 2h). </s>

<s n="s1.2;p4.13">However, the addition of dimethylzinc to produce a methyl substituted α-chiral amine required at least 10eq. of Me <hi rend="sub">2</hi>Zn and 10mol % catalyst loadings. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.13">Lower numbers of equivalents gave low yields and poor enantiocontrol. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p5.13">Boezio, Charette and Côté concentrated their research on designing a ligand for this catalyst system that would overcome this problem. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.13">They observed a rate acceleration for the addition of dimethylzinc to the <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-phosphinoylimine benzaldehyde derivative in the presence of monodentate, and semi-labile bidentate phosphine ligands. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.13">After screening several ligands they discovered that Me-DuPHOS monoxide (BozPHOS) (<hi rend="bold">4</hi>) was an effective ligand for the transformation. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p7.13">They found the catalyst system was quite general for the addition of diorganozinc reagents to <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-phosphinoyl protected amines. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.13">Methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl and even functionalised dialkylzinc reagents could be used in the reaction giving high yields (>84%) and high enantioselectivities (>90%). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.13">Monodentate phosphine and phosphine oxide ligands were synthesised which both gave high yields but no enantiomeric control. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.13">The borane adduct of Me-DuPHOS, a mono-protected intermediate in the conversion of Me-DuPHOS to BozPHOS was found to have little catalytic activity in the reaction. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.13">It was hypothesised that the enantiomeric control was due to the cooperative binding of both phosphine groups on the ligand. </s>

<p n="p9.13">
<s n="s1.3;p9.13">The research presented here represents a significant step in this field. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.13">The preparation of methyl substituted α-chiral amines was impractical and expensive before this work was carried out. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.13">An improved ligand has been presented for the copper catalysed addition of dimethyl and a range of other dialkylzincs to <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-phosphinoylimines. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.13">One major limitation of this system is the availability of the <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-phosphinoylimine precursor. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.13">This has to be prepared from the aldehyde before reaction. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.13">Whereas the protected arylimine precursors reported here are stable, alkyl ones are sometimes inaccessible and those that can be sythesised suffer from instability. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.13">Indeed, more recent work in this area has used this catalyst system and focused on preparation of the <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-phosphinoylimine precursor <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> in an effort to overcome this problem [2]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.13">
<s n="s1.4;p11.13">The supporting information gives details of experimental procedures and spectroscopic data for each reaction. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.13">Unfortunately, no conclusive evidence is given and no attempt is made at a proposed mechanism for the catalysed reaction in this communication, or in previous work [1]. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.13">It appears that little is known about the interaction of Cu(OTf)<hi rend="sub">2</hi> with the ligand in this reaction, we are merely told it is used in preference to other metal compounds such as Zn(OTf)<hi rend="sub">2</hi> because it has been shown to work. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.13">Computational studies of the reacting transition states would be welcomed to elucidate what nature of the catalytic interactions. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.13">The American Chemical Society's flagship journal is the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.13">It is well read by chemists; with more articles cited than any other journal in 2004 [3]. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.13">JACS communications are designed to be concise reports of work that the authors feel should be delivered with some immeadiacy to a general audience. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.13">This paper is easy to read and conveys the necessary information clearly and concisely in the style expected in JACS. However, it reports merely on improvements in a field of synthetic chemistry, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. enantioselective amine synthesis, and one has to ask will this be of interest to the majority of the readership of the journal? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.13">I would expect a paper such as this to be published in a more specialised journal such as the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Organic Chemistry</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.13">
<s n="s1.3;p13.13">In summary, this work represents a significant advance in this field. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.13">Although the catalytic system proposed has its limitations, further work has overcome these. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.13">This paper's publication is well justified, although a more thorough investigation of the reaction would be welcomed. </s>
