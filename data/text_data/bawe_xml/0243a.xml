<s n="s1.5;p4.91">The investigation involved the use a cantilever beam with strain gauges attached to the top and bottom at the same distance along the beam. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.91">The application of force at the end of the beam causes a variation in the resistance in the strain gauges. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.91">This variation can be measured by analysing the output voltage produced by the system, called a Wheatstone Deflection Bridge. </s>
