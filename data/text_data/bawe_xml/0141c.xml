<head>Abstract:</head>
<p n="p1.13">
<s n="s1.8;p1.13">This experiment involved determining the distribution of succinate dehydrogenase between three subcellular compartments; namely the nucleus, mitochondria and cytosol. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.13">These fractions, obtained from homogenation of rat (<hi rend="italic">Rattus</hi> <hi rend="italic">rattus</hi>) liver cells, were examined under a phase contrast microscope to examine degree of contamination. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.13">Then the protein and succinate dehydrogenase content of each fraction was determined. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.13">A standard curve of BSA in water was constructed (appendix p.6) and total protein content was assayed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.13">Succinate dehydrogenase activity was assayed by monitoring reduction of INT into a coloured compound. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.13">Hence, the enzyme's activity was calculated. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.13">It was concluded that the supernatant cytosol fraction contained the most protein but the mitochondrial fraction the most enzyme. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.13">From the calculations, it was deduced that the mitochondrial fraction contained the most specific succinate dehydrogenase activity, with a value of 2.03 units of activity / mg protein. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head>Introduction:</head>
<p n="p2.13">
<s n="s1.4;p2.13">Succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the citric acid cycle. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.13">The enzyme transfers two hydrogen atoms from succinate to the cofactor FAD to produce fumarate and FADH <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.13">However, in the reaction assayed, FAD was replaced by an artificial electron acceptor, INT. This is a tetrazolium derivative which changes from a colourless compound into a red fromazan when reduced. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.13">INT is particularly useful in this case as it serves as a means to assay the enzyme quantitatively by spectrophotometry. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.2;p3.13">Succinate dehydrogenase is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.13">Thus the obvious hypothesis established was that enzyme activity will be greatest in the mitochondrial fraction. </s>

<head>Results:</head>

<s n="s1.7;p6.13">As expected, the fraction O contains all organelles that were observed in the other fractions. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.13">The nuclear fraction contained nuclei and clusters of small units. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.13">These are probably cell debris and smaller organelles found in cells. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.13">The M fraction had distinctly visible mitochondria and was quite free of other material, apart from some small clusters as found in fraction N. No large organelles were observed in the supernatant. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.13">As mentioned, in several of the fractions, large units were found. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.13">Possibly these are the many vesicles that can be found in hepatocytes. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.13">Hepatocytes are very active cells that synthesise cholesterol and bile, which are stored in secretory vesicles until expelled from the cell by exocytosis. </s>

<p n="p7.13">
<s n="s1.3;p7.13">Upon determination of protein content of each fraction, it was observed that fraction S and N contained the most protein, but values were all around 20%. (see graph 1.) </s>

<head>Conclusion:</head>
<p n="p9.13">
<s n="s1.2;p9.13">All fractions were fairly pure, as determined from the observation under the phase contrast microscope. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.13">However, there were several components that were unidentified, speculated to be secretory vesicles and other small organelles found in hepatocytes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.13">
<s n="s1.3;p10.13">As mentioned, the three fractions had approximately the same amount of protein content, although the supernatant contained the most. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.13">Possibly during the homogenation of the cells, broken particles and proteins settled in the supernatant fraction. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.13">Indeed, the cytosol itself contains many enzymes and various other proteins. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.13">
<s n="s1.5;p11.13">However, according to the results obtained, the supernatant fraction did not contain any succinate dehydrogenase. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.13">In contrast, the nuclear fraction did contain the enzyme, although about half the amount found in the mitochondrial fraction. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.13">This suggests some contamination. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.13">Possibly the mitochondria lysed and some of its enzymes became incorporated into the other fractions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.13">Given the numerous procedures involved in this experiment, it was difficult to avoid contamination and minor errors that carried over to the next step in the procedure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.13">
<s n="s1.3;p12.13">Nevertheless, judging by percentage recovery (appendix p. 5) the amounts obtained were fairly adequate, with 72.4% recovery of protein and 102.6% of enzyme. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.13">The percentage of enzyme recovered was over 100%, and indicates the presence of other molecules that could have possibly acted as activators of succinate dehydrogenase. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.13">Perhaps the molecules were among the cell debris and unidentified organelles observed in the fractions under the phase contrast microscope. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.13">
<s n="s1.2;p13.13">The specific activity of the enzyme was highest in the mitochondria as remarked earlier, and secondly the nuclear fraction. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.13">This final result supports the original hypothesis that the mitochondrial fraction should have the highest specific activity of succinate dehydrogenase. </s>
