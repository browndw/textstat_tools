<p n="p1.18">
<s n="s1.2;p1.18">Lord Denning is regarded as having been one of the most radical members of the English judiciary, as shown by his enthusiasm to employ the judicial power of legislating in his decision-making, where he saw fit. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.18">Known as "the people's judge", Denning is considered one of the most popular adjudicators, with Lord Woolf praising his "...<hi rend="italic">extraordinary ability in his judgements to reflect the sense of justice of the public at large..."</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.001"/>, and yet is also one of the most heavily criticised for his susceptibility to reach thoroughly unconventional decisions that created only short-lived precedent. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">

</note>
<p n="p2.18">
<s n="s1.4;p2.18">When looking at certain Property Law cases that came before Denning, we can see how the liberal approach he adopted made his decision-making seem sympathetic to persons in residential occupation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.18">Such tendencies led him to some radical and controversial decisions, criticised by his peers for their propensity to potentially 'clog' titles of residential property by creating an excessive number of interests which would lead to impracticalities and insecurities in conveyancing transactions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.18">In the following paragraphs, I will endeavour to evaluate the impact such decisions had on the rights of those in residential occupation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.18">In order to do this, we must first establish what the traditional legal positions were in relation to determining those rights, before investigating how Denning's decisions revised the positions, and concluding whether they had a lasting impact on them. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">(i) Contractual Licences </head>
<p n="p3.18">
<s n="s1.13;p3.18">A fundamental issue that Denning dealt with in relation to contractual licences was whether or not such a right to occupation could become an interest in land and thus bind third parties. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p3.18">The established legal position was that a contractual licence was not an interest in land as it is revocable<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.002"/>, merely bestowing a <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> and not a <hi rend="italic">proprietary</hi> right on the licensee and therefore does not bind third parties. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p3.18">Authority for this rule can be found at case law. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p3.18">In <hi rend="italic">King v.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.13;p3.18">
<hi rend="italic">David Allen &amp; Sons, Billposting Ltd</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.003"/>, King and Allen entered a contractual agreement which gave the latter a licence to display posters on the walls of a cinema owned by King, who later leased the cinema to a third party. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p3.18">They demanded that Allen should discontinue displaying the posters. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p3.18">The House of Lords regarded the contract as creating nothing more than a personal obligation, bestowing rights capable of binding only on those party to it. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p3.18">It was not an interest in land that would have otherwise bound the new lessee to Allen's right to occupation. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p3.18">In <hi rend="italic">Clore v.</hi> </s>
<s rend="italic" n="s10.13;p3.18">Theatrical Properties Ltd. </s>

<s n="s11.13;p3.18">, the court held that the contractual agreement which gave Clore "exclusive use of all the refreshment rooms of a theatre" was merely a licence rather than a lease. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p3.18">Consequently, it was held that contractual licences were not capable of binding a third party, even with notice, thus furthering the rule established in <hi rend="italic">King v.</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.9;p4.18">However, Lord Denning's reasoning in the case of <hi rend="italic">Errington v.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.18">
<hi rend="italic">Errington and Woods</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.005"/> initiated the development of a controversial theory, which suggested that a contractual licence could in fact be '<hi rend="italic">elevated to the status of a proprietary right'</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.006"/>, despite the established precedent to the contrary. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.18">In this case, an agreement was made whereby a father promised to convey his house to his son and daughter-in-law, who lived in it, provided the couple paid all the mortgage instalments. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.18">When the father died, his widow inherited the house and sought possession against the couple, who had indeed paid the instalments in accordance with their agreement. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.18">In holding that the couple should maintain their right to occupation, Denning reached an unconventional decision. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.18">The <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> for this was that equity had stepped in to ensure the couple's contractual license could not be revoked, as they had acted upon their agreement to their detriment. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.18">This equity, Denning argued, had <hi rend="italic">'fused'</hi> with the law so as to give them an equitable interest in land that thus bound the widow seeking possession; essentially: "<hi rend="italic">The infusion of equity means that contractual licences now have a force and validity of their own</hi>" that can only be disregarded by a <hi rend="italic">"purchaser without notice"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.18">Denning's decision had thus created a new interest in land, seemingly going against both precedent and s.4(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 which attempts to restrict such expansionary decision-making for the benefit of facilitating the conveyance of land. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.18">It therefore also seemed to contradict the fundamental principle that licences are thus classified "<hi rend="italic">precisely as they do not qualify as other recognised interests in the land, such as leases and easements</hi>

<s n="s1.10;p5.18">Disapproval of Denning's decision seems abundant, yet despite such criticism, his argument that contractual licences could create interests in land persisted for some years, being upheld, although reluctantly, in the cases of <hi rend="italic"> Re Sharpe</hi>

<s n="s4.10;p5.18">Evans<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.18">Here, Mrs. Evans entered into an agreement with Tredegar Estates allowing her to continue to live rent free in a cottage, owned by the Estate, for the rest of her life, provided she simply maintained the house and garden to a good degree. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p5.18">Binions purchased the cottage from the Estate at a reduced price and, crucially, under express conditions that recognised Evans' right of occupation, and later attempted to seek possession against her. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p5.18">The action failed; the majority in the Court of Appeal decided that Evans was a tenant for life by virtue of her agreement with the Estate, which they felt had given her life interest in the property. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p5.18">Because Binions had evidently taken notice of this, he was bound to her interest. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.18">However, in adopting the rationale he developed in Errington<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.012"/> and by emphasising the significance of upholding the "true intent of the parties<ref target="BAWE_0069b-ftnote.013"/>" which seemingly were not to give Evans the significant statutory powers given to her as a tenant for life, Denning argued that Evans' agreement should be construed as an irrevocable contractual licence, thus giving her an equitable interest in the land. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p5.18">This licence, he argued, should be protected by the imposition of a constructive trust as Binions had expressly agreed to allow Evans' right upon purchase; therefore it would have been inequitable to later deny her this. </s>
