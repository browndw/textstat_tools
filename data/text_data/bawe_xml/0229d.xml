<p n="p1.23">
<s n="s1.5;p1.23">The whole of Oscar Wilde's writing, like the man himself, is a contradiction. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.23">John Sloan, calls England Wilde's 'mother country'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.001"/>, and his society plays are set in the upper class echelons of England, supporting the general public's view that he was a born Englishman. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.23">And yet, Wilde spent much of his life in homage to that well-known Anglo-Irish villain, Count Dracula. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.23">Like the Count, whose knowledge of English geography surpasses that of his English guest's<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.002"/>, Wilde was able to be 'more English than the English themselves'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.003"/> due to his position as an outsider, an Irishman who said himself that he was 'not English', but 'Irish which is quite another thing'.<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.004"/> Not only did he classify himself as Irish, but also his work; as Sloan states, 'In artistic matters, Wilde consistently identified himself with a new 'Celtic School' of literature'.<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.005"/> Hence, there is clearly a paradoxical discussion occurring in the criticism concerned with Wilde's nationality, implying that an appreciation of his work and his themes cannot ignore the 'Irish Question'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.006"/> of the man himself and the influence that his schizophrenic cultural background had on his writing. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.23">In investigating this influence, I will examine to what extent Wilde approaches Ireland, whether directly or obliquely, in the following essay. </s>

<p n="p2.23">
<s n="s1.20;p2.23">It is not surprising that Wilde is considered to be one of the greatest <hi rend="italic">English</hi> authors of all time. </s>
<s n="s2.20;p2.23">His transformation into a dandy at Oxford, along with his promotion as a typical English aristocrat by the tourist industry, have helped to sustain this myth. </s>
<s n="s3.20;p2.23">Moreover, there are only two direct references to Wilde's country of birth in <hi rend="underlined">The Works of Oscar Wilde</hi> (this does not include lectures or letters). </s>
<s n="s4.20;p2.23">Mrs Cheveley, in <hi rend="underlined">An Ideal Husband</hi>, briefly mentions her desire to 'teach the English to talk, and the Irish to listen'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.007"/>, and the narrator of <hi rend="underlined">A Portrait of Mr. W. H.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.20;p2.23">tells the reader that he has been discussing 'Macpherson, Ireland, and Chatterton'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.008"/> of late. </s>
<s n="s6.20;p2.23">Yet many critics have recognised that, despite the lack of direct references to Wilde's native country, Ireland is a dominant albeit subtle theme throughout Wilde's work. </s>
<s n="s7.20;p2.23">This is most apparent in Wilde's indirect treatment of Anglo-Irish relations. </s>
<s n="s8.20;p2.23">The Great Famine took place just before Wilde was born<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.009"/>, engraving the image of his suffering fellow countrymen on the family conscience; indeed, his father wrote a report on the 'devastating effect of starvation and mass immigration'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.010"/> on Ireland. </s>
<s n="s9.20;p2.23">It was the 'English insular unawareness of the realities of Irish life'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.011"/> which proved fatal during the Famine Years, and was frequently the catalyst in Wilde's work and life to convince him to assume the 'pose of an Englishman', 'a clever strategy for challenging English prejudices about the Irish'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.20;p2.23">However, in some writings, Wilde used no such pose and focused on specifically Irish themes, which one critic has described as 'anarchy and socialism, poverty and privilege, feminism and gender [and] imperialism'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s11.20;p2.23">The theme of 'poverty' is especially apparent in the abundance of famine imagery throughout his work. </s>
<s n="s12.20;p2.23">Sloan mentions only one portrayal of famine in Wilde's work, saying that 'The terrifying vision of the famine in 'The Young King'... is seen to allude to Ireland during the Great Hunger'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s13.20;p2.23">However, there are several other veiled references to this key event in Irish history. </s>
<s n="s14.20;p2.23">As Brecht's <hi rend="underlined">The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui</hi> attacks contemporary German politics, thinly disguised by moving the action to America, so is Mother Russia in <hi rend="underlined">Vera</hi> 'a barely suppressed political correlative for Mother Ireland'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.20;p2.23">Indeed, in revolutionary literature, the country for whose fight for freedom on is documenting is often referred to as 'Mother' (witness Brecht, again, in his poem, <hi rend="underlined">Deutschland</hi>), and nowhere is this more true than in <hi rend="underlined">Vera</hi>. </s>
<s n="s16.20;p2.23">Michael, one of the Nihilist revolutionaries, says, in a <hi rend="underlined">Hamlet</hi>-esque metaphor, that 'there is one who lies sick [he] would fain cure', depicting the invalid as 'Mother Russia'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s17.20;p2.23">Russia is once again referred to as 'mother'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.017"/> on the next page, and Alexis, the Czar's son, symbolically rejects his royal status for socialism in saying, 'I have no mother now but Russia'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.018"/>. </s>
<s n="s18.20;p2.23">Nonetheless, the implied image of Ireland as the sacrificial, selfless, mother reaches its peak when Vera apostrophises Russia twice within a few lines, exclaiming, 'O crucified mother'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.019"/>. </s>
<s n="s19.20;p2.23">In equating Ireland with Christ's crucifixion, Wilde elevates his native country's history, suggesting that future generations will prosper due to past sacrifices. </s>
<s n="s20.20;p2.23">This is supported by O' Donoghue's view that 'sacrifice as an idea pervades the Irish cultural tradition'<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.020"/>. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p6.23">Paradoxically, relieving Sir Simon of his chains (that is, Ireland of her total slavery to England in matters of government), which are symbolic of his prison term as a ghost, only makes him more a slave than ever, which is reminiscent of the phrase from <hi rend="underlined">The Young King</hi>, where the slaves are in 'chains, though no eye beholds them'.<ref target="BAWE_0229d-ftnote.036"/> Like Sir Simon, Ireland could only look to England for her release from her 'prison term'. </s>

The United States Minister was naturally a little annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. "I have no wish," he said, to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him.... Upon the other hand," he continued, "he continued, "if he really declines to use the Rising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him.
