<s n="s1.2;p18.51">Although the bracketing method found the solution after 22 iterations, some may argue that 22 iterations is too much and takes too long, however the advantage of using the bracketing method is that if the root of the function being investigated is within the starting interval, a correct solution will always be found. </s>
