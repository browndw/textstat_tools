<s n="s1.9;p1.36">Ongoing research in the Severn Estuary has been investigating the interaction of Mesolithic people with their environment. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.36">The project has been particularly interested in the identification of human agency and other disturbance factors, at a time when sea-level rise was producing a constantly changing environment (Bell <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.36">2004). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.36">Work at the site of Goldcliff East (Fig. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.36">1) has been particularly useful due to the amount and quality of environmental evidence preserved under peat and estuarine silt (Bell <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.36">2003; Bell <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.36">2004). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.36">The micromorphological work at this site, undertaken by Virgil Yendell, has focused on the evolution of the buried land surface at Goldcliff in respect to climatic change and the interplay of these factors with human lifeways in the Mesolithic (Yendell 2004). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.36">This project utilises one sample from Goldcliff Site B, slide 5525, to address questions about site formation and human activity, post-depositional processes, and the use of micromorphology on sites of this kind. </s>

<p n="p2.36">
<s n="s1.7;p2.36">The application of micromorphology to archaeological soils and sediments has been steadily increasing in the UK in recent years (French 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.36">Early examples of its use in the study of palaeosols are Westward Ho! </s>

<s n="s4.7;p2.36">1987) and Brean Down (Bell 1990), while micromorphology undertaken at the Experimental Earthworks at Overton Down and Wareham has increased our understanding of site formation processes and the effects of burial on soils (Bell <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.36">1996). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.36">However, there are still those who doubt whether micromorphological analysis contributes significantly to the understanding of a site or landscape on an archaeological timescale to warrant the time and expense of undertaking thin section analysis (French 2003). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.36">A further question to be investigated in this report, therefore, is whether the study of soil thin-sections from Goldcliff contributes significant information that was not available from other archaeological techniques. </s>

<p n="p3.36">
<s n="s1.6;p3.36">Archaeologists have also been debating the nature of settlement and land-use in the Neolithic in the last decade. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.36">This has been prompted in particular by the discovery of microscopic charcoal at numerous Mesolithic sites in England and Scotland (Simmons &amp; Innes 1996; Edwards 1990; Dark 2004), leading to suggestions that Mesolithic people deliberately burnt woodland and reed swamps to enhance the plant resources available and draw herbivores to the site (Simmons 1996). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.36">The extent and nature of this burning is not yet clear, however. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.36">These questions also relate to a wider issue of environmental reconstruction. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.36">There are concerns in the archaeological community about the spatial resolution of pollen studies and the difficulties in discriminating between natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Bell &amp; Walker 2005:183-6), and a growing recognition that Holocene woodland vegetation may have been much more patchy than has often been assumed (Vera 1997). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.36">The importance of understanding how humans interacted with environmental change cannot be overstated, and micromorphology may present a useful approach in dealing with this question. </s>

<head rend="italic">1.2 Research aims and objectives</head>
<p n="p4.36">
<s n="s1.2;p4.36">There were three main objectives for the micromorphological work at Goldcliff East. </s>

<list type="bulleted">
<item>Understanding the formation and evolution of the old land surface at various stages of climatic change</item>
<item>Investigation of the presence of any buried soils at the old land surface</item>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.36">
<s n="s1.1;p6.36">What is the nature of the sediments comprising the old land surface, and what processes led to their formation and deposition? </s>

<p n="p10.36">
<s n="s1.5;p10.36">The area at Goldcliff called Site B (Fig. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p10.36">2003), and a further excavation was undertaken in 2003 by Martin Bell in association with 'Time Team', all as part of the ongoing research of the Severn Estuary Levels Research Committee (Bell <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.36">2004). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.36">Site B was re-excavated because in 2001 and 2002 Mesolithic artefacts and substantial environmental evidence had been recovered, and the erosion of the site was happening at a rapid rate. </s>

<p n="p11.36">
<s n="s1.4;p11.36">Due to the short tidal window available for archaeological work (2 hours 40 minutes exposure at spring tides, none at neap tide), a block-lifting methodology was adopted. </s>

<p n="p13.36">
<s n="s1.8;p13.36">The thin sections were prepared according to Murphy (1986). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p13.36">Due to the waterlogged nature of the estuarine sediments, the acetone replacement method (Murphy 1985) was utilised to prevent shrinkage of the sediment blocks. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p13.36">The samples were then impregnated with resin, cured in an oven and the slides prepared to a standard thickness of 30μm. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p13.36">The surfaces were consolidated using Araldite 2020. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p13.36">Although the slide preparation was generally successful, there are several areas on slide 5525 (Fig. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p13.36">4) where coarse grains have been dislodged or removed during sample preparation. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p13.36">The slide has also been ground slightly too thin, causing the birefringence colours, particularly of quartz, to appear darker (J.R.L. Allen, <hi rend="italic">pers.comm</hi>.). </s>

<p n="p15.36">
<s n="s1.3;p15.36">Slide 5525 contains one main context from Site B, context 321, which is the original land surface, and whose characteristics are described below (Table 1). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.36">At the top of the slide, incipient peat formation can be observed (context 319). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.36">The boundary to this context is diffuse, and represented only by an increase in organic matter from 5% to 10% in the upper 2 cm of the slide. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.36">
<s n="s1.4;p16.36">The sediment of context 321 is a sandy clay loam to sandy clay, with a coarse/fine ratio of between 20:80 and 30:70. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.36">The coarse fraction consists primarily of medium to fine quartz sand, both single crystals and quartz aggregate (70:30), with some flint and small amounts of plagioclase, microcline, biotite and olivine also present. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.36">The fine fraction is fine silt and clay in approximately 50:50 ratio. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.36">The overall colour is pale brown to grey in plane-polarised light (PPL), and under cross-polarised light (XPL) the b-fabric is crystallitic speckled with grey and white 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> order birefringence, resulting mainly from the quartzite nature of the fine-grained silt, and shows some grano-striation of clays. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.36">
<s n="s1.4;p17.36">The microstructure is primarily massive, with the grains closely embedded in the fine material, with a few channel and chamber voids. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.36">The sediment is poorly sorted with particles of all sizes represented. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.36">There is no orientation pattern in the sediment, and no obvious distribution pattern, apart from the organic material which tends to be concentrated in patches and lenses in the upper third of the slide (visible as areas with slightly darker brown colouring in PPL). </s>

<div3>
<head rend="italic">3.2.1 Formation processes</head>
<p n="p21.36">
<s n="s1.5;p21.36">The sediment is a poorly sorted sandy clay loam with very limited channel and chamber voids, many of which contain clay linings. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.36">The presence of clay laminations within the massive sediment suggests that the structure was once more open. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.36">Charred and waterlogged organic material is present in significant amounts, particularly in the upper third of the slide forming the diffuse boundary to the reed peat above. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.36">These features suggest that incipient pedogenesis may have occurred in this sediment. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.36">Yendell (2004) suggests that there is a palaeosol preserved at Site B at Goldcliff East, but the compression and post-depositional alteration of the sediments appears to have destroyed any evidence of peds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.36">
<s n="s1.4;p22.36">The sand component of the sediment may result from the underlying parent material, which is Ipswichian beach sand/gravel and head deposits (Bell <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.36">2004). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.36">The finer material may have been brought in by fluvial processes, and mixed with the underlying sands and some organic material. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.36">This mechanism would explain the poor sorting of the sediment and the sub-rounded shape of the coarse grains. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="italic">3.2.2 Organic remains</head>
<p n="p23.36">
<s n="s1.5;p23.36">The plant remains, though not well-preserved, display a generally fibrous structure with no annual banding. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p23.36">Therefore, it is likely that most of the organic matter comes from reeds and grasses growing at the edge of the estuary. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p23.36">This interpretation is supported by the presence of reed peat directly above this deposit (Fig. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p23.36">5). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p23.36">Although none of the phytoliths could be identified, their presence also suggests grassy vegetation, as trees do not tend to produce phytoliths (Rapp &amp; Hill 2006: 173). </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.36">
<s n="s1.2;p24.36">The diatoms found in the slide suggest a marine environment, which is not surprising given the location of the site. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.36">Their association with the water-logged organic matter suggests that they may have come on to the site attached to reeds rather than being splashed or swept onto the site by the tide. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="italic">3.2.3 Post-depositional processes</head>
<p n="p25.36">
<s n="s1.6;p25.36">Several different post-depositional processes have acted on this sediment. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p25.36">The channels appear to be polyphasic, with organic material in some channels, clay laminations lining these and later channels with silt inwash. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p25.36">Where these separate channel fills occur together (Fig. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p25.36">8), it appears that the silt-filled channel penetrates through the clay and organic material. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p25.36">This suggests that roots and burrowing organisms have followed previous channels as a path of least resistance into the sediment. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p25.36">The repeated nature of the burrowing suggests that the sediment has been subjected to significant bioturbation, which may be obscuring the original character of the sediment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.36">
<s n="s1.8;p26.36">Pyrite is prevalent in the slide. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p26.36">This mineral forms in reducing conditions in marine environments in the presence of sulphates. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p26.36">In some cases, the pyrite partially or completely replaces organic matter. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p26.36">The reducing conditions imply that the pyrite formed when the site was waterlogged and peat formation had begun. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p26.36">Subsequently, a limited amount of gypsum has formed. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p26.36">Gypsum is a calcium sulphate which is usually found in arid soils, but can also form through the oxidation of pyrite reacting with calcium carbonate (Miedemaal. 1974). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p26.36">Although glauconite, another iron compound, is present in the sediment, the lack of intergrowth and rounded shape of the crystals suggests that it is likely to be detrital sediment rather than a post-depositional formation. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p26.36">Apart from the iron compounds discussed, the sediment itself is relatively depleted in iron content, except in the boundary to the overlying peat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.36">
<s n="s1.1;p27.36">Finally, the diffuse nature of the boundary to the peat above this unit, evidenced both here and other areas of the site, suggests that there may have been trampling across the site by people or animals. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p28.36">The sediments identified in this slide suggest that at Goldcliff East Site B, a soil may have begun to develop in the early Holocene on the underlying Ipswichian sand and head deposits. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p28.36">This soil formation is seen from the presence of organic matter and clay movement through the sediment, and may have exhibited more pore structure before compression by overlying sediments. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p28.36">The pale colour also suggests that there is low iron content resulting from mobilisation of the iron and redeposition as pyrite. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p28.36">The sediment appears to have been compressed with little evidence of soil structure remaining. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p28.36">Yendell suggests that the palaeosol can be classified as a saline gley (Yendell 2004), similar to that found at Westward Ho!, Devon, with its weakly developed soil characteristics, massive structure and root channels with organic and silty infill (Balaam <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.6;p28.36">1987). </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.36">
<s n="s1.3;p29.36">The numerous episodes of channel formation by roots and burrowing organisms may originate during the period when the site was still vegetated before marine transgression occurred. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p29.36">Once the site was waterlogged by rising sea-levels, the conditions became reducing and pyrite formation occurred. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p29.36">At a later stage, some of this pyrite was oxidised to gypsum, but it is not possible to determine when this occurred. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.36">
<s n="s1.4;p30.36">The only evidence for human activity at the site from this slide comes from the presence of charred plant material in higher quantities than at other parts of Goldcliff East (Yendell 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.36">Although charcoal can occur naturally, elevated levels in an estuarine environment suggest some human activity, either from small fires at occupation sites for cooking or warmth, or more general burning of reeds and woodland. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.36">Such burning has also been identified at other sites, such as Star Carr (Dark 2004), and may have been intended to encourage new growth of food plants or grazing for herbivores. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.36">The trampling of the upper boundary of the land surface may also represent human activity, but could also result from animal trampling - footprints of humans and animals have been found at Goldcliff East Sites C and E (Scales 2003). </s>

<head rend="bold italic">5. Evaluation</head>
<p n="p31.36">
<s n="s1.2;p31.36">This study has been able to draw some conclusions about the nature and origin of the sediments at Site B at Goldcliff East, and the interaction of humans with environmental change at an estuarine site. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.36">In particular: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p32.36">
<s n="s1.1;p32.36">The land surface was found to be a sandy clay with soil development occurring. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p33.36">
<s n="s1.1;p33.36">There is little direct evidence for human activity from this slide, but charred material suggests possible anthropogenic burning of the reed swamp. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p34.36">
<s n="s1.1;p34.36">Numerous post-depositional processes have acted on the sediments, including burrowing roots from vegetations, burrowing organisms and waterlogging of the site as a result of rising sea-level in the Holocene. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.36">
<s n="s1.3;p35.36">The study of this site using thin-section micromorphology has enabled a very detailed understanding of the sedimentary history of the site, which would be difficult to fully understand without this technique. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p35.36">Although analytical techniques can be used to characterise the particle size and organic content of a sediment, it is only when viewing the sediments in thin section that the relationships of the various components to each other can be properly identified. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p35.36">In addition, the complex post-depositional history of this sediment makes micromorphology the best approach for interpreting the sequence of events correctly. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">6. Future research</head>
<p n="p36.36">
<s n="s1.8;p36.36">Although palaeosols have been identified at Goldcliff East, both in this section and in other areas, the exact mechanism of soil development has not yet been fully established (Yendell 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p36.36">Further study should be undertaken to determine when and how this soil may have formed, as micromorphological techniques are not able to date these layers to a specific period. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p36.36">Radiocarbon dating of the organic material should assist understanding of the formation of the palaeosol. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p36.36">Additionally, the order in which the post-depositional disturbance occurred should be confirmed. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p36.36">There are also questions about the presence of glauconite in the sediment, which may be detrital or could have weathered from the pyrite. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p36.36">The iron distribution and exact composition of the iron minerals could be determined using electron microprobe analysis (Courty <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.8;p36.36">1989: 51-2). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p36.36">This work will further our understanding of the environmental history of the Severn Estuary and its relationship to human activity and changing climate through time. </s>
