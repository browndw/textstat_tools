</docTitle>
<epigraph>
<p>George is a lay member of an Employment Tribunal. He regularly hears cases on a panel with Fiona the Tribunal's chair. Fiona is a lawyer with specialist knowledge of accidents at work and a member of a firm of consultants that advises construction companies on Health and Safety issues. The third member of the Tribunal is Geoffrey, a member of a trade union and employed in the construction industry. Gareth is a claimant alleging that he was unfairly dismissed by The Construction Company Ltd., (fictitious) on the grounds that he could have prevented an accident after a worker fell off some unsafe scaffolding and that he was negligent in undertaking the risk assessment for the company. The Tribunal ruled against Gareth who unsuccessfully appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Gareth wishes to apply for judicial review on the grounds that the Tribunal was biased. It emerges that (a) George is married to Gareth's second cousin, but has never met Gareth and did not know of this relationship; (b) Fiona's company advised the Construction Company Ltd on Health and Safety matters and (c) Geoffrey is a member of the same golf club as George and Gareth but has not met Gareth. However, Geoffrey's wife is a close friend of Gareth's aunt and they meet regularly at a health club owned by Gareth's trade union and organise social events for all their neighbours. Advise Gareth as to the law on bias as a ground for review.</p>

<s n="s1.4;p25.30">George is married to the appellant's second cousin, but has never met him and does not even know of his relationship. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.30">The question is whether this family relationship may be sufficient to support an allegation of bias and which role his non-knowledge plays in this context. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.30">An arbitrator should certainly not hear a case involving a member of his family. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p26.30">In addition to this, a preferential treatment of such far family members seems to be very escapist. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.30">Although there is no need to show whether he was conscious or not of this fact in Geoffrey's case it is important to mention this circumstance. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p26.30">It has been argued that the subjective element is of importance as an arbitrator who is not even aware of his relationship cannot favour the party, or one of the parties, intentionally. </s>

<head>Conclusion</head>
<p n="p27.30">
<s n="s1.2;p27.30">The exclusion of judges who appear to be involved in some way with one of the parties or to be biased in any other way does 'protect the integrity of the decision-making process'<ref target="BAWE_0196a-ftnote.022"/> and strengthens confidence in our legal system. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.30">It is of foremost importance that this rule is abided by and that no exceptions may be made. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p28.30">Danger faces this awareness of bias solely if it is turned into a means to exclude judges that are disagreeable to one of the parties. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.30">The danger mentioned above lies in a widening of this ground to appeal more to the social background. </s>
