<head>1.0 Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.22">
<s n="s1.3;p1.22">The field work was carried out in March 2005 at Friog Quarry, nearby to Fairbourne in Wales by JE Engineering Ltd. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.22">The investigation was carried out on the understanding that the site is desired to be converted into an area of public access that can be used for leisure activities such as walking, climbing and diving. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.22">The aim of the investigation was to determine whether the area is suitable for such activities in terms of the stability of the quarry faces. </s>

<head>1.1 Scope of the Report</head>
<p n="p2.22">
<s n="s1.4;p2.22">This report presents the results of fieldwork comprising the dip direction of each of the quarry faces and a discontinuity survey including the dip readings of the cracks and bedding planes found on each face. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.22">The measurements were taken by means of a compass - clinometer. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.22">These readings can be used to determine the stability of the quarry faces and hence whether the site can be used for its suggested purposes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.22">The results also allow for a risk assessment to be carried out which helps in deciding what safety measures, if any, need to be put into place. </s>

<head>2.0 The Site</head>
<div2>
<head>2.1 Location</head>
<p n="p3.22">
<s n="s1.7;p3.22">Friog Quarry is around 1km South-East of Fairbourne. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.22">Access by road is from the A493 towards Fairbourne and then taking a right next a small amount of cottages, where limited car parking can be found. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.22">From this minor road the only way to the site is by means of path that is around 400m along the track. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.22">The path is steep and unstable and is unsuitable for almost all vehicles as it is very rough and the terrain is uneven. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.22">The National Grid Reference is SH620121. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.22">The site is situated approximately 120m above sea level. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.22">The location of the site can be found on figs 1 and 2. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>2.2 Description</head>
<p n="p4.22">
<s n="s1.2;p4.22">The road up to the site is very unstable, has many large cracks and has clearly receded over the years. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.22">Due to the abundance of precipitation in the area, the ground conditions are also very unsafe with uneven rocks providing the majority, particularly on entering the quarry through the tunnel. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.22">
<s n="s1.2;p5.22">The quarry can be modelled as a rectangle for simplicity, with the four sides, A,B,C and D, bounding a small lake in the centre which is 16 metres deep. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.22">The lake holds hazardous implications as it is very cold all year round and there is only point of exit should someone be in the lake. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.22">
<s n="s1.1;p6.22">There are several disused buildings from when the quarry was operational. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.22">
<s n="s1.2;p7.22">There are small amounts of vegetation comprising trees and bushes at the top of faces A and C but the majority of the site is covered with scrap slate. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.22">The path is very hazardous at the top of face A as sections at the top have crumbled away due to army training activities and a diversion path has been made away from the edge but this is quite unclear. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.22">
<s n="s1.2;p8.22">Face A has a dip direction of 220° from north and a dip of 89° towards the lake. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.22">The face initially appears to be fairly safe with evidence of a limited amount of creep and toppling at the top, also there appears to be some wedge failure in the corner joining faces A and B. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.22">
<s n="s1.7;p9.22">Face B seems quite unstable due to the large amounts of scree that are present at the bottom of the face. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.22">From observation it seems as though there are toppling, plane and wedge failures throughout the face. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.22">The face has a dip direction of 310° and a dip of 75°. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.22">Face C shows a little evidence to suggest toppling failure but aside from that seems fairly stable. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.22">There is a dip direction of 20° and a dip of 76°. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.22">Face D shows a very limited amount of evidence that some minor failures are beginning to occur but seems very stable. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.22">The face has a dip direction of 115° and a dip of 78°. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p18.22">Proper paths need to be installed around the area because the abundance of slate and loose rocks makes the negotiation of the existing walkways very hazardous. </s>

<p n="p19.22">
<s n="s1.3;p19.22">This is particularly the case on the route down to the underground mine and it may be necessary to install steps with proper handrails. </s>

<p n="p20.22">
<s n="s1.4;p20.22">It is also imperative that the unstable slopes be made more stable, there are several measures that could be implemented to achieve this. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p20.22">Retaining structures could be put in place to counter act the forces that are causing the instability, such structures are piles and anchors. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.22">A drainage system could be implemented to reduce the water that is allowed to build up in the cracks which decreases strength. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.22">
<s n="s1.1;p21.22">Fences should be erected around the edges of the quarry to stop anyone from falling over the edge. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p22.22">The underground tunnels house many open mine shafts. </s>
