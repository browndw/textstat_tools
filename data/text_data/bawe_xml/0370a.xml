<s n="s3.8;p49.52">However, food prices have a coefficient not corresponding to intuition because it shows a negative relationship. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p49.52">What we have here is that price of food has gone down in the same period as poverty has reduced as well. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p49.52">A possible explanation is government policies targeting the price of food, subsidies to control prices, low-cost imports, more efficient agriculture.. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p49.52">As food is less expensive people can afford more of it and have money to buy intermediate goods as well. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p49.52">On the other hand, the proportion of people who are net producers, not consumers of food will suffer because their income is reduced. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p49.52">This result might imply a sum of these effects, which in this sample ended up as negative although not statistically significantly different from zero. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p50.52">The aim of the paper was to see if trade is significant or not in explaining reductions in poverty. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p50.52">This was not the case with China and now it has been confirmed for India as well. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p50.52">The recent years especially have seen a great increase in trade share but this has not been met by decreased poverty. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p50.52">It remains to be seen if the effect takes longer to realise, as our observation period is quite short it cannot be fully verified. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p50.52">This also causes small sample problems when OLS is only consistent under very specific assumptions. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p50.52">The quantitative results are therefore not very predictive but they correspond to theory with respect to coefficient signs implying that the signals from the data are interpreted correctly. </s>

<p n="p51.52">
<s n="s1.6;p51.52">What could be included in this study is a more thorough analysis of the model and the co-integrating relationships between the variables which remains unclear. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p51.52">Inflation is generally an I(2) variable but also trade here demonstrates similar effects. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p51.52">As the estimation of a mixed model containing I(2) and I(1) variables is out of the scope of this study, but could be done in an extended piece of research. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p51.52">Also relevant would be to refine the model to actually capture the variables that affect poverty in India, as shown the same variables that worked with China were not significant here and include some dummies to correct for breaks. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p51.52">This requires investigation of the economic, political and social conditions during the time period to understand the variables in question. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p51.52">This has been attempted in several studies but as in the developing world in general, specific sources of poverty are difficult to pin down. </s>

<p n="p52.52">
<s n="s1.6;p52.52">The policy implications of this study are not straightforward because as Ravallion states, trade volume is not a policy variable<ref target="BAWE_0370a-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p52.52">It is also not certain whether it is endogenous to the model. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p52.52">What we can say is that by showing that trade volume does not explain changes in poverty it means that gains from trade are filtered to the higher income levels. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p52.52">This implies a case for increased redistribution, government might need to be more bullish in taxing the profits gained by companies from increased trade to alleviate the increased inequality observed in other papers as well. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p52.52">At the same time, if the price of food is kept artificially low through government intervention it can harm the domestic producers. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p52.52">This study has confirmed once again that there is no clear cut Pareto efficient way out of poverty. </s>
