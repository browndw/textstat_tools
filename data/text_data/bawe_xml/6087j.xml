<head rend="underlined">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p12.27">
<s n="s1.3;p12.27">Mince meat provides an environment of relatively high water activity, near neutral pH and plenty of nutrients. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.27">These conditions would favour the growth of bacteria which can; multiply at relatively quick rate and, move around with the use of their flagella. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.27">Maintaining an environment of low temperature, by storing the meat in a refrigerator, would slow the rate at which the bacteria can multiply. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.27">
<s n="s1.3;p13.27">From the results obtained it is clear that the raw meat contained an inappropriate level of contamination. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.27">The general viable count calculated, (table 2), is 1 x 10 <hi rend="sup">9</hi> cfu/ ml which is much higher than the acceptable level of contamination set at &lt; 5 x 10 <hi rend="sup">5</hi>/ g. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.27">The counts for faecal enteroccoci, enterbacteriacae and <hi rend="italic">Staphyloccocus aureus</hi> were also higher than the acceptable levels of contamination for these specific microbes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.27">
<s n="s1.2;p14.27">The number of pathogens present is so high this mince meat would be potentially harmful to consume, even after undergoing heat treatment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.27">It is likely the meat has been stored incorrectly, for example left at ambient temperatures, giving the microbes an opportunity to multiply. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.27">
<s n="s1.4;p15.27">If the counts for faecal enteroccoci, enterbacteriacae and <hi rend="italic">Staphyloccocus aureus</hi> were added together the total number of microbes present would be higher than the general viable count. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.27">(9.7 x 10 <hi rend="sup">3</hi> + 5.1 x 10 <hi rend="sup">3</hi> + 8.4 x 10 <hi rend="sup">4</hi> is greater than 1 x 10 <hi rend="sup">9</hi>) This suggests that there is a degree of error in this procedure, which may have occurred due to the sampling techniques. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.27">The meat sample was particularly difficult to pipette because some larger (fat) particles became stuck in the pipette. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.27">While making the dilutions and inoculating the media the sample taken may not have been representative of the whole sample. </s>

<div2>
<head>i) </head>
<p n="p16.27">
<s n="s1.2;p16.27">It is acceptable for fresh meat to have a level of contamination of up to 50 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria/g and 100 <hi rend="italic">Staphyloccocus aureus</hi>/g. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.27">Cooked meats should have less than 10/g of each of these bacteria. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.27">
<s n="s1.2;p17.27">The source of the initial contamination from meat can either be from the internal microflora of the animal itself or the environment it is initially exposed to when slaughtered. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.27">The acceptable level of contamination reflects the fact that fresh meat will have a certain level of contamination from either (or both) of these sources. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.27">
<s n="s1.2;p18.27">During processing the meat will undergo heat treatment which will kill bacteria and bring the contamination level down to a point at which it can be consumed without carrying any risk of causing illness. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.27">This is why the acceptable level of contamination is lower in fully cooked meat products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.27">
<s n="s1.2;p19.27">Post-processing contamination of the meat would occur if the cooked product came into contact with a surface containing unacceptably high levels of contamination. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.27">This could be a surface that has been in contact with fresh meat and would infect the cooked product with potentially harmful levels of bacteria. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.27">
<s n="s1.4;p20.27">The storage conditions of meat are fundamental in keeping the numbers of microbes to a minimum. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.27">If kept refrigerated at 5˚C the microorganisms' rate of multiplication, in fresh and cooked meat, is minimal, and will not be able to multiply to potentially harmful levels. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.27">In cooked meats heat- resistant bacterial spores can survive processing. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.27">Therefore, appropriate storage conditions should be maintained even when the bacterial count is low. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.27">
<s n="s1.1;p21.27">The counting method used does not give an exact number of microbes present so the processed and raw meats are given a range on which to access their acceptability. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>ii) </head>
<p n="p22.27">
<s n="s1.3;p22.27">It is acceptable for fresh meat to have a level of contamination of up to 50 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria/g and 100 <hi rend="italic">Staphyloccocus aureus</hi>/g. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.27">Cream cakes should not contain detectable numbers of these bacteria. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.27">This is because fresh meat will be cooked before consumption killing the bacteria present whereas cream cakes will not undergo any further heat treatment so should not have any detection of these microbes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.27">
<s n="s1.3;p23.27">The source and nature of the initial contamination of cream cakes is the bacteria in the cream itself. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.27">These bacterium exist naturally in relatively low levels as the milk comes into contact with the environment on exiting the cow's udder. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.27">The milk, and cream which is separated from it, should be kept chilled and processed soon after milking to prevent multiplication of the bacteria. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.27">
<s n="s1.2;p24.27">During processing the cream will be heated to pasteurisation temperatures. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.27">This kills bacteria and brings the contamination level down to low enough levels that, if stored at chilled temperatures; such low numbers of bacteria will exist that multiplication will be very slow. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.3;p25.27">The cream should be packed in aseptic conditions to prevent post-processing contamination. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.27">If post-processing contamination did occur the amount of bacteria in the cream would pose a risk to the consumer. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.27">When the packaging which separates cream from the environment is opened the cream is in contact with bacteria in the environment and should be stored at refrigerated temperatures and consumed before the bacteria have an opportunity to multiply. </s>

<p n="p26.27">
<s n="s1.2;p26.27">The multiple tube dilution method is an appropriate method for enumerating coliform bacteria and <hi rend="italic">E.Coli</hi> because they ferment lactose while they are multiplying to produce a gas. </s>
