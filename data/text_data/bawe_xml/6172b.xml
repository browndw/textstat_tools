<s n="s1.2;p7.16">The two data sets derived from the theoretical and empirical formulae generally show a good correspondence to the measured data. </s>

<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.3;p8.16">To determine which of the formulae represented the best approximation to the measured values, the measured value of SVP was subtracted from the corresponding value given by the theoretical and empirical formulae. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p11.16">It is possible to derive another formula to calculate SVP (see Appendix 1). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.16">As with the theoretical formula previously discussed, the new formula is derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.16">However, whereas the theoretical formula assumes that L (the latent heat of condensation of water) is constant, the new derivation accounts for the fact that L varies with temperature. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.16">Therefore a relationship must be established between T and L. Figure 3 illustrates this relationship, assuming L is a linear function of temperature. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p12.16">Of particular interest is the value of the gradient (-0.0024 J kg <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> K <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>), which approximates the rate of change of L with temperature. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.16">This value may be used in the new Clausius-Clapeyron equation for SVP. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.16">
<s n="s1.4;p13.16">The Clausius-Clapeyron SVP values were calculated using this value, and the difference from the measured values was determined by the same process used to generate figure 2. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.16">These results were compared with those for the empirical formula, currently the best approximation available to the measured values. </s>

<p n="p14.16">
<s n="s1.2;p14.16">Figure 4 indicates that accounting for the variation in L with temperature has little effect on improving the accuracy of the theoretical SVP derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">4. Conclusions</head>
<p n="p15.16">
<s n="s1.2;p15.16">The empirical method for deriving SVP has been shown to correspond better to measured values of SVP than the formulae derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation across the entire temperature range. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.16">This is not surprising since, as its name suggests, the empirical formula has been derived from empirical (observed) data. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.7;p16.16">The inaccuracies of the Clausius-Clapeyron based formulae lie in their mathematical handling of the latent heat of condensation of water (L). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p16.16">The theoretical formula assumes L to be constant across the range of temperatures considered (dL/dT = 0). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p16.16">As figure 3 demonstrates, this is not the case. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p16.16">However, even when dL/dT ≠ 0 is accounted for by a refined Clausius-Clapeyron derivation of SVP, the approximation is still relatively poor (figure 4). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p16.16">It is possible that this results from oversimplifying the relationship between L and T by assuming it to be linear. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p16.16">Improved approximations may be achieved by better defining this relationship, at the cost of a more complex formula defining SVP for a given temperature. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p16.16">There appears to be little practical use for such a formula, given the accuracy of the empirical version. </s>
