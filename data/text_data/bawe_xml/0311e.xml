<p>Using a NaI(Tl) scintillator and photomultiplier for converting gamma radiation into electrical pulses, a multichannel analyser was determined to be linear and used to detect unknown sources of γ-ray radiation. γ-ray radiation was found to obey the Poisson distribution. An accurate spectrum of <hi rend="sup">137</hi>Cs was fully explained. The mass attenuation coefficient of lead was calculated to be 0.014 <hi rend="italic">m2 kg-1</hi> for lead, but is considered unreliable due to bad geometry.</p>

<s n="s1.4;p120.124">The aim to measure the γ-ray attenuation of lead was successful, although the error was not calculated. </s>
