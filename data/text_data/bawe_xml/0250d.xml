<p n="p1.78">
<s n="s1.3;p1.78">The purpose of this report is to investigate the performance characteristics (e.g. efficiency and input power) of a centrifugal pump running at 2000 and 3000 RPM. Using a pump test rig provided by PLINT ltd, various operating conditions are tested, and the corresponding output behaviour is recorded. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.78">The data is expressed by performance curves, which indicate the most favourable operating conditions of the pump. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.78">By performing a dimensional analysis, various non-dimensional groups can be devised to provide a representation of the relationship between the performance characteristics. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.78">
<s n="s1.3;p2.78">The experiment proves that the centrifugal pump used, has an optimal efficiency of 48% when operated at approximately 3000 RPM. The generation of pump performance curves provides an indication of the amount of head which must be overcome in order for the pump to operate at a particular flow. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.78">These curves also indicate the ideal operating conditions for the pump, and also the range of conditions in which the pump can be operated within safely, without causing any damage to the machinery. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.78">It is evident that the pump should be run at approximately 3000 RPM at a discharge of no greater than 1.8 litres/sec, in order to achieve optimal performance. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p74.78">The centrifugal pump used in the experiment has a peak efficiency of 48% when running at ~3000 RPM. It is most suited to this speed, as it can be operated at a greater variety of operating conditions without adding excessive strain on the pump components. </s>
</p>
<p n="p75.78">
<s n="s1.1;p75.78">The input power required by the impeller follows an approximately linear relationship with the flow discharge. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p76.78">There are numerous errors associated with the results from the experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p76.78">These errors originate from the measured quantities, such as delivery/suction pressure and the manometer readings. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p76.78">The errors are more severe at the greater speed, due to unstable flow. </s>
</p>
<p n="p77.78">
<s n="s1.1;p77.78">The graphs of the performance characteristics provide an indication of the amount of head which must be overcome for the pump to run at a specific flow discharge. </s>
</p>
<p n="p78.78">
<s n="s1.2;p78.78">By performing dimensional analysis on the experimental parameters, a number of expressions have been constructed to provide a relationship between these parameters. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p78.78">Graphical analysis of the non-dimensional groups confirms the validity of these expressions. </s>
