<s n="s4.9;p4.16">While the creation of these routes was important for industry, a secondary objective was to counter famine problems by allowing the movement of any surplus food to impoverished areas. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.16">Irrigation too was constructed with the idea of providing water outside of the rainy season. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.16">As with railways, the uptake of irrigation was quite spectacular: 'by World War two, over 32 million acres...was irrigated from state irrigation schemes, the largest in any country in the world." </s>

<s n="s7.9;p4.16">Despite this philanthropic nature of these schemes, the British were harshly criticized over the provision of revenue for development. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p5.16">The agriculture industry was also modernised by the British, with positive and negative outcomes. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p5.16">The introduction of large scale cash crops such as cotton, jute, indigo and tea allowed India greater scope for export and therefore competition in the world's markets. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p5.16">Such a transformation obviously could not happen overnight, but the foundations were certainly laid. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p5.16">However, with agricultural reform came the addition of land tax. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.16">All land needed to be officially owned by a person and this tax could only be paid in currency.<ref target="BAWE_0030a-ftnote.010"/> The result was the destruction of previous tribal work ethics, where often several people shared and worked the land together. </s>

<s n="s1.16;p8.16">Perhaps the most controversial measure was that of the tribute tax. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p8.16">The payment of the tribute or 'home charge' was seen as the primary drain on the Indian economy. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p8.16">This included paying pensions and salaries of the administrators of India. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p8.16">The government felt it inappropriate to charge the British tax payer and subsequently billed any related expense to the colony. </s>

<s n="s6.16;p8.16">If this money had gone to Indians then at least it would have stayed in the Indian economy, but as it was paid to expatriate Britons, the money left the country. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p8.16">Revenue not spent on India was either used in public work schemes or paid to the shareholders of the East Indian Company, who collected a 10.5 per cent dividend. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p8.16">Even when the company ceased trading in 1834, this dividend still had to be paid. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p8.16">The Indians obviously could not afford this tax so a loan was created. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p8.16">This loan, however, still had to be serviced with interest payments. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p8.16">The East Indian Company surrendered its rights to the Crown who, despite the huge Indian debt, paid absolutely nothing for it. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p8.16">Whenever the tribute could not cover the cost of any expenditure, the amount was simply added to the loan. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p8.16">This obviously had a snowballing effect, with increased debt leading to increased interest payments. </s>
