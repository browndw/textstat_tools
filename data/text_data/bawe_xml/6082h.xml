<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.1;p4.24">According to the report and Table 1, my diet is generally low in <hi rend="italic">energy</hi> (832kcals less than recommended), which is only about 57% of the DRV; also low in <hi rend="italic">calcium</hi>, with 177mg less than DRV; <hi rend="italic">potassium</hi>, 1150mg less, 66% of recommended amount consumed; Iron, 4.1mg less than DRV.

<s n="s1.6;p5.24">Being living in UK, a more developed country, people are often nourished. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p5.24">Surprisingly, I have a double vitamin C intake than recommended. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.24">'Taking 1000 mg or less of vitamin C a day is unlikely to cause any harm' (Food Standards Agency). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.24">However, prolonged diet high in sodium (salt) - 20% more is consumed then recommended - increases the risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and stroke, which I need to beware of. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.24">
<s n="s1.1;p9.24">Add fresh herbs, black pepper, garlic, ginger and lime which give more flavour </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.24">
<s n="s1.1;p10.24">Make sauces with ripe ingredients e.g. tomatoes and garlic, again to bring a stronger flavour </s>

<head rend="italic">Advantages</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.24">
<s n="s1.1;p12.24">A very suitable dietary survey method assessing individuals. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.24">
<s n="s1.2;p13.24">Few sources of error than past intake e.g. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.24">FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) since it does not rely on memory; no error in portion size </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.24">
<s n="s1.1;p14.24">Cheap and easy to carry out - in terms of equipment, only an electronic scale and the food database are needed. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.24">
<s n="s1.1;p15.24">Relatively quick method comparing to some other dietary survey methods, which usually take more than six days. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="italic">Limitations of Methodology</head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.24">
<s n="s1.1;p16.24">"Diet histories of this type are fraught with interpretation difficulties" (Bingham, 1985 and 1987) </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p17.24">
<s n="s1.2;p17.24">Patience and care required for proper data entry i.e. it is rather tedious to have to enter the data for every food that consumed in six days. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.24">High degree of cooperation of the subject is needed. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.24">
<s n="s1.2;p18.24">Data on some food items not available in the database, my own interpretation is required to select the nearest food material. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.24">E.g. chocolate drink is chosen as there is no cereal drink available. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.24">
<s n="s1.2;p19.24">My high salt intake could be due to no option for boiling some kinds of vegetables in <hi rend="italic">unsalted</hi> water, and "boiled with <hi rend="italic">salted</hi> water" is the only choice. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.24">Selecting the wrong or different item can make a big difference to the final data. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p20.24">
<s n="s1.1;p20.24">The weighing scale has a low accuracy to only about 5g, salt and sugar intake or other small dietary additions e.g. a small clover of garlic are not being able to weigh </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p21.24">
<s n="s1.3;p21.24">Weighing is not always possible due to embarrassment caused especially in public areas, simply as having a meal in the restaurant. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.24">Estimations have to be made. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.24">Therefore the reliability and accuracy of the survey will be affected. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p22.24">
<s n="s1.2;p22.24">Biases caused - reported diet may not reflect the actual diet as subjects choose not to have certain food types to avoid the difficulties in weighing every ingredient of the item. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.24">E.g. sandwich with a mixture of fillings. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p23.24">
<s n="s1.1;p23.24">Heavily dependent on food composition table used to estimate nutrient intake that are likely to contain errors. </s>

</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p24.24">
<s n="s1.3;p24.24">Any measurement of diet will be biased in some way by the measurement process itself, so in practice, there is no entirely objective measures of an individual's food consumption. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.24">Since the Foodbase report processed has determined my intake of energy and other nutrients by the 6-day weighed dietary survey, the aim of the experiment has been reached. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.24">This again emphasises the importance of a balanced diet. </s>
