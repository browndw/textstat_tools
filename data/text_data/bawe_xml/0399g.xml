<s n="s5.8;p4.19">This argument has been documented throughout literature writing on the MAFF and is especially apparent in its behaviour in the BSE crisis which appeared in the late 1980's. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.19">Complete removal of the disease required the slaughtering of all livestock and the de-contamination of all cow feed- a project which would cost a reported 20 billion at current prices. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p7.19">Reports have highlighted the way in which this flawed structure enabled the vilification of scientific conclusions advocating the need for governmental precautionary action.<ref target="BAWE_0399g-ftnote.009"/> Furthermore, regulatory flaws meant that decisions about the scope of risk assessments i.e which kind of effects deem as risks and which to exclude or discount, and about the trade offs between risks and benefits were frequently taken within scientific committees and often misrepresented as purely scientific. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p7.19">Regulatory gaps even stretched as far as to allow, in some cases, scientific committees to be set up so that they produced outcomes favouring particular policies; as one MAFF official acknowledged "you have to turn to external bodies to try to give some credibility to public pronouncements, [but] you are very dependent therefore on what the Committees then find... </s>

<s n="s1.7;p17.19">It is claimed that the separation of food standards and safety responsibilities to the FSA has been one of the main institutional reforms in food policy at UK national level in recent years.<ref target="BAWE_0399g-ftnote.030"/> However, the reforms that have been laid in place are still under much scrutiny. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.19">While some think that the reforms are radical, others think the reforms are not radical enough; The FSA is charged with protecting and informing the consumer. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.19">But its remit clearly excludes key dimensions of modern consumerism such as environmental or ethical considerations in food. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.19">Yet all down the food supply chain demands informed by such considerations are now extremely influential in the marketplace. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.19">According to Tim Lang, "It might be worth considering giving the FSA a broader role. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.19">The Danes, after all, first created their agency in response to environmental food concerns, then gave it a public health role, and then added the food safety dimension. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p19.19">Clearly, the FSA was created at a time of real need; however, if it is to win consumer trust 100 percent, it must continue to operate in this sphere of transparency. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.19">It may also need to consider widening its domain of operation by taking a broader, more secondary set of concerns into consideration. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.19">What is apparent is that the FSA has made a successful attempt at separating itself from producer pressures, and creating a more direct link to Government. </s>
