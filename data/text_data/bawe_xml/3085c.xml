<s n="s3.7;p5.37">This accolade made a huge change to Glasgow. </s>

</p>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Strengths</head>
<p n="p15.37">
<s n="s1.6;p15.37">Marriott Liverpool City Centre Hotel is owned by a listed company called Whitbread plc and its mother company is Marriott International Inc., which is a leading worldwide hospitality company. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.37">Thus, it has a well-known brand name. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.37">Marriott started operating since 1927, it has rich experience and knowledge in providing excellent services to its customers so that it was always given lots of awards (Marriott International Inc., 2004). </s>

</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Weaknesses</head>
<p n="p16.37">
<s n="s1.3;p16.37">During the field trip in Liverpool, we had a talk which is held in the Marriott Liverpool City Centre Hotel. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.37">At that time, I found that this hotel is a little bit out of my expectation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.37">There are three weaknesses including the human resources, the physical appearance and the capacity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.37">
<s n="s1.2;p17.37">Firstly, in terms of the human resources, it is not difficult to find that the hotel is lack of staff. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.37">In such a big brand hotel, it is unreasonable to see that only several staff in the lobby. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.37">
<s n="s1.2;p18.37">In regarding to the physical appearance, Marriott Liverpool City Centre Hotel is famous of focusing on their layout design, furnishment, decoration and even the uniform design. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.37">However, it gave us the impression of old-fashioned. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.37">
<s n="s1.2;p19.37">On the aspect of capacity, Marriott Liverpool City Centre is really small in the capacity since it has only 146 rooms (The Mersey Partnership, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.37">This amount is totally unable to accommodate the extra tourists during 2008. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Opportunities</head>
<p n="p20.37">
<s n="s1.4;p20.37">Basically, the major opportunity for the Marriott Liverpool City Centre is the event of European Capital of Culture. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.37">As a winning city, the authorities of Liverpool have to rebuild its image to get rid of the negative picture. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.37">The regeneration of the city can make it more attractive in order to create a centre of attention to the tourists. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.37">As a consequence, it can attract many travelers visiting Liverpool and hence the demand for the hotels will be increased obviously at that time. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Threats</head>
<p n="p21.37">
<s n="s1.7;p21.37">As estimated, the "08 project" can attract an extra 1.7 million tourists to Liverpool (Liverpool 08, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p21.37">However, according to the Mersey partnership (2004), it recorded that the sum of rooms offered by all kinds of hotels is not able to cover extra guests if the situation remain unchanged in the near future. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p21.37">According to the Mersey Partnership (2004), the supply of hotels in Liverpool city centre increased significantly in 2002 and 2003 with the opening of 4 new budget hotels, adding a further 448 budget hotel bedrooms in the city centre (representing a 19% increase in total hotel supply, and an 83% increase in budget hotel supply). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p21.37">As at November 2003, the total city centre hotel supply now stands at 26 hotels and 2,754 bedrooms, accounting for 40.5% of the total Merseyside hotel supply [Appendix 1]. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold"> Porter's Five Forces</head>
<p n="p23.37">
<s n="s1.2;p23.37">According to Go &amp; Pine (1994), they mentioned that the Porter's Five Forces model is used to gain an insight into the evolving structure of the Liverpool hotel industry. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.37">It is comprised of the following five forces: </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">The Threat of New Entrants</head>
<p n="p24.37">
<s n="s1.3;p24.37">The threat of new entrants to an industry are mainly depends on the barriers to entry and the reaction to new entrants, and the core barriers to entry in the hotel industry are economics of scale; product differentiation; capital requirement and location (Go &amp; Pine, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.37">However, since the authorities must build up more and more amounts of hotels in order to cater the enormous demand of the extra tourists, these factors are not the critical elements for the potential investors to be considered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.37">Thus, the threat of new entrants is high. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">The Bargaining Power of Buyers</head>
<p n="p25.37">
<s n="s1.5;p25.37">The bargaining power of buyers is high because of the three elements. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.37">The development of technology that enables that enables individual travelers to reserve hotels themselves anytime anywhere in the world. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.37">(Olsen, West &amp; Tse, 1998) cited in (Kim &amp; Oh, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.37">Customers can force hotels to lower prices with higher quality and better services (Kim &amp; Oh, 2003). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.37">Buyers can always find alternative hotel option and have knowledge to play one hotel firm against another (Go &amp; Pine, 1994). </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">The Threat of Substitute Products</head>
<p n="p26.37">
<s n="s1.6;p26.37">The third major competitive force is pressure from substitute products. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p26.37">As in the era of technology, the travel is becoming easier and faster. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p26.37">Thus, the convenient of transportation make possible to schedule one-day round-trip flights to their destination instead of staying overnight. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.37">On the other hand, there is a wide range of accommodation substitutes with the potential to replace the stay in the hotel industry such as resort time shares, recreational vehicles and camping grounds etc. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p26.37">(Go &amp; Pine, 2004). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p26.37">Thus, the threat of substitute products is high. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">The Bargaining Power of Suppliers</head>
<p n="p27.37">
<s n="s1.2;p27.37">As Go &amp; Pine (2004) stated, suppliers to an industry can drive down profitability by raising prices or reducing the quality of goods sold to the industry. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.37">Suppliers can exert their bargaining power over hotel companies by threatening to raise prices, limit availability of resources, or reduce the quality of resources (Porter, 1980) cited in (Kim &amp; Oh, 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.37">
<s n="s1.2;p28.37">Moreover, Labour is another source of bargaining power of supplier as not many people would like to work in the lodging industry. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.37">The lodging manpower report (Hiemstra 1988) concludes that it seems anomalous that the labour shortage exists while unemployment prevails (Go &amp; Pine, (1994). </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.37">
<s n="s1.1;p29.37">Actually, the bargaining power of supplier is not high. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Industry Competition</head>
<p n="p30.37">
<s n="s1.3;p30.37">Undoubtedly, since more new entrants are going into the industry, the industry competition will be stiffer. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.37">Apart from the increase in the competitors, the rivalry's strategy will be another factor influence the competition. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.37">Generally, the competition is likely to be high. </s>

</div3>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold"> PEST analysis </head>
<p n="p31.37">
<s n="s1.2;p31.37">It is inevitable that the more prosperity the tourism industry is, the more cost the destination needs to be bore. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.37">As say by the United Nations of Environment Program, sustainability has three interconnected aspects: environmental, socio-cultural, and economic. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Environmental</head>
<p n="p32.37">
<s n="s1.3;p32.37">The negative impacts of tourism development can gradually destroy the environmental resources on which it depends. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.37">However, on the other hand, tourism has the potential to create beneficial effects on the environment by contributing to environmental protection and conservation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.37">It is a way to raise awareness of environmental values and it can serve as a tool to finance protection of natural areas and increase their economic importance (UNEPb, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.37">
<s n="s1.3;p33.37">In this perspective, Marriott Liverpool City Centre has done well since they mentioned in their annual report that they are taking the responsibility on the environmental concern. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.37">They concentrate on the way how they use the resources. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.37">They plan to manage those resources as efficiently as possible. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Socio-culture</head>
<p n="p34.37">
<s n="s1.5;p34.37">Tourism can generate positive impacts as it can serve as a supportive force for peace, foster pride in cultural traditions and help avoid urban relocation by creating local jobs. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p34.37">As often happens when different cultures meet, socio-cultural impacts are ambiguous: the same objectively described impacts are seen as beneficial by some groups, and are perceived as negative - or as having negative aspects - by other stakeholders (UNEPc, 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p34.37">Because of the designation of the European Capital of City, there are surely more tourists from all over the world, especially from the European Union, come to visit the place. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p34.37">This may lead to a clash like different languages and different cultures. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p34.37">Due to this reason, Marriott has to manage carefully on providing training and indicator for its staff in order to deal with the problem easily. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Economic</head>
<p n="p35.37">
<s n="s1.4;p35.37">According to the UNEP (2004), it pointed out that the main positive economic impacts of tourism relate to foreign exchange earnings, contributions to government revenues, and generation of employment and business opportunities. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p35.37">It is the similar case as in Liverpool, economically being the European Capital of Culture means an increase in tourism, boosting local business and creating more jobs. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p35.37">Liverpool can enjoy benefits from attracting more tourists visiting Liverpool as they can bring lots of opportunities to the place. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p35.37">As one of the sector in the tourism industry, Marriott Liverpool City Centre Hotel can also share the benefits from the European Capital of Culture during 2008. </s>
</p>
</div3>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold"> Conclusion</head>
<p n="p36.37">
<s n="s1.1;p36.37">As one of the Stakeholders/businesses in the Liverpool tourism industry, and possessing strong resources and capability, Marriott Liverpool City Centre must utilise its strengths and opportunities provided by the European Capital of City 2008 to gain the competitive advantage among its competitors and hence to minimise the negative impacts appear in the industry. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.37">
<s n="s1.2;p37.37">Besides enjoying the benefits the designation offer, it is a must for Marriott Liverpool City Centre Hotel to bear the responsibility on the sustainability. </s>
