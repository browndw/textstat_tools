<s n="s2.4;p1.12">' Considering historians (debatably) conclude that between twenty-five and fifty per cent of Eurasia was purged by the Great Plague and its cyclical recurrence thereafter, it is satisfactory to consider the Black Death as the worst epidemic in the known history of mankind. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.12">Even so, one of the greatest difficulties when delving into accounts on the Black Death is our limited knowledge of medieval demography, with records appearing too scattered and haphazard to make a definitive statement. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.12">As previously considered, the history of the Black Death is a 'child of the scientific understanding of the disease,'<ref target="BAWE_0044a-ftnote.002"/> and so the perspective of the bacteriologist has varied considerably throughout past eras. </s>

<s n="s6.6;p2.12">Shrewsbury denies that the plague was a widespread epidemic when compared to the influenza outbreak of 1918-1919, stating, 'It seems extremely probable that several distinct diseases were epidemic in different parts of England during the years from 1360 to 1362 inclusive,'<ref target="BAWE_0044a-ftnote.003"/> and although Colin Platt admits that famine, and not disease, was still the principal causation of death after 1349, Shrewsbury's theories must be disapproved. </s>

<s n="s2.9;p3.12">W. Bean states that Shrewsbury's insistence of the bubonic plague being a mainly urban phenomenon is incorrect, the impact spreading to predominately pastoral areas such as the boarders of Wales. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.12">Although areas such as Bohemia and the Low Countries failed to be affected by the 'Plague', there is no proof that the Y. Pestis decimated one third of the entire population of the British Isles and the rest of Europe alike. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.12">Therefore this sudden depopulation of society had a massive cultural and economic impact upon society as a whole, through both immediate and longer-term, protracted factors. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.12">Of course, when I state 'long-term' I do so liberally, considering that the Black Death itself is an extensive incident spanning nearly four hundred years in total. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.12">The historian Robert Gottfried examines such consequences in great detail, concluding with the vast, sweeping statement that, '<hi rend="italic">Depopulation ended the manorial system, at least in the West</hi>." </s>

<s n="s7.9;p3.12">Gottfried's <hi rend="italic">The Black Death</hi> considers that '<hi rend="italic">w√ºstungen</hi>'<ref target="BAWE_0044a-ftnote.005"/> created economic prosperity for the workers and consequent urbanisation of English society; due to the Black Death 1300 villages had been deserted between 1350 and 1500. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.12">The manorial system ceased to succeed, in his opinion, partly due to now "absentee" landlords collecting <hi rend="italic">rentiers</hi>, and also due to the indiscriminate nature of the disease destroying both ecclesiastical bureaucrats and the remaining British serfs alike. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.12">This does support Colin Platt's statement that landowners withdrew from farming upon the land, becoming "<hi rend="italic">a responsible country gentry</hi>," or absentee, creating what appears to be the beginning of that "parliamentary society" of wealth and verse that became so problematic in the eighteenth century. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p4.12">In her studies, in the manors of the Bishop of Winchester, commutation was rare preceding the plague outbreak of 1348, and that little changed after this date. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.12">However, as studies of different regions tend to suggest, areas such as the manor of Whitney reveal an opposing conclusions. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.12">Historians can therefore assume that in some areas of England there was a sharp rise in commutations while some landlords could restore the original <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of their manorial structure. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.12">Either way, historians must still account for the impact upon some particular regions being a vast deviation from the norm prior to the Black Death, although perhaps not as much as originally supposed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.5;p5.12">However, what many historians (such as Gottfried) main economic proposal for the enormity of the Black Death rests upon is the relationship between English tenant and landowner. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.12">Phillip Ziegler writes, <hi rend="italic">'"The immediate effect of the plague", wrote Rogers, "was to double the wages of labour; in some districts to raise the rate even beyond this."</hi>'<ref target="BAWE_0044a-ftnote.006"/> Ziegler develops the argument of the medievalist Thorold Rogers, who maintains that the Black Death caused the long-term resentment of the serfs, which gives rise to the Peasant's Revolt of 1381. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.12">If this is strictly the case, then the consequences of the Black Death itself were created a '<hi rend="italic">ripple effect</hi>', eventually resulting in more suitable taxation and a more stable bureaucratic apparatus. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.12">Initially, there can be little doubt that the Black Death was responsible for a rise in wages due to the greater bargaining position of tenants given the sudden labour shortage. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.12">Gottfried states that '<hi rend="italic">at Cuxham Manor in England, a ploughman who was paid 2 shillings a week in 1347 received 7 shillings in 1349.'</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0044a-ftnote.007"/> This friction between the more envious position of the <hi rend="italic">villein</hi> and the landowner's belligerent effort to limit wage rises (resulting in <hi rend="italic">The Statute of Labourers</hi> in 1351) presented a reason for conflict that erupted through the poll tax. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p6.12">This argument is paramount in presenting the Black Death as a fundamental catalyst for economic alterations within the very fabric of society. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.12">However, Ziegler maintains that the economy was already in decline twenty-five years <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the outbreak of the Black Death, when agricultural production and trade had been steadily waning. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.12">Secondly, unless the comparison is between the first 'Great Plague' of 1348-1350, more than one epidemic must be considered, resulting in a more complex historical conclusion when including the <hi rend="italic">pestis secundus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pestis tertis</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.12">Finally, Ziegler considers that the impact of the Black Death had been somewhat undermined by the severe overpopulation before its outbreak, and the population in England was greater than the land could provide for. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p7.12">The conclusion of Roger's original statement is therefore less definitive than originally supposed. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p7.12">Colin Platt states that although changing fashions in religion were a cause of declining recruitment within the ecclesiastical society, 'very few religious houses in late-medieval Britain ever fully recovered from their pre-plague numbers, and this was true of such huge and well-endowed communities as Christ Church (Canterbury)." </s>

<s n="s8.8;p7.12">To many, including myself, this hardly appears as an exaggeration, and even though a culmination of factors invariably caused the reformation around Europe, the secularisation and depopulation associated with the Black Death must claim a large proportion of the responsibility. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p8.12">Gottfried writes, 'close to 20% of the parish priests in certain deaneries fled the Black Death,'<ref target="BAWE_0044a-ftnote.010"/> and it is hardly surprising that roots of anticlericalism <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have become lodged here. </s>
