<s n="s1.2;p2.30">Gel electrophoresis and western blotting are the two techniques focused upon in the experiment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.30">Gel electrophoresis resolves individual proteins by the use of an electric current separating them by molecular weight and charge whereas western blotting transfers these proteins from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane to enable protein identification. </s>

<p n="p3.30">
<s n="s1.4;p3.30">The plate apparatus is cleaned, constructed and tested for water tightness. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.30">The gel is then prepared from many substances such as acrylamide solution, methylene-bis acrylamide is added to ensure uniform cross links form throughout the gel. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.30">Altering the concentration of the acrylamide alters the resolving power of the proteins affecting the size of the proteins identified. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.30">High concentrations of acrylamide will form more cross links leading to a small pore size and effective resolving of small proteins only. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p4.30">In this experiment a discontinuous buffer system which concentrates the protein sample prior to its run on the resolving gel. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.30">Upon application of the electric current, glycinate ions from the upper reservoir enter the stacking gel and migrate towards the anode but at a slower rate than chloride ions from HCl in the stacking gel. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.30">Once glycinate ions enter the stacking gel they become protonated zwitterions due to the difference in pH. This reduces their mobility increasing the distance between the glycinate and chloride ions. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.30">A high voltage gradient is produced between the two ion fronts causing proteins and glycinate ions to be accelerate causing protein concentration to increase. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.30">The proteins then migrate in the resolving gel and are separated according to their molecular weight and charge. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p7.30">The filter can then be washed with streptavidin-peroxidase which has a high affinity for biotin and enables the protein of interest to be stained. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p14.30">From using figure 3, the three polypeptides have molecular weights of approximately 69.2KDa, 42.7KDa and 27.5KDa respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.30">The GST protein was found to have a molecular weight of 10.96KDa. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.30">
<s n="s1.3;p15.30">The protein of molecular weight 69.2KDa may be the NusA protein from the <hi rend="italic">nusA</hi> gene which is required for elongation of mRNA and therefore would be present in large amounts as transcription of the GST protein is very high. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.30">The protein of molecular weight 27.5KDa may be a C-terminal truncated peptide of glutathione-S-transferase/PTP-1B. The proteins these molecular weights represent may not be accurate as further information such as their sequence is not available. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.30">The conclusion as to the type of proteins these three unknown polypeptides may represent is based on that transcription would be occurring at high levels in the cell system and GST proteins are also present. </s>

<p n="p16.30">
<s n="s1.3;p16.30">Over expression of foreign genes in <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> can lead to problems. </s>

</p>
<p n="p17.30">
<s n="s1.7;p17.30">If the gene is eukaroytic specific problems can arise due to the different regulatory properties which prokaryotic and eukaroytic cells possess. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.30">For example prokaryotic mRNA is often polycistronic which eukaroytic mRNA rarely is. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.30">Eukaroytic mRNA will contain introns and may require post translational processes which the prokaryotic cell may be unable to perform effectively. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.30">Eukaryotes and prokaryotes also use different transcription and translation promoter sequences. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.30">Transcription in prokaryotes requires two promotes at -10 and -35, TATAAT and TTGACA respectively. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.30">These differ from the eukaroytic promoters which are at -25 and -75, TATAAA and CAAT respectively. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p17.30">Unless the eukaroytic gene is altered in the promoter region, prokaryotic transcription mechanisms will not be able to recognise the gene and may begin transcription before or after the start codon of the gene or may not recognise and sequence at all leading to the gene not being transcribed. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p18.30">Protein A-biotin/streptavidin can be used instead of a secondary antibody although the outcome is the same. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.30">An antibody specific for the protein of interest is washed over a nitrocellulose membrane. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.30">Biotinylated protein A is then added and binds to the antibody but not al the antigenic site. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.30">Streptavidin-peroxidase is then bound to the biotinylated protein A due to its high affinity for binding biotin. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p18.30">The streptavidin peroxidase acts on 4-chloro-1-napthol using hydrogen peroxide as a catalyst staining the protein of interest or antigen-antibody-protein A-biotin-streptavidin peroxidase complex a blue/purple colour. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p19.30">Monoclonal antibodies are generated in a natural immune response or after immunization in the laboratory and are a mixture of molecules of different specificities and affinities. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.30">Spleen cells from an immunized mouse are fused with mouse myeloma cells. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.30">These divide and secrete the specific antigen used to immunize the spleen cell. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.30">However, human immune systems often rejected the mouse antibodies so a new technique pioneered by CAT involved 'phage display'. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.30">In this technique, bacteriophage are manipulated to display human monoclonal antibodies on their surface enabling billions of human safe antibodies to be created for screening. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p20.30">Polyclonal antibodies are produced when a mouse is immunised against a diverse range of antigens. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.30">Large numbers of different B-cells are stimulated producing different antibodies. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.30">Sometimes these antibodies recognise or cross react with similar sequences in other proteins so the antibody which was raised against antigen A, for example can also recognise antigen B. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.30">
<s n="s1.5;p21.30">To modify the gel system in SDS-PAGE to increase the resolution of the polypeptides in the protein sample the concentration of acrylamide can be altered. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.30">In this experiment the resolving gel contained 15% acrylamide. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.30">If this concentration was increased, more cross links could occur between the molecules of acrylamide decreasing the pore size effectively only enabling small polypeptides to pass through. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.30">If the concentration of acrylamide was decreased fewer cross links would form increasing the pore size enabling larger proteins to be resolved more effectively. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.30">Therefore decreasing acrylamide concentrations enables lower molecular weight proteins to be resolved. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p25.30">Non specific binding of antibody is where an antibody may bind elsewhere other then the protein of interest on the nitrocellulose filter. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p25.30">This occurs because the antibodies recognise a sequence of amino acids which may be present in other proteins on the filter. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p25.30">In order to determine which component is causing the non-specific antibody binding, a nitrocellulose filter should be made eliminating each antibody in turn. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p25.30">For example, in this experiments case a primary and secondary antibody along with streptavidin-peroxidase were used. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p25.30">Nitrocellulose filters would be constructed eliminating each one in them and observing its effect on the non specific binding. </s>
