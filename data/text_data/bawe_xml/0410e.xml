<s n="s1.6;p15.15">As we have seen, it is fair to that although the current position in England and Europe excludes the choice of a non-state body of law, non-state laws are given effect through various alternate mechanisms. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.15">Our balancing exercise was weighed against this background and we found that although there are certain obstacles that are in the path of outright acceptance, the justifications for infringement of the freedom of choice are considerably diminished when we consider the arguments in the business context. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.15">We identified obstacles such as difficulty in identifying the precise content of non-state norms and the possibility of infringing public policy. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.15">Although legal pluralism argument loses strength after close scrutiny, democratic legitimacy is not required in the commercial context. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.15">However, allowing parties to choose a commercial code that is neutral, internationally recognized and capable of being uniformly applied worldwide (such as the UNIDROIT Principles) would nevertheless avoid unnecessary conflicts and boost the impact of the parties' will. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p15.15">This view is supported by the change of attitudes in Europe and America.<ref target="BAWE_0410e-ftnote.037"/> Hence, neutral and internationally recognized non-state commercial codifications that are capable of being uniformly applied worldwide should be available as an option in choice of law rules. </s>
