</p>
<p n="p8.52">
<s n="s1.2;p8.52">If the component is large then ensuring the centre of the component cools at a rate below the CCR is difficult due to the surfaced layers insulating the bulk of the material from the quenching medium. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.52">To over come these problems alloying elements are added to the steel, common alloying elements are: Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), Tungsten (W), Vanadium (V), Cobalt (Co), Silicon (Si), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), Aluminium (Al), Titanium (Ti) and Niobium (Nb). </s>

<p n="p45.52">
<s n="s1.1;p45.52">The results show that the two steel samples acquired much higher Vickers hardness values after the heat treatment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.52">
<s n="s1.4;p46.52">Graph 1 shows the test results for the 070M55 steel, this has a high hardness value towards the water quenched end, but this hardness value falls quickly as the distance from the quenched area increases. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p46.52">Less than 10mm in from the quenched end of the sample the hardness value has fallen to half that of the initial hardness. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p46.52">This indicates that the hardenability of the steel is low, and that a high critical cooling rate must be achieved to ensure full hardening of a component made from this material. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p46.52">The hardness value continues to decrease albeit at a much slower rate, to a point where the hardness is actually lower than that found by testing the "As received" sample. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.52">
<s n="s1.3;p47.52">Graph 2 shows the test results for the 817M40 steel, this material exhibits much better hardenability since the depth of the increased hardness is much deeper (~30mm from the quench sample end). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p47.52">Although the actual hardness values tend to fluctuate (due to surface\grain imperfections) the average hardness over the fist 30mm from the quench end can be seen to be approximately 620HV. Beyond 30mm the hardness falls rapidly until it's only slightly higher value that the "As received" sample. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p47.52">The better hardenability characteristics are due to the 817M40 containing extra alloying elements which help to slow down the transformation to the equilibrium state. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.52">
<s n="s1.1;p48.52">Graph 3 shows the results of the two quench hardened steels, note that the initial hardness values at the quenched end are close, showing that for thin section material (&lt;5mm) the 070M55 steel would make the most suitable choice due to its lower manufacturing costs, and the 817M40 is best suited to thicker section materials where full hardening is to be achieved throughout the larger components. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p49.52">
<s n="s1.1;p49.52">Hardening of steels is done for many reasons, such as tooling applications when working with other materials (Drill, or saw blade), or for applications where high strength is required automobile springs or inspection gages. </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.52">
<s n="s1.5;p50.52">The hardness of carbon steels can be improved greatly by quenching from high temperature when all the elements of the steel are in an austenitic phase. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p50.52">To ensure full quench hardening high cooling rates must be achieved so as not to pass the nose of the C-curve on the TTT diagram. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p50.52">This is possible when using thin steel sheet or small diameter rods (&lt;25mm) and quenching in water. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p50.52">However on thicker section only the surface may harden, or on very large sections even the surface may not harden. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p50.52">High cooling rates can cause internal stresses in the steel and lead to distortion and cracking. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.52">
<s n="s1.3;p51.52">This problem can be overcome with the addition of alloying elements, such as Manganese, chromium, Molybdenum, Carbon &amp; Nickel. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p51.52">These alloying elements slow down the phase transformations allowing longer cooling times, enabling much thicker sections to be fully hardened. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p51.52">The disadvantage of adding these alloying elements is the extra cost of producing the alloy steel grades. </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.52">
<s n="s1.2;p52.52">To gain maximum hardenability in moderate sized sections a carbon content of 0.6-0.8% is necessary. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p52.52">Above 1% carbon hardenability decreases as the carbon tends to promote the formation of ferrite. </s>
