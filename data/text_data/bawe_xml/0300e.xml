<head rend="bold">Question 1</head>
<p n="p1.26">
<s n="s1.6;p1.26">Ikea's philosophy is to provide "low price, value for money furnishings with a wide range of choice". </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.26">This philosophy, along with Ikea's associated competitive strategy, influences the operations performance objectives of the company. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.26">The company's overall competitive strategy influences the operation's competitive role within the company which in turn influences the performance objectives. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.26">It will be shown that the resulting main performance objectives of Ikea's operations are Cost (influenced by the philosophy and overall strategy of offering "prices so low the majority of people can afford to buy them") and Flexibility (most specifically Mix Flexibility, influenced by the overall strategy of providing a "wide range of home furnishings"). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.26">In contrast it will be demonstrated that Ikea's traditional competitors would probably place more importance on the Quality objective than perhaps Ikea would, whereas the Cost objective would be a less important objective. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.26">In the following paragraphs, the five performance objectives (Slack et al p.44) of Ikea and traditional competitors will be compared and contrasted. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Quality</head>
<p n="p2.26">
<s n="s1.3;p2.26">Whilst the quality performance objective is important to Ikea (their philosophy states "We must not compromise on function or technical quality"), it is nevertheless relatively less important than the cost and flexibility objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.26">In contrast, traditional competitors place greater importance on quality, particularly with regards to customer service. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.26">At Ikea, customers must pick the parts off the shelves in the warehouse, whereas traditional competitors will in general allow for delivery directly from the warehouse shelf to the customer's vehicle or final destination. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Speed</head>
<p n="p3.26">
<s n="s1.3;p3.26">The speed objective for both Ikea and its competitors is less important than other performance objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.26">This is especially so for Ikea when it comes to that specific subdivision of the speed performance objective which is the time taken for the total transaction of going to Ikea, making the purchase and returning. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.26">This process is usually longer than for traditional retailers because the layout of the Ikea store results in customers spending more time that at traditional competitors (typically 2 and up to 4 hours). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Dependability</head>
<p n="p4.26">
<s n="s1.5;p4.26">For Ikea, the dependability objective is probably less important than the cost and flexibility objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.26">When it comes to opening hours, dependability is equally important for Ikea as it is for traditional competitors. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.26">With regards to queuing however, dependability is less important for Ikea, where one manager is reported to have stated "We are famous for our queues", illustrating acceptance of this and therefore that increasing dependability when it comes to queuing isn't a main performance objective. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.26">In contrast, traditional competitors generally have shorter queuing times. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.26">With regards to parking, however, Ikea has constant availability and so place importance on dependability in this arena, whereas this isn't always the case with its competitors. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Flexibility</head>
<p n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.1;p5.26">Flexibility is one of the two most important performance objectives for Ikea (cost being the other). </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Mix Flexibility</head>
<p n="p6.26">
<s n="s1.3;p6.26">Ikea achieves mix flexibility through mass customisation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.26">It achieves this through design of modular components and also through each stores stocking about 10 000 of the 14 000+ items of the Ikea range. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.26">In contrast, traditional competitors generally have far less flexibility than Ikea due to much smaller stock ranges. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">Product/service flexibility</head>
<p n="p7.26">
<s n="s1.3;p7.26">Ikea's philosophy states "By daring to be different, we find new ways". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.26">This strategic objective can influence (or vice versa) the product/service flexibility objective to introduce new of modified products, resulting in the "creative sourcing" from approximately 2100 suppliers in 63 countries. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.26">In contrast, competitors generally have far less product flexibility due to in part to having far less flexibility in sourcing. </s>
</p>
</div3>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Cost</head>
<p n="p8.26">
<s n="s1.5;p8.26">Cost is the other of the two most important objectives for Ikea. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.26">Ikea's philosophy is once again to provide "low price, value for money furnishings with a wide range of choice". </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.26">Cost is one of its major competitive factors. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.26">Whilst its competitors will see cost as a major factor, it is relatively less of a competitive factor than it is for Ikea. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.26">Ikea achieves low cost by: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.26">
<s n="s1.3;p9.26">Reducing staff numbers and therefore the associated cost of hiring and paying them. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.26">It does this by using automated machines in the warehouse (robots) and store (integrated computer systems). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.26">It also manages to keep staff numbers down by being largely a self service store. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.26">
<s n="s1.1;p10.26">Facilities are out of town where they are cheaper. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.26">
<s n="s1.1;p11.26">Material costs - by sourcing from 2100 different suppliers, the company manages to achieve economies of scale. </s>
