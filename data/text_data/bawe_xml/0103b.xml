<s n="s3.4;p1.63">These are genes from the mother which are inherited by the embryos and which are essential for the correct and complete development of the embryo. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.63">In <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi>, there are 3 major developmental pathways studied: the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis, the specification of the germline and the dorsal-ventral formation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.63">
<s n="s1.5;p2.63">The anterior- posterior axis is set up through maternal and paternal contribution. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.63">The position of the sperm after entry into the egg specifies the posterior pole. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.63">Maternal material consists of PAR proteins which are localized at different poles through the action of centrosomes brought by the sperm. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.63">These proteins are required for maintenance of the asymmetry along with the CDC-42 G-protein. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.63">An array of other proteins such as RIC-8, LET-99, LIN-5 and others are also involved in a-p axis formation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.63">
<s n="s1.2;p3.63">Once the egg is fertilized in undergoes a series of divisions that give rise to somatic blastomeres and germline blastomeres. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.63">Specification of the germline involves the maternal genes <hi rend="italic">pie-1</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">mex-1. pie-1</hi> encodes a protein that has dual functionality: it blocks mRNA translation in germline blastomeres and induces maternal programs involved in germ cell development. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.63">
<s n="s1.3;p4.63">Finally, the dorsal-ventral formation relies on the somatic blastomeres, in particular ABa, ABp and EMS. ABa generates the anterior pharyngeal cells through cell-cell interaction with EMS, also involving the receptor GLP-1 and an unknown ligand. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.63">EMS forms the posterior pharyngeal cells autonomously and with the help of the <hi rend="italic">skn-1</hi> gene which is distributed unequally. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.63">Finally ABp forms the rectal and valve cells through interaction between its receptor GLP-1 as well, and the ligand APX-1 signalled from P <hi rend="sub">2</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.63">
<s n="s1.1;p5.63">All these genes have homologies with other species including human, and although most of them form a complex interactive network, their analysis is vital for understanding human development. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p7.63">This free living, non-parasitic soil nematode has all the characteristics of the ideal model organism: it is small, easy to manipulate, cheap, has a short life cycle and most importantly its genome (which is approximately 100 Mbp, that is to say 20 times bigger than that of <hi rend="italic">E. coli</hi> and about 1/30 of that of the human) shows 40% homology to that of the human (Gilbert, 2003). </s>

<s n="s2.7;p8.63">It is also transparent making the tracking of cells and following of cell lineages (which is most of the time invariant) very easy using reporter genes such as GFP (green fluorescent protein) (Gilbert, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.63">Its genome also makes it easy to mutate it: various mutagens can be used, such as EMS, to define mutants. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.63">Mutants can also be obtained using reverse genetics particularly RNA interference (RNAi) which consists of transcribing RNA in vitro from a specific target gene and injecting it into the gonad of wild type worms. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.63">It then prevents the production of the protein product of the target gene (Rose and Kemphues, 1998). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.63">The latter has been extensively used to study maternally expressed genes. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p12.63">Just before fertilization, the <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> oocyte is arrested in meiotic prophase I. The oocyte pronucleus moves away from the side contacting the spermatheca and the nuclear envelope breaks down (Gotta and Ahringer, 2001). </s>

</p>
<p n="p13.63">
<s n="s1.1;p13.63">Sperm entry triggers 3 events: completion of meiosis with extrusion of 2 polar bodies, formation of a protective eggshell (its rigidity forces the embryo into an ovoid shape) and finally the arrangement of the a-p axis (Lyczak et al., 2002; Gotta and Arhinger, 2001; Rose and Kemphues, 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.63">
<s n="s1.2;p14.63">The position of the sperm appears to polarize the zygote (it defines the posterior end and the a-p axis which is the long axis of the egg) bringing along centrosomes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.63">Meanwhile, the embryo undergoes a process known as pseudocleavage (Lyczak et al., 2002; Cowan and Hyman, 2004) (see figure 2 for a detailed schematic diagram of this process). </s>

<s n="s2.3;p16.63">This is further exemplified by the fact that sperm lacking DNA can still fertilize the oocyte and determine the polarity (Gotta and Ahringer, 2001). </s>
