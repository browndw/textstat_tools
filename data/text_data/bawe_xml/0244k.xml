<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.34">
<s n="s1.3;p1.34">The idea of an unconditional basic income (UBI) has been coming to the forefront of political discussion in recent times especially in European countries such as the Netherlands where its merits are being looked at more closely in an attempt to find a solution to unemployment and high levels of poverty. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.34">A UBI has been justified in terms of having the means to do what one might want to do, an argument of real freedom put forward predominantly by Philippe Van Parijs, and in terms of justice and equality of opportunity, an argument associated with John Rawls. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.34">There have been further advantages proposed but they have tended to be of a more pragmatic nature and it is the principled arguments of Rawls and of distributive justice which I will argue present the strongest reasoning for a UBI. I am going to compare the merits of my argument with those of other supporters and then attempt to defend a UBI against the many objections and alternatives which have been suggested. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.34">
<s n="s1.3;p2.34">Van Parijs defines a UBI as being paid by the government to every full member of society (excluding children) even if a person is unwilling to work, irrespective of them being rich or poor, whoever they might live with and with no regard to which part of the country they may live in. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.34">In this way there is no discrimination against anyone and no need for the amount received to have been means tested as is done with the benefit system in the United Kingdom today. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.34">This definition lends itself to many benefits which could be enjoyed by everyone who was a citizen of that particular country and therefore were able to receive an income. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.34">
<s n="s1.4;p3.34">The principal advantage of a basic income is probably the fact that a guaranteed social wage gives everyone a much larger than normal scope for choosing what to do with their life. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.34">In fact nearly all of the arguments in support of a UBI "are all animated by the common aim of enhancing individuals' occupational freedom." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.4;p3.34">There is a choice of being able to do voluntary or charity work which many people may like to do but are unable due to financial constraints. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.34">There is also the possibility for people to remain at home to be a housewife or husband and look after children or indeed another loved one who needs caring for such as an elderly parent. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.34">The extra income will allow people to be safe in the knowledge that they will not starve if they find themselves in a position where they cannot go out and earn a living, for whatever reason. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.34">Andrew Reeve writes that in the sense of thinking about opportunities to live as we might wish, "an unconditional income (at least of a certain level) adds to our choice-set the opportunity to consider the choice between work and leisure in a way otherwise unavailable." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s3.3;p4.34">Van Parijs adds that "what the suggested institutional set-up is intended to do is not to discourage as much as possible waged labour or a career-dominated existence, but to do as much as can be done in order to provide everyone with a genuine opportunity to make different choices."<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.34">As well as someone being able to decide what they want to do with their life a UBI gives people the choice of <hi rend="italic">when</hi> to do certain things. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.34">This independence means that wives would be free to leave abusive husbands without having to worry about having little money and people would be able to choose when to marry and have children with less regard to their financial status. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.34">It would also be possible to take more time over making important decisions and may give people the opportunity to try things beforehand or travel and see more of the world before being tied down. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.34">This is especially important in light of the current emphasis in society about the seemingly 'right' way to do things and the mindset that the best jobs are those with the biggest salaries and unfortunately it is the case that often people do not get the chance to enjoy the world for what it is and experience its diverse culture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.34">
<s n="s1.5;p6.34">In addition it allows those who want to change career "to opt out of paid employment for a while and to return to the educational system (by bearing the major part of the finance cost of schooling) and it allows those with a strong vocation unrecognised by the market to stick to it." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s2.5;p6.34">Moreover a guaranteed basic income could provide an income cushion to encourage 're-skilling' amongst workers. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.34">As advances in technology and changes in industry have rapidly occurred in the past few decades, politicians and employers have encouraged workers to acquire new skills and knowledge. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.34">However, "only a tiny proportion of workers in selected industries and occupations are provided with transitional income assistance when they temporarily leave full-time work to re-train or receive further education." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.5;p6.34">Jobs themselves may also be improved as businesses could be forced into increasing wages and improving working conditions as a consequence of workers' increased "bargaining power with employers"<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.006"/> and the resulting safety net to protect them from market vulnerabilities in the economy. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s2.5;p7.34">As a result of the biological differences females often still take primary responsibility for child-care and adjust their working lives to accommodate family needs. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.34">Secondly, and not coincidentally, women in America, for example, only earn about three quarters of what men earn and this can lead to "lifelong economic insecurity".<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.008"/> Women could now be paid for looking after the home and children which is what many see as being an equally worthwhile job compared to working in an office all day. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.34">Anne Alstott believes that even a UBI below subsistence level could make a real difference in women's lives. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.34">She gives an excellent example where if you take the poverty line for a person in America being about $8,500 in 1999 then straight away if a UBI of less than half of that was considered it would mean for the median single mother an 18 percent increase in income - for the median elderly woman, a 40 percent increase.<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.34">I believe that all of the above advantages generated by a UBI can be justified in terms of Rawlsian justice which states that everyone should have equality of opportunity to achieve what they wish. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.34">This concept of justice as fairness is qualified by Rawls in a situation where everyone is under a so-called veil of ignorance in the original position. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.34">Rawls argues that in the original position where no-one knows anything of themselves or their place in society then they would choose the best conditions possible for everyone in case they were the one that ended up in the worst position. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.34">This certainly supports the idea of a UBI as a basic income helps the prospects of the majority of the most disadvantaged members of society not least by freeing "individuals from being bound to accept paid employment in order to meet their fundamental needs,"<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.010"/> and giving them time and choice if it is required. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s2.5;p9.34">Rawls further qualifies this with his conception of the political community as a system of social cooperation and the understanding of social justice as "the fair organisation of such a cooperative venture and fair allocation of its joint products." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s3.5;p9.34">Despite critics being quick to point out that social cooperation would invariably mean having a job to contribute to society it could equally mean helping out voluntarily or providing entertainment through possessing a particular skill. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.34">Moreover, Rawls's second principle of justice "gives priority to protecting individuals from being disadvantaged in the competition for jobs by class origin, and other misfortunes in the social lottery, over maximising the income and wealth of the least advantaged." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s5.5;p9.34">This in fact lends itself to a more radical notion that a UBI is preferable in society even if the position of the least advantaged is not maximmined. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p10.34">In reasoning that everyone has an equal entitlement to society's natural resources it reduces the problem of having to work out and favour a particular type of the 'good life' which as was mentioned earlier has become symptomatic of our society. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.34">This advantage is what Loek Groot has termed the neutrality postulate and is essential when trying to decide upon what is fair and what is not as Richard Arneson points out "Van Parijs would quite reasonably ask on what basis I claim to know that surfing is a better activity than eating potato chips and watching mindless TV." <ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.014"/> </s>

<p n="p11.34">
<s n="s1.4;p11.34">However the Rawlsian idea of justice is by no means the only argument in favour of a UBI and it is Van Parijs who presents perhaps the other most compelling argument. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.34">The major difference with Van Parijs is that he bases his argument on the idea of real freedom and states that "one is really free, as opposed to just formally free, to the extent that possesses the means, not just the right, to do whatever one might want to do." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s3.4;p11.34">Thus the leximining of real liberty is the key issue for Van Parijs where as "Rawls insists on the universality of the principles of justice"<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.016"/> and sees equality of opportunity as being the main concern. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.34">Van Parijs also makes the case for a UBI helping people out of the unemployment trap and therefore alleviating poverty. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p12.34">Many people would be reluctant to look for work due to the "uncertainty in renouncing a safe and regular benefit as a result of taking up a job which they may soon prove unable to keep or to bear." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244k-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s4.5;p12.34">This would not be the case with a UBI because as soon as someone managed to find a job they liked they would be immediately earning more than they would be getting from solely their government income. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.34">Although this is a welcome advantage of a UBI it does not really lend much weight to its cause as there are other ways that could possibly alleviate the unemployment trap, for example, the fact that people need to be actively seeking work in order to claim in the United Kingdom or the possibility of cutting unemployment benefits altogether. </s>
