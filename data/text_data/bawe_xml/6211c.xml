<p>I would like to express my gratitude to Alan B Lloyd for sending two unpublished articles to aid my research. Also to Kasia Szpakowska, Geraldine Pinch and Janet Johnson, who directed me to some of the harder to find texts. Finally I wish to thank John Taylor from the British Museum.</p>

<s n="s1.4;p2.129">I shall therefore examine the Wisdom texts and popular stories to provide a list of values the Egyptians held concerning the use of magic. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.129">The resulting criteria shall be compared with the magical techniques found in State Magic, Funerary Magic and Popular Magic,<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.002"/> to grant us an overall comparison between moral thought and magical practice. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.129">This introduction shall also serve as a discussion of several key Egyptian principles, such as Ma'at and Heka, which are crucial to the understanding of Egyptian magical practice. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.129">Once these ideas have been discussed and the ground rules have been established; I shall proceed to analyse each field of magic individually and then conclude in a separate piece at the end. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p3.129">The use of objects and texts that are designed to 'ward off the blow of events'<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.004"/> will be classed as magic in this dissertation. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p4.129">Let us now move on to a brief introduction to the concept of Ma'at. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.129">The Egyptians believed that Ma'at was the cosmic order that kept the universe functioning. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.129">The word Ma'at itself can be translated into English as 'truth', 'order', 'justice' or 'balance'.<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.005"/> From a moral standpoint, people were expected to live their daily lives in accordance to Ma'at. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.129">Allen<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.006"/> explains that 'we distinguish good and evil from codes of law and commandments. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.129">Ancient Egypt had no such codes: for the Egyptians the distinction was determined by practical experience'. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.129">Gahlin<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.007"/> informs us that rebellion, envy, deceit, greed, laziness, injustice and ingratitude were all crimes of Ma'at. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p5.129">Gahlin<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.008"/> adds 'Life in Egypt was thought to be characterized by Ma'at, whereas outside the borders <hi rend="italic">Isfet</hi> [chaos] reigned'. </s>

<head rend="bold">Concepts of Heka and its Literary References</head>
<p n="p6.129">
<s n="s1.4;p6.129">Concerning the idea of Heka, there needs to be a brief distinction between the modern day (and even the classical) opinion of magic and the Egyptian viewpoint. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.129">Lloyd provides us with an excellent summary of this difference in two articles.<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.010"/> He states that 'magic in our sense, did not exist for much of Ancient Egyptian History'.<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.011"/> The idea of the universe according to the Ancient Egyptians was in fact a 'world of limitless possibilities'<ref target="BAWE_6211c-ftnote.012"/> and those who had an understanding of magical rites could make their options considerably more expansive. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.129">Whereas the Greeks and indeed modern society generally believe that magic is subverting the natural order; the Egyptians saw it as an integral force that bound the universe together and both man and god had access to it. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.129">Naturally though, the gods had Heka as an attribute; while men would have to learn it over the course of their lives. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p127.129">However I hope to remedy that to a certain degree by including the material I have studied in the bibliography. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p127.129">Upon consulting it, the reader will be able to assess the full range of magical rites and practices I examined as part of this study. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p127.129">I would hope that the content of the study is broad reaching enough to be of use in the discussion of magic and ethical practice. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p127.129">The bibliography should be able to draw the reader's attention to the aspects of Egyptian magical practice that were studied, but were omitted from the work, due to the limited space. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p128.129">Now let us turn our attention to the results of the study. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p128.129">The main aim of the dissertation was to examine Lichtheim's statement that any magical approach: <hi rend="italic">'could not be but contrary to morality and piety'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p128.129">Throughout the course of the investigation, we have found that magical techniques had, in fact, a certain ethical usage and even known illegal uses of such magic. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p128.129">Seemingly then it appears that Lichtheim's conclusion may not be the case and that magic and ethics were set in harmony with each other in Ancient Egypt after all. </s>
</p>
<p n="p129.129">
<s n="s1.2;p129.129">The main strength of this dissertation is that the ethical system was composed from extracts, not from magical literature, but from the ethical works or 'Wisdom Literature', which Lichtheim felt was in direct contrast to the magical approach. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p129.129">If we can demonstrate that Egyptian magic was used with an ethical system that we can deduce from the ethical texts, then surely I would advocate that we should not place ethics and magic as polar opposites of each other, but integrate the two. </s>
