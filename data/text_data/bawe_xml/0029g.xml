<s n="s1.3;p1.15">This essay will analyse whether the two predominant theories in North America relating to how the landscape should be best utilised, namely those of pastoralism and progression, were at all compatible and if so, whether a third, middle way was therefore possible. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.15">A wide variety of writers and artists, both American and English, will be analysed in order to gauge opinion, predominantly during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.15">Leo Marx's book <hi rend="italic">The Machine in the Garden</hi> will be given particular attention due to the nature of its study. </s>

<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.5;p2.15">When Europeans first arrived in North America, the majority longed for a natural environment in which they could be close to nature. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.15">America was seen as a New World, a type of utopia in which the colonists could leave behind the disease ridden cities of Europe and start afresh. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.15">There was a tendency to idolize rural ways, and, consequently, pastoralism was advocated as the ideal form of landscape. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.15">Low-intensity farming was seen as idyllic because land was plentiful in North America. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.15">The dominance of the pastoral theory continued and even experienced a revival in the post-revolutionary period after the English had been beaten and a Republic declared. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.15">
<s n="s1.8;p3.15">Thomas Jefferson put forward a case for the pastoral ideal in <hi rend="italic">Notes on the State of Virginia</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.15">His ideas reflected the post-revolutionary patriotism that so many American citizens felt at that time. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.15">His argument centred on the fact that the abundance of land made America a place where the pastoral ideal was possible - 'Those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of God... </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.15">For the general operations of manufacture, let out work-shops remain in Europe." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029g-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s5.8;p3.15">As Marx describes, early colonists wished to settle North America as a cultivated garden. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.15">He also goes on to explain Jefferson's view more fully - 'By the same token, if all America somehow could be transformed into a garden, a permanently rural republic, then its citizens might escape from the terrible sequence of power struggles, wars, and cruel repressions suffered in Europe." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029g-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s7.8;p3.15">This seems a rather positive, na√Øve even, outlook. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.15">It seemed unrealistic that Jefferson's dream would be able to be achieved. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.15">Indeed, within a relatively short space of time, the American landscape had been permanently altered by the rapid development and spread of industry and technology. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.15">How was it possible that this transformation could take place in a society which seemed to espouse so vehemently a pastoral way of life? </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.15">What caused this seismic shift in opinion and was it compatible with the pastoral notion of landscape? </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.8;p5.15">Between 1830 and 1860 there was a huge degree of technological development contributing to a period of sustained economic growth in America. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.15">In this thirty year time span over 30,000 miles of railway track was laid down. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.15">Certain writers came to advocate technology such as Tench Coxe, a young merchant, who promoted the value of machines to American society. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.15">He was excited at the potential power that machines and factories would be able to supply as well as their ability to reduce labour costs. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.15">It was Coxe who effectively laid the ground for the emergence of the machine as an American cultural symbol, as his ideas became increasingly accepted by the general public and by the mid-nineteenth century a contrasting image of the machine started to attract the attention of American intellectuals. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.15">The railway came to symbolise progress to the American people and was welcomed by most, as it broke down regional barriers and guaranteed social equality by providing everybody with a mode of transport, irrespective of wealth or status. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.15">Indeed, the railroad became a national obsession in America in the 1830s - 'a testament to the will of man rising over natural obstacles, and, yet, confined by its iron rails to a predetermined path, it suggests a new sort of fate." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029g-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s8.8;p5.15">That is, one that apparently excluded the initial ideal of the pastoral landscape. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p6.15">Having given a brief outline of the two contrasting ideologies, the pastoral and progressive attitudes to the landscape, it is necessary to analyse whether these two theories were compatible. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p6.15">Initially, most writers found the acceptance of technology into the rural landscape extremely hard to accept. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p6.15">Nathaniel Hawthorne's observations of his surroundings written whilst in the woods known as the 'Sleepy Hollow' near Concord, Massachusetts indicate a completely different point of view to Coxe's. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p6.15">He is clearly enjoying the natural environment - 'Indian corn, now in its most perfect growth... </s>

<s n="s7.10;p6.15">However, a passing train suddenly disturbs the peace - 'the startling shriek of the train whistle bearing down upon him, [forces] him to acknowledge the existence of a reality to the pastoral dream." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029g-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s8.10;p6.15">At end of the passage, the train can no longer be seen or heard, but Hawthorne cannot get back completely that sense of calm and serenity that he had felt before the interruption of the locomotive. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p6.15">The reader gets a sense that this has never happened before, as if the virginity of the land has been taken by the train and can never be regained. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p6.15">Writers usually associated machines and technology in general with masculine aggression and nature with feminine submission. </s>
