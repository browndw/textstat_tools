<s n="s1.4;p1.68">The impact of depreciation in real exchange on trade balance has been a long standing debate in policy circles. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.68">Proponents of the international monetarist approach argue that real devaluation of currency raises the price of traded good relative to non-traded goods leading to fewer imports while, <hi rend="italic">ceteris paribus</hi>, exports become more competitive resulting in an overall improvement in trade balance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.68">Proponents of the absorption approach such as (Alexander 1952) argue that "devaluation may change terms of trade, increase production, and switch production from foreign to domestic goods, thus improving the trade balance" (Bahmani-Oskooee 1984). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.68">Channels through which devaluation can negatively affect the trade balance are discussed in (Katseli 1983). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.68">
<s n="s1.6;p2.68">Empirical evidence is mixed: (Bahmani-Oskooee 1989) finds the long-term effect of devaluation to be negative in the case of India, Greece, and Korea; and positive in the case of Thailand. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.68">The U.S. trade balance deteriorated in 1972 after a devaluation of the dollar in 1971. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.68">(Upadgyaya, Dhakal 1997) find that though devaluation improved trade balance for Colombia, Mexico and Thailand, the effect was statistically significant only for Mexico. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.68">For Cyprus, Greece and Morocco, devaluation had a statistically significant negative effect on trade balance. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.68">(Himarios Jan 1989), in his extensive study, finds a positive effect of devaluation on trade balance in over 80% of the cases studied. </s>

</p>
<p n="p5.68">
<s n="s1.4;p5.68">Following the crisis, India undertook a complete overhaul of its macroeconomic policies along more liberal and capitalist lines. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.68">The economy was opened up, freer trade was allowed, the over-valued exchange rate was allowed to depreciate both in nominal and real terms, policies to improve public finance were implemented, and fetters to the operation of private enterprise were slowly removed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.68">In short, India's economy faced a radically different set of policies which led to improved economic performance - increased GDP growth rate to over 6%, increased capital formation, higher savings, etc. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p67.68">We find, in the case of India, that devaluation improves trade balance. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p67.68">Our results contradict those of (Bahmani-Oskooee 1984) who finds that real devaluation worsens the trade balance for India in the long-run. </s>

</p>
<p n="p68.68">
<s n="s1.5;p68.68">The results of this study lend themselves to policy prescriptions suggesting devaluation as a measure to improve trade balance. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p68.68">One must, however, approach the result with caution. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p68.68">Even though devaluation might improve the trade balance, it is important for a developing country like India to analyse its trade baskets and the impact devaluation would have on it. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p68.68">Such an analysis is important before devaluation is used as a policy tool since it could have negative long-run effects on growth if it adversely affects basic industrial inputs and causes other perverse distortions in the basic input-output matrix. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p68.68">Therefore, a detailed study of the components of the basket of traded goods is recommended if devaluation is pursued as a policy tool. </s>
