<s n="s1.3;p1.27">Condensation reaction is a chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form a larger molecule with elimination of a small molecule, usually H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O. The condensation of an aldehyde (bezaldehyde); RCHO and ketone (acetone); R(C=O)R' is investigated by calculating the percentage yield of the one large ketone product formed from filtration, crystallisation and recrystallisation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.27">The melting point is also measured to detect the purity of the ketone. </s>
