<head rend="bold">Measurement Limitations</head>
<p n="p68.79">
<s n="s1.5;p68.79">The stylus system has several limitations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p68.79">The tip can only cover depressions where the radius of curvature is greater than that of the tip. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p68.79">In places where there is a depression in the surface which has a radius of curvature smaller than that of the tip, the tip will not be able to reach the bottom of the depression. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p68.79">This means that the correct depth will not be measured. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p68.79">This is a major limitation and for this reason, the tip is made to be as small as possible (just a couple of microns in radius). </s>
</p>
<p n="p69.79">
<s n="s1.8;p69.79">There are also limitations to the horizontal motion of the stylus. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p69.79">It must not move above a critical speed. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p69.79">If it travels across the surface too fast the tip may come of the surface immediately after it as reached a peak. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p69.79">This will result in an inaccurate recording of the surface features. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p69.79">As mentioned already, a spring is used to provide a static torque so that the tip is pushed into the surface. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p69.79">If the tip moves too fast over the surface there is also the possibility of it causing damage to the surface features. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p69.79">This must be avoided at all costs. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p69.79">There is little point in using measurements from a sample that has been damaged in the process. </s>

<head rend="bold">Design Improvements</head>
<p n="p70.79">
<s n="s1.4;p70.79">Using a laser interferometer as the displacement sensor has many advantages in that it is very accurate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p70.79">However, this accuracy is subject to the ambient conditions being carefully controlled. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p70.79">The wavelength of a laser beam in air is affected by the air pressure, temperature and humidity. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p70.79">These three factors need to be kept constant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p71.79">
<s n="s1.1;p71.79">The sampling rate that the computer uses to display the data could be increased thus giving a more continuous representation of the data. </s>
</p>
<p n="p72.79">
<s n="s1.3;p72.79">Similarly the frequency of the beam from the laser could be increased thus causing more interference patterns that can be detected. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p72.79">This is effectively increasing the resolution of the system. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p72.79">More light-dark cycles means that there is more raw data that can be processed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p73.79">
<s n="s1.2;p73.79">A further improvement but much more complicated would be to use more than one interferometer and double pass the beams to compensate for misalignment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p73.79">Making the mirror and prism system as small as possible would also help to compensate for misalignment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p74.79">
<s n="s1.5;p74.79">It was mentioned earlier that the radius of the stylus tip is a limitation on the vertical measurement. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p74.79">The tip should be made as small as is possible to give it every chance of measuring even the narrowest of depressions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p74.79">A more radical step would be to do away with the stylus tip altogether and use a laser beam directed at the surface. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p74.79">The beam would have to be very narrow to compensate for the roughness that would cause a scattering of the light. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p74.79">It would be a similar system to that used to measure the ocean floor but obviously on a much smaller scale. </s>
</p>
<p n="p75.79">
<s n="s1.4;p75.79">The translational speed of the stylus is another area that could be improved upon. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p75.79">A faster translation across the surface would allow the measurements to be taken more quickly. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p75.79">However a higher data sampling rate would be required if the spatial resolution is to be maintained. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p75.79">It is therefore important that the displacement sensor is able to cope with the increased rate of data acquisition. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>

<s n="s1.2;p76.79">The stylus system that has been designed uses a laser interferometer as the displacement sensor. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p76.79">This device is able to measure the smallest of changes in displacement and was therefore deemed to be the most suitable of the available sensors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p77.79">
<s n="s1.3;p77.79">The system allows for the optical output of the interferometer to be amplified and converted into digital output via an optical reader and an A/D converter. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p77.79">The data is processed to give an output on a computer in the form of a surface profile. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p77.79">This profile can be used to provide a calculation for surface roughness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p78.79">
<s n="s1.3;p78.79">The interferometer is a very precise piece of equipment that requires careful control of the ambient conditions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p78.79">There are limitations to both the accuracy of the vertical displacement reading due to the size of stylus tip and the frequency of the laser beam. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p78.79">The speed of measurement is limited due to the need for care when traversing across the surface so as not to damage the sample or cause the stylus tip to leave the surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p79.79">
<s n="s1.1;p79.79">Improvements to the system are based on increasing the resolution to give a greater sampling rate and increasing the accuracy of the interferometer by taking steps to correct misalignment. </s>
