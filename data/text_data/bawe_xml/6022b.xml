<head>DISCUSSION</head>
<p n="p16.23">
<s n="s1.1;p16.23">The result obtained for the % of salt in the butter is considered as satisfactory as most butter have a concentration of 1.5-2.0 % of salt. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.23">
<s n="s1.4;p17.23">An error that may have altered the results is based on the fact that during the extractions, it has been calculated that you get only the 90 % of the amount that you are required to extract. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.23">As the number of extractions grows, so does the percentage of error. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.23">So, in the 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> extraction we get the 90% of the aqueous phase, in the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> extraction we get the 90% of the 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> extract and in the 3 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> extraction we get the 90% of the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> extract. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.23">In this case, when we refer to an error, we refer to the amount of the liquid phase (aqueous phase) that we were not able to extract. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.23">
<s n="s1.2;p18.23">Some other errors may also occur. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.23">A common error is the sampling error which is partly avoided by the use of more than one sample when titrating. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.23">
<s n="s1.1;p19.23">Limitations due to the uncertainty of the instruments also exist but we consider them as not significant when doing our calculations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.23">
<s n="s1.1;p20.23">After obtaining the results from the other teams, we constructed a diagram showing the differences in the percentages of salt in butter found by all teams in terms of 95% confidence limits (+/- 2 SE). </s>
