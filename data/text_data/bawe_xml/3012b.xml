<s n="s1.8;p1.10">The following work is a 'critical essay' which focuses on the treatment of London in Dickens's novels and particularly in <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> (1837-39) and <hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi> (1855-57). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.10">Raymond Williams argued in an essay on Dickens published by M. Slater in 1970 that the nineteenth-century novelist "was the first English novelist to explore the modern city - in its form as the metropolis- as a social fact and as a human landscape".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.001"/> It is not uncommon to refer to Dickens as a writer of the city. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.10">Most of his novels are set in London and the role of the capital is often crucial in the development of the plots. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.10">This essay tries and analyses key critical texts - critical books, essays or journal articles- which consider the representation of London and the city in Dickens's novels. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.10">By relating and comparing them, the following study forms a basic critical history of Dickens's treatment of London and shows the evolution of critical studies of this subject area. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.10">This essay will first focus on a bibliography of Dickensian criticism written by R. C. Churchill in 1975.<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.002"/> This book is a valuable material to enter and start to tackle the subject since it provides the references of a wide range of works focusing on it. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.10">In a second part, a few critical texts on Dickens's London and representation of the city will be introduced and analysed. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.10">Finally, this essay will present and study the main and recurrent themes and ideas on the subject area that critics have underlined through the years. </s>

<s n="s1.22;p2.10">
<hi rend="italic">A Bibliography of Dickensian Criticism</hi>, 1836-1975 was published by R. C. Churchill in 1975. </s>
<s n="s2.22;p2.10">It refers to a great number of works on Dickens and it also provides many quotations. </s>
<s n="s3.22;p2.10">These quotes are either the main idea of a critical text dealing with the Victorian novelist or they are a relevant reference to Dickens extracted from a text which is not especially dedicated to him. </s>
<s n="s4.22;p2.10">The bibliography is divided into categories. </s>
<s n="s5.22;p2.10">For example, the first twenty pages are devoted to general criticism of the nineteenth-century. </s>
<s n="s6.22;p2.10">Another section focuses on aspects in Dickens such as "His Characters"<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.003"/> or "Dickens and Childhood"<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.22;p2.10">Among them, there is a section dedicated to "Dickens's London".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.005"/> It presents around thirty entries and some of them offer relevant quotations. </s>
<s n="s8.22;p2.10">In this section, R. C. Churchill refers to works written between 1837 and 1975. </s>
<s n="s9.22;p2.10">As a consequence, this bibliography provides materials contemporary with Dickens's time but which are hardly available today. </s>
<s n="s10.22;p2.10">However, they imply that Dickens's treatment of London was already a matter of critical concern at the time when the novelist was writing. </s>
<s n="s11.22;p2.10">For instance, Churchill quotes the English journalist Walter Bagehot who wrote in 1858 a review on Charles Dickens in which he stated that "Mr Dickens's genius is especially suited to the delineation of city life... </s>
<s n="s12.22;p2.10">He describes London like a special correspondent to prosperity." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s13.22;p2.10">As will be shown later in this essay, more recent critics of Dickens do not argue in favour of the association of London with prosperity. </s>
<s n="s14.22;p2.10">On the contrary, they underline the connection of the city with death or hell. </s>
<s n="s15.22;p2.10">The bibliography also refers to renowned writers who have commented on Dickens's London. </s>
<s n="s16.22;p2.10">They can be contemporaries of the Victorian novelist such as Ainsworth and Emerson. </s>
<s n="s17.22;p2.10">In the preface of his novel <hi rend="italic">Rookwood</hi> (1837), Ainsworth wrote that "Mr Dickens, with his wonderful knowledge of London life and character, and unequalled powers of delineation, has done more for this metropolis, in the <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist,</hi> than Paul de Kock, in all his works, has done for Paris".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.007"/> As for Emerson, he mentioned during a lecture at Boston in 1848 on 'English Traits' that "Dickens, with preternatural apprehension of the language and manners, and the varieties of street life, with pathos and laughter, with patriotic and still enlarging generosity, writes London tracts." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s18.22;p2.10">Other quotations come from later writers such as George Orwell who wrote in 1839 in an essay on Charles Dickens "...from the age of nine onwards he was brought up in London in commercial surroundings, and generally in an atmosphere of struggling poverty. </s>
<s n="s19.22;p2.10">Mentally he belongs to the small urban bourgeoisie..." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s20.22;p2.10">Among the works presented by Churchill, only the last mentioned, Alexander Welsh's The <hi rend="italic"> City of Dickens</hi> (1971) was made available for this essay and will be referred to in the following work. </s>
<s n="s21.22;p2.10">Churchill's book establishes a first approach to the treatment of London by Dickens, it mentions useful materials and quotations. </s>
<s n="s22.22;p2.10">Nevertheless, it remains mainly anecdotal and it is only by analysing proper critical texts that the writing of a critical history is possible. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.10">This essay focuses on three major critical books, J. Hillis Miller's <hi rend="italic">Charles Dickens : The World of His Novels</hi> (1970), A.Welsh's <hi rend="italic">The City of Dickens</hi> (1971) and F.S. Schwarzbach's <hi rend="italic">Dickens and the City (</hi>1979).These works were written by academics in the 1970's. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.10">They are regularly referred to by more recent studies on Dickens's London. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.10">This essay also mentions a non-academic work, the book introduced by Peter Ackroyd and commented by Dudgeon, <hi rend="italic">Dickens's London : an Imaginative Vision</hi> (1989). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.10">Besides, two other texts were useful for this critical history: M. Baumgarten's essay "Fictions of the city" (2001) and B. Deutschendorf's article "Dickens' <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist"</hi> (2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.17;p4.10">Both Hillis Miller and Schwarzbach present their studies by looking at a certain number of Dickens's novels and proceed by following the chronology of their publication. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p4.10">Miller explores six novels and analyses them as the transformation of the real world of Dickens into an imaginary world with certain special qualities of its own. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p4.10">He argues that "throughout all the swarming multiplicity of his novels", Dickens created a "world which is unique and the same".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.010"/> Miller points out that the element which presides at the centre of the imaginative universe of Dickens is the "great modern commercial city"<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.011"/> and he underlines Dickens's interpretation of the city-world. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p4.10">Schwarzbach's approach is similar to Miller's but if the latter analyses the world of Dickens in general, the former focuses on the treatment of the city only. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p4.10">Schwarzbach stresses that London played an important role in Dickens's own life and is at the centre of the novelist creative imagination. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p4.10">His work explores the Victorian writer's approach to the city and examines how it evolves through his novels. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p4.10">As for Welsh, he presents Dickens's treatment of the city as a great metaphor. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p4.10">At the difference of the two critics previously mentioned, he is more concerned by the symbolic meanings of the novelist's portrayal of London than the descriptions in themselves. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p4.10">Welsh divides his study in themes which are symbolically related to the Dickensian city. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p4.10">For example, he underlines the association of London with death and hell, greed and money, or the hearth and home in the different works of the novelist. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p4.10">As far as Ackroyd and Dudgeon are concerned, their study is more focused on the autobiographical dimension. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p4.10">It highlights the fact that Dickens incorporated his personal approach and experience of the city into his work. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p4.10">As for Baumgarten and Deutschendorf, both critics underline the connection between Dickens's characters and London and the way the novelist used the city as a reflection of his protagonists' personalities. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p4.10">All these different critical texts encompass a period of thirty five years, Miller's book was written in 1970 whereas Deutschendorf's article was published in 2005. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p4.10">Despite the gap in time, these various studies share many characteristics, analogies and connections can be drawn between them. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p4.10">The debate over Dickens and London sheds light on a great number of motifs which are recurrent from study to study. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p4.10">The aim of this essay is now to focus on these features and to interrelate the different theories and conceptions of them. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p5.10">On the one hand, Schwarzbach stresses the fictionalization of some events of the novelist's life. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.10">He argues that Dickens's "fiction makes free and creative use of every detail of his outer and inner life".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.012"/> The writer's novels depict characters, places or incidents which were often inspired by the his own life. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.10">Similarly, Ackroyd and Dudgeon emphasise the autobiographical dimension of <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi> (1849-50) and present the novel as "Dickens's auto-novel".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.013"/> On the other hand, Hillis Miller is more concerned by the novelist's personal state of mind at the time he was writing. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.10">He points out that a work such as <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi> (1836-37) is the verbal expression of Dickens's mood, or sensibility, or spiritual state" when he wrote it.<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.014"/> Although Schwarzbach argues that "Dickens could not conceive of meaningful life being lived anywhere outside of the city"<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.015"/>, most of the critics underline that the novelist also considered life in the city as impossible which is contradictory to Ainsworth's previous comment. </s>
