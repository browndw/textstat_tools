<p n="p10.19">
<s n="s1.6;p10.19">In organic production systems there are fairly limited ways to try and control the disease of crops. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.19">This is because the use of many fungicides, fertilizers and pesticides is prohibited or limited to extreme situations. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.19">Therefore other methods of disease control need to be used. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.19">A major way to try and control powdery mildew in crops is to grow varieties of wheat that are resistant to the disease. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.19">The varieties of wheat resistant to powdery mildew will change as after a few years, resistance to powdery mildew is likely to deteriorate. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.19">However, updates are available on a yearly basis on wheat varieties that are most resistant to powdery mildew. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p11.19">(See <seg type="URL" n="http://www.smallgrains.ncsu.edu/Varieties/Varieties.html"/> to find these varieties) </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.19">
<s n="s1.2;p12.19">Varieties of wheat that are more resistant to powdery mildew should seriously be considered by organic farmers because a resistance to this disease will mean that the crop has the chance to produce a higher yield, as it will intercept more light and will not have to compete for nutrients. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.19">This method of weed control will also not have any negative effects on the environment which is viewed as an important aspect of organic farming, and therefore is a method that should initially be tried. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.19">
<s n="s1.10;p13.19">The UK has a varied climate and different diseases favour different climates. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p13.19">Planting the wheat crop later could be a possible defence against powdery mildew for organic farmers. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p13.19">This is because powdery mildew does not grow in winter weather or cold fall (Source <hi rend="italic">Organic field crop production and marketing 2005</hi>). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p13.19">Spore release and germination of powdery mildew is also reduced when there is water or dew on the leaf surface (Source <hi rend="italic">HGCA 2000</hi>). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p13.19">This means that powdery mildew is more likely to affect wetter areas of the UK and therefore this should be taken into account by organic farmers. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p13.19">A problem with the idea of planting wheat later is that wheat does not grow well in winter weather or cold fall and therefore although this method may help to defend against powdery mildew, the wheat crop is likely to suffer anyway due to being grown in unfavourable conditions. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p13.19">Another alternative to growing the whole crop at a later date could be to spread out the planting date so that the whole crop may not be susceptible to the disease. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p13.19">This would allow some of the crop to be grown at the more favourable period for wheat and some to be grown slightly later at a time when powdery mildew is less active. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p13.19">Again, this method of attempting to control powdery mildew will not have any negative impacts on the environment, but the practicality of spreading out the plating date could be an issue to due time restraints. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p13.19">This method may therefore not be an option which is favoured by some organic farmers. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p15.19">The use of crop rotations will be an important element for an organic farmer trying to control powdery mildew in wheat. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p15.19">This is because crop rotation will help to break down the disease cycle of powdery mildew. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.19">It will also help to reduce the number of inoculums with initiate disease on stubble and other cereals. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.19">However, crop rotations will only help to control powdery mildew to a certain extent because the disease is also airborne spread and therefore even with good crop rotation to help break the disease cycle it is still possible for powdery mildew to spread by other methods. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.19">Crop rotations are a method used in most farming systems. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.19">It is not an impractical method and is no more time consuming than not rotating. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.19">This means that organic farmers will have few reasons as to why they should not at least try rotating crops as a means of breaking down the disease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.19">
<s n="s1.5;p16.19">As a last resort to help control powdery mildew in organic wheat, farmers may opt to use non- synthetic pesticides and fungicides. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.19">However, in order for organic farmers to use these, they must first have prior approval from their certified body to use the treatment. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.19">This method should be used as a last resort only because it can disrupt beneficial insects and have an affect on the stability of organic farming. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.19">This therefore indicates that this method can have an impact on the environment and so is not fully supportive of the concept of organic farming. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.19">This method is however likely to be fairly efficient at controlling the disease. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.4;p17.19">Powdery mildew is a disease that can affect wheat grown both conventionally and organically. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.19">In organic production systems there are fewer options available to help try and control this disease in wheat. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.19">This means that careful planning is needed with regards to the type of wheat grown, the time of sowing and also the time in a crop rotation that the wheat is grown. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.19">These factors will help to try and control powdery mildew in wheat and are also methods that will have less effect on the environment and therefore will be more in line with organic standards. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.3;p18.19">However, as the disease can also be airborne spread these planning factors will only help to a certain extent. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.19">It may be that organic farmers who have a severe attack of powdery mildew to their wheat crop will have to opt to use non-synthetic pesticides and fungicides. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.19">This method should always be a last resort for farmers and should be carefully considered and of course needs prior approval from their certified body. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.4;p19.19">For an organic farmer, there are measures that can be taken prior to disease infection which will try and avoid the contamination of the crop. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.19">However, these are all actions which need to be considered before the crop is planted. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.19">If, after the careful planning of these factors the wheat crop is still attacked by powdery mildew that is when the organic producer has fewer options than the conventional producer in terms of controlling this disease. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.19">This therefore indicates that for an organic producer trying to control crop diseases careful planning is required prior to the planting of the crop. </s>
