<s n="s1.4;p76.93">The theory shown in the introduction predicts that plots of resistivity against temperature for the copper and copper doped with 6% tin should be straight lines with gradients equal to their temperature coefficient of resistivity. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p76.93">Both graphs do produce good approximations of straight lines, with the line passing through more than 2/3 of the error bars in each case. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p76.93">For semiconductors and sample <hi rend="bold">C</hi>, the germanium source, theory showed that a graph of ln ρ against 1 / Temperature should produce a graph with a straight line of gradient equal to E <hi rend="sub">g</hi> / 2k. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p76.93">Although observing a straight linear relationship, the strength of the correlation is not so great and the line only passes through 4 of the 9 error bars. </s>
</p>
<p n="p77.93">
<s n="s1.2;p77.93">The error bars shown on the graphs produced are visible and quite large. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p77.93">This suggests that the precision of the results could be limited, especially since most of the error was contributed to by making certain the measurements were taken at the right temperature and this was largely a fault of the heating equipment and the way the heat was transferred to the oil bath. </s>
</p>
<p n="p78.93">
<s n="s1.3;p78.93">The uncertainties in the measured values of K and E <hi rend="sub">g</hi> arise solely from the error in the gradients of the best fit straight lines, and this in turn depends on the scatter in the experimental points which results from the errors in measuring the temperature and resistivity (a function of the resistance, length and area of the samples). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p78.93">A consideration of the magnitudes of the quantities involved shows that the errors in the points depend mainly on the error in the resistivity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p78.93">Although the individual parameter that was most difficult to measure with the most precision was the temperature. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p87.93">The values found and the corresponding values for when the experiment was conducted elsewhere were close. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p87.93">However, the value for K <hi rend="sub">A</hi> was outside experimental uncertainties. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p87.93">It could therefore be said that the systematic errors contributed greatly in this part of the experiment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p87.93">No accepted value for sample <hi rend="bold">B</hi> could be found but it is important to note that the value found is higher than that for sample <hi rend="bold">A</hi>, which would be expected as it is an alloy of copper and tin rather than pure copper, which would decrease its conductivity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p88.93">
<s n="s1.1;p88.93">All the random errors in the experiment have been accounted for by the least square calculation that was performed on the origin software. </s>
</p>
<p n="p89.93">
<s n="s1.6;p89.93">The experimental values for K and E <hi rend="sub">g</hi> need to be corrected for systematic errors. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p89.93">One likely source of this is the fact that the temperature of the samples is measured as the temperature of the oil bath on the assumption that the two are in thermal equilibrium. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p89.93">Although when taking readings a large amount of time was left between measurements there still could have been a temperature difference. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p89.93">As the temperatures were stepped up temperatures being measured were likely to be lower than the actual values. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p89.93">This would have caused the lines of best fit to be shifted down below their true positions on the scatters for samples <hi rend="bold">A</hi> and <hi rend="bold">B</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p89.93">As more readings are taken the difference between the measured and the true temperature increases thus making the gradient of the graph greater and increasing the values of K that were found. </s>
</p>
<p n="p90.93">
<s n="s1.2;p90.93">Another likely source of a systematic error, as mentioned in the introduction, for sample <hi rend="bold">C</hi> is the fact that the energy band gap of semiconductors tends to decrease as the temperature is increased. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p90.93">This behaviour can be better understood if one considers that the inter-atomic spacing increases when the amplitude of the atomic vibrations increases due to the increased thermal energy.<hi rend="sup">[7]</hi> This is going on <hi rend="italic">figure 6</hi> to cause the gradient to increase making the value of E <hi rend="sub">g</hi> found to be too low. </s>
</p>
<p n="p91.93">
<s n="s1.3;p91.93">The main way to improve the accuracy of the results would be to use a method that would make it easier to change the temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p91.93">The use of a fluid which could better transfer the energy to the samples would accomplish this. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p91.93">Also, if more time were available one could perform multiple measurements and then find averaged values. </s>

<p n="p92.93">
<s n="s1.3;p92.93">It was shown that the values for the temperature coefficients for resistivity were similar to known accepted values. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p92.93">For copper an increase in temperature of 1K would increase the resistivity by 5.25x10 <hi rend="sup">-11</hi>Ωm while that for the copper-tin alloy was higher at 1.18x10 <hi rend="sup">-10</hi>Ωm, meaning its resistance was more dependent on its temperature. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p92.93">Values for the interecepts of the two graphs could have been found with the resistivity axis, which one would expect to give the resistivty at 0K. However, the linear relationship that exists at high temperatures breaks down at lower temperatures due to quantum mechanical effects, making the result not very meaningful. </s>

<p n="p93.93">
<s n="s1.3;p93.93">One could extend the experiment further, by analysing what would happen with doped semiconductors. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p93.93">Theory suggests when a semiconductor is doped, a small amount of an element with one more or less electron in the valence shell is added to the semiconductor. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p93.93">This creates additional allowed energy levels in the band gap of the semiconductor. </s>
