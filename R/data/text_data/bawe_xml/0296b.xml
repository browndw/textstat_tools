<head rend="bold">Diagnosing a firm</head>
<p n="p5.46">
<s n="s1.2;p5.46">Before investing or exiting any business, investors need to diagnose a company. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.46">There are very thorough diagnostics tools but also quick ways to assess a business: SWOT<ref target="BAWE_0296b-ftnote.001"/> analysis, Cash Flow analysis and Ratios analysis </s>

<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;pn2.2">OM = Operations Management </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p6.46">
<s n="s1.3;p6.46">SWOT analysis is the first and foremost way to have a good overview of the situations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.46">The SWOT analysis must be done by looking at various functions: management, marketing, operations, finance For example, the SWOT can show that there is no backup (team) but one manager on which the success of a firm relies. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.46">To diversify risks, a life insurance must then be tied to the single manager. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.46">
<s n="s1.6;p7.46">Cash Flow analysis is crucial to decide on the health of a corporate. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.46">A quick way to assess the cash position of a business is to write the cash sources and uses, from which one can assess the most important source and uses. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.46">In CLC case, that pointed us towards Receivables and Inventory issues being financed by Account/Notes payables and Bank short-term loans. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.46">We must always base our analysis on cash flow, NOT accounting. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.46">Cash Flow analysis points directly to what's wrong in the business. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.46">By doing it, we can find another source of funding for long production cycle businesses: e.g. prepayments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.46">
<s n="s1.8;p8.46">Ratios analysis is the third tool applicable. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p8.46">It allows to measure financial issues. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p8.46">However, it is important to know the standard ratios of the industry. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p8.46">In fact, diagnosing ratios (data) should drive our conclusions. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p8.46">There is no need to do ALL the ratios mechanically but one can focus on important and relevant one to provide evidences. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p8.46">Again, managers must know what to expect from those ratios even before running them. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p8.46">For example, a quick way to assess the ROI is to use the rule of thumb called "rule of 72". </s>
<s n="s8.8;p8.46">Also, one can focus on specific months where the balance sheet shows weakness and seek for precision: break down items like profits by unit (cars, seats etc) to better analyse the margins (yield management). </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Business valuation/forecast</head>
<p n="p9.46">
<s n="s1.6;p9.46">Once the diagnostic done, the next step can be valuing the business. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.46">It is very difficult to value a business. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.46">Again, there is no need to start with complexity. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.46">We can go for the "back of the envelope" calculations to value businesses as a first assessment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.46">A simple valuation can be comparing with actual sales within similar industry. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.46">Academic concepts are important but in reality, the firm price is negotiated between the buyer and the seller. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.46">
<s n="s1.5;p10.46">At the Venture Capital cycle (early stages), we can look at revenues/EBIT multiples, even though this is much risky. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.46">These multiples are given by the market (2.5 to 7.5 in general but there are exceptions). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.46">Indeed, we must bear in mind that multiples are conversely proportional to debt costs and a smart seller will always try to maximise earnings before putting the firm on the market. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.46">From observation, the rule is simple for VCs<ref target="BAWE_0296b-ftnote.002"/>: value = Â¼ * (multiple*EBIT<ref target="BAWE_0296b-ftnote.003"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.46">This is because only one out of 4 businesses will be successful. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0296b-ftnote.002">

<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">IT consultancy) </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p11.46">
<s n="s1.7;p11.46">At the Private Equity cycle (later stages), we can look at Adjusted Net Present Values. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.46">As operations (investments in assets) are different from finance (financing in liabilities), the discount rate is dissimilar: WACC for assets (NPV) and cost of debts for financing (interests rates). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.46">For the Adjusted NPV, we will use WACC. However, there is an issue with taxation: the tax is embedded in the interest rates and WACC. We must discount those taxes from the actual rates. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.46">Consistency is crucial to make meaningful figures in the business valuation: use WACC before tax and EBIT OR use WACC and EBIT minus Tax. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.46">Another issue lies on the residual values (equipments). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.46">These residuals must be considered with different options (price level, inflation impact, probability of occurrence). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.46">The rule of thumb is to double the value and discount with the relevant rate before tax. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.46">
<s n="s1.3;p12.46">As these valuations are based on future earnings or cash flows, any financial planning must be "reasonable", with a high-low band including a "most probable" scenario. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.46">We also need to include the funding level, the price changes (inflation). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.46">No matter how wide it is, the gap between budgets versus actual figures is not the best way to measure management qualities </s>

<p n="p13.46">
<s n="s1.4;p13.46">This is the heart of Entrepreneurial Finance. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.46">Businesses should forecast when they will need cash long before running out of it. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.46">For investors, getting out (exiting or harvesting) is as important as getting in (investing). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.46">The exit (harvest) is as important as the entrance in any investment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.46">
<s n="s1.1;p14.46">As fundraising never stops; to be successful, managers must hit their plans. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.46">
<s n="s1.3;p15.46">We must separate Short term and Long Term financing which have different objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.46">While we aim to optimize for long term, we also aim to survive for the short term. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.46">There are exceptions but basically, long/short term liabilities respectively finance long/short term assets<ref target="BAWE_0296b-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p16.46">Once the diagnostic and valuations done, we can think of the acquisition process. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.46">An acquisition has multiple alternatives: acquire &amp; diversify, expand in existing markets, slow growth and take cash from business or sell. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.46">
<s n="s1.1;p17.46">Here, there are two important rules to remember: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.46">
<s n="s1.2;p18.46">By acquiring assets, we have to use the "appropriate" period, discount rates; we should never mingle several decisions (assess buildings and assets lease for example). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.46">The basic question to analyse is "what if we don't go for it?" </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.46">

<p n="p21.46">
<s n="s1.5;p21.46">There are different short-term loans, each with its own positive and negative sides. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.46">Stretching the payables is one way to avoid WC strains but might hurt the relationship with suppliers or customers. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.46">Basically, short-term funding is aimed at financing the WC. For seasonal problems in contrast with secular issues, a short term loan like the revolving credit is required. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.46">Bankers always look at the cash conversion cycle before granting a loan. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.46">Generally, they consider 80% of receivables plus 50% of inventory to quickly assess how much to lend. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.46">
<s n="s1.1;p22.46">When the WC problem is not cyclical but secular, the solution is long term external financing. </s>

<p n="p23.46">

</p>
<p n="p25.46">
<s n="s1.4;p25.46">Lease is another huge source of financing and is often off book. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.46">It can be either on the assets side or the liabilities side. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.46">It allows to expand without tying up capital. </s>
