<p n="p18.52">
<s n="s1.4;p18.52">Once entering solution, the molecules can interact with solvent molecules to help to stabilise these "partial charges" or the polarity of the molecules. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p18.52">By increasing the polarity of the solvent, increases the difference in energy due to the extra stabilisation afforded to the more polar molecule (2-pyridone). </s>
