<s n="s1.8;p1.19">I have chosen to look at these novels because they incorporate mythic and/or fairytale elements, sometimes in similar ways and even to similar ends. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.19">Some are obvious but I have included some ideas that are not explicitly myths/fairytales, and I would like to begin by explaining the choices I have made. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.19">Winterson's novel relies heavily on Biblical ideology, as well as fairytale elements, and is even structured by it, the chapter titles named for biblical books of the Old Testament. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.19">The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'myth' as ' <hi rend="italic">A traditional story, typically involving supernatural beings or forces, which embodies and provides an explanation, aetiology, or justification for something such as the early history of a society, a religious belief or ritual, or a natural phenomenon'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.19">The Old Testament, whilst following the historical story of the Jewish nation searching for freedom, also includes stories that fall under this category, so I will be including references to biblical texts in my analysis. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.19">I will also be including references to Freudian concepts. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.19">The dictionary offers a second definition of the word 'myth' as '<hi rend="italic">A widespread but untrue or erroneous story or belief; a widely held misconception; a misrepresentation of the truth.'</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.001"/> In his time Freud was widely respected as pioneer in psychological studies but many of his ideas have been disproved are and a lot of his research has been dismissed, especially in relationo to sexual theory. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.19">Much of the criticism I have come across refers to them as 'Freudian myths' or 'social myths'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.002"/> and it is for these reasons that I will also be including them in my analysis. </s>

<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.5;p3.19">Uncle Philip is a difficult character to analyse. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.19">On first reading the novel I found him to be one dimensional, and many critics are in agreement, claiming him to be 'less a character than a barely embodied principle'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.004"/> and a 'parody patriarch'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.19">Many critics writing in the 90s view him as so ridiculous that it makes the 'model of dominant masculinity' that he clearly represents seem 'implausible'.<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.006"/> However earlier critics take him as a serious character, placing the relationship between Philip, his puppets and his family as 'symbolic of the control exerted by a partiarchal culture on women and the roles available to them'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.19">This is clearly a feminist assertion, with Uncle Philip as a symbol of a dominant and oppressive patriarchal system. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.19">There are many other ways in which Carter uses fairytale and myth to challenge a male dominated world, what is interesting is that she turns these stories on themselves to point out the ways in which they themselves have constructed the patriarchal society that women find themselves trapped in. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p4.19">The most obvious reference to myth is to Leda and the Swan. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p4.19">On a more serious note, the swan parody juxtaposes romantic, artistic notions of femininity with the very real facts of sexual violence. </s>

<s n="s1.18;p5.19">However Linden Peach also points out that on one level the novel works as a simple reactionary fairytale. </s>
<s n="s2.18;p5.19">Traditionally fairytales were used as cautionary tales, according to Peach, for the 'socialisation of young women'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.18;p5.19">In a way the novel follows this pattern. </s>
<s n="s4.18;p5.19">Melanie believes that because she stole her mother's wedding dress she has somehow caused the death of her parents. </s>
<s n="s5.18;p5.19">This could be seen, in a very simple light, as a warning to little girls that they should be wary of trying to grow up too fast. </s>
<s n="s6.18;p5.19">However the novel begins by going into detail about Melanie's exploration of her own maturing body. </s>
<s n="s7.18;p5.19">Peach points out, correctly in my view, that the novel here is emphasising something that traditional fairytales would have suppressed<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.18;p5.19">Girls in fairytales are generally obedient, virginal figures of purity and they do not feel the excitement which Melanie experiences discovering the changes in her body. </s>
<s n="s9.18;p5.19">In this way Carter is writing her own version of a fairytale, placing a female character at the forefront and pitting her against traditional female roles. </s>
<s n="s10.18;p5.19">Melanie clearly has the intelligence and sexual freedom to take on the male defined visions of feminity which she is constantly pushed into. </s>
<s n="s11.18;p5.19">However Carter does not, arguably make her entirely successful. </s>
<s n="s12.18;p5.19">The Leda and the Swan episode suggests that these roles, though ridiculous and grandiose, are so established that in a sense she must experience them before she can escape them. </s>
<s n="s13.18;p5.19">It appears that she is not strong enough to immediately overthrow them by herself. </s>
<s n="s14.18;p5.19">This poses problems for the novel as a feminist text. </s>
<s n="s15.18;p5.19">As Pauline Palmer suggests it is difficult to 'represent a female protagonist as a victim...while at the same tme portraying her as an autonomous individual." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s16.18;p5.19">When Melanie falls victim to the swan, she falls victim to male dominance. </s>
<s n="s17.18;p5.19">Perhaps Carter is criticising the system but finds that she can offer no alternative? </s>
<s n="s18.18;p5.19">Dworkin suggests that these myths are not 'adequately revisioned' and that Carter fails in her attempt to create a 'female erotic' <ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.014"/> </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.19">One aspect of this failure could be the fact that some critics see Finn as Uncle Philips successor, meaning that even at the end, when Uncle Philip is gone, the system of patriarchy will continue. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p8.19">Jean Wyatt disagrees with this. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p8.19">He claims that Carter 'rewrites Freud's account of a girl's oedipal transformation', exploring the 'pressures exerted to... coerce a girl into accepting the limitations of feminity' but also offering an 'alternative masculinity'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p8.19">Wyatt takes a post-feminist stance by positing Finn as a victim of the patriarchal system too. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p8.19">He claims that Carter takes the Fruedian concept of 'castration' and twists it by having Finn 'castrate' himself, symbolised in his chopping up of the swan '"I dismembered it... </s>

<s n="s6.9;p8.19">Finn thereby forefeits his 'privilege of masculinity'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.018"/> and creates a a different relationship between men and women, in which they are presented as equals. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.19">'Their experience ran parallel'pg173 He quotes John Haffenden saying 'psychological domination is ultimately the failure to recognise the other person as like, although separate from oneself." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.019"/>

<s n="s1.13;p13.19">Jeanette Winterson's novel also uses parody but her target is the Bible. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p13.19">The most obvious use of this is the way that the narrative is structured, using the names of books of the Old Testament to title each chapter. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p13.19">The fact that this book is very autobiographical means that this is not just a cultural reference for Winterson but a personal one too. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p13.19">She takes words which relate to the story of the quest of a nation for its freedom and applies them to individual lives, making light of the grandiose view that the characters have of their own lives and works. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p13.19">Laurel Bollinger goes through each one and points out the parallels between the biblical chapters and Winterson's narrative. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p13.19">Genesis desbcribes Jeanette's origins but does not refer to the many stories within Genesis itself. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p13.19">This is the first of many instances where Winterson clearly takes a story and uses only the details relevant to her story, changing it to fit her argument. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p13.19">However Jeanette's origins do contrast with the 'predominantly male image of creation'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.027"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p13.19">Rather than a loving father, it is Jeanette's mother who has the power of creation for her, her father remains passive. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p13.19">Whether this is positive or negative is hard to say, as Jeanette takes an ambiguous attitude towards her mother. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p13.19">Giving her control of creation makes her appear a strong, capable woman with powerful feelings about her faith. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p13.19">However she uses this strength to reject the daughter she apparently wanted so much, because of her sexuality. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p14.19">Each chapter takes one main element from the Biblical chapter but sometimes Winterson plays with it to fit with her parody. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p14.19">Putting women in traditionally masculine roles is a continuing pattern, and both Carter and Winterson write from a female perspective, using these stories to challenge a tradition in which men are often in positions of power and women must simply obey. </s>

<s n="s2.11;p16.19">She intersperses the chapter with two other fantastical storylines, Winnet Stonejar and Perceval, which means she 'need not respond to the full story'<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.031"/> and there are no direct references to the Bible. </s>

<s n="s5.11;p16.19">Both characters appear to have been abandoned by God yet keep their faith, Jeanette to a lesser extent, and both choose female loyalty when it is the most difficult option for them to take. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p16.19">However Tess Cosslett suggests that Winterson is not making such a specific comparison, that she is 'veering away from a close parallel... using the name only to refer generally to strong themes of loneliness and woman identification." </s>

<s n="s7.11;p16.19">She also makes comment on the parts of the story that Winterson leaves out. </s>

<s n="s9.11;p16.19">Cosslett interprets this as the 'effect that her lebianism has had on the stereotypical feminine story' leaving the novel with a sense of 'loss....hope and absence of closure." </s>

<s n="s10.11;p16.19">This may well be true.The roles of hereosexual wife and mother are ones which are not open to Jeanette, however even in stories such as Ruth, which many have cited as feminist because of the focalisation of female characters, these roles are the only ones avaiable for female fulfilment. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p16.19">Jeanette has no traditional model to follow, but the strong message of female loyalty in Ruth is something she can identify with and search for, even if she is unsure of ever finding it 'I knew a woman in another place...what if she sleepwalked beside me and I never knew?'pg171<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.034"/>. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p17.19">The sense of homessickness is evident, as is the inevitability of their choices 'could have turned back'pg 161 'he dreams...of his stables and his faithful friends', and reference to being 'pulled like a bobbin' echoes comments made by Jeanette about her feelings towards her mother 'she had a thread around my button to tug when she pleased.' </s>
<s n="s6.9;p17.19">The father in the Winnet sequence is clearly wicked, but for Perceval Arthur is a figure to which he is attached, showing again Jeanette's mixed feelings. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p17.19">The fact that Perceval is male puts a new perspective on Jeanette's experience, some critics claim it makes the experience more universal<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.035"/>, in the same way that the Winnet Stonejar sequence does by using a father figure condemning the protagonist for having feelings for a boy. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p17.19">However even though Perceval is male, suggesting Jeanette's identification with masculinity, this male hero is feminised 'He was a warrior who longed to grow herbs'pg161. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0224a-ftnote.036"/>
<s n="s2.8;p18.19">Ruth involves roles which are inappropriate to her character, so she leaves them out; the quest for the grail is far to complex for her to appropriate altogether, what she is interested in is the quest element and the relationship with a parental figure, Arthur representing her mother. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p18.19">For Palmer the fantasy sections of the novel empasise the part that storytelling and fantasy play in the construction of the psyche, allowing Jeanette to escape the world of fundamentalist oppresion to a simpler realm, where she is not a victim and has more control. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p18.19">She also says that by revising stories, 'she challenges the patriarchal values associated with the genre [fairytale]' and contrasts her approach directly with Carter's 'Carter's stories portray the girl accomodating to hereosexual relations... </s>
