<s n="s3.4;p9.26">With regards to retrieval, it has been demonstrated that stress can increase the recall of a memory to a point, however when this becomes too intense there is often a decrease in performance.<ref target="BAWE_0411a-ftnote.012"/> The adversarial process often requires witnesses to give evidence a long time after an event has taken place and unquestionably places witnesses under great pressure when giving evidence. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p11.26">Such treatment of witnesses must surely contravene the principle of justice as fairness and it should be questioned whether a witness should be subject to this stress and anxiety when effectively serving the criminal justice system. </s>
