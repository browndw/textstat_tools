<p n="p1.65">
<s n="s1.1;p1.65">The aim of the following project is to discover what is currently required for a UK food retailer to be successful. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.65">
<s n="s1.1;p2.65">It will include an exploration of the strategies and techniques employed by Tesco that have led to their recent prosperity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.65">
<s n="s1.3;p3.65">Tesco assumed the position of leading food retailer from Sainsbury in the mid 1990's (Anon, retail property website) and have since continued to dominate the oligopoly, this year on course to make a record Â£2 billion pound in profits (BBC1 News) with sales up more than 7.5% on last years. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.65">The company currently operates more than 1,878 stores in the UK with a further 81 opening this year (BBC News). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.65">Tesco has branched out to provide a range of services from financial to telecom, now also the UK's leading online retailer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.65">
<s n="s1.3;p4.65">Within the food retailing oligopoly, competition is strong and strategic. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.65">Stores look to each other for guidance and often try to predict their competitors' plans. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.65">It is therefore important to bare in mind that the recent success of Tesco is relative to its competitors, meaning that it may not only have come about due to its own improvements but also due to opponents downfalls, for example Sainsbury who have suffered greatly in the last few years. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.65">
<s n="s1.1;p5.65">In order to address this aim the following objectives will be answered: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.65">
<s n="s1.1;p6.65">Who are the leading retail chains? </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.65">
<s n="s1.1;p7.65">How marketing strategies differ between stores and the extent to which the most successful have aided in Tesco's recent prosperity. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.65">
<s n="s1.1;p8.65">How e-retailing schemes differ between stores and whether this has had a profound affect in Tesco's dominance. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Marketing strategies</head>
<p n="p9.65">
<s n="s1.2;p9.65">Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of any company is understanding the nature and needs of their customers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.65">The '<hi rend="italic">Marketing mix</hi>' (Borden 1964, cited in Brassington and Pettitt, 2000, p.23-28) is used to illustrate how this can be put into practise effectively. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.65">
<s n="s1.1;p10.65">The marketing mix consists of four major marketing tools; product, price, promotion and place. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Product:</head>
<p n="p11.65">
<s n="s1.1;p11.65">A successful product in the food retailing industry requires initial innovation, effective management, continual differentiation from competitors, attractive packaging and clear benefits. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.65">
<s n="s1.1;p12.65">It would be very difficult to compare and contrast all products from different retailers; however, stores own brand ranges are designed to reflect the company's core values so would provide a representative comparison. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.65">
<s n="s1.2;p13.65">The companies that produce own-brand products for the supermarkets have very low overheads so the retailers can afford to keep prices low and still make a profit. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.65">Therefore own branding is a good investment both for retailers and customers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.65">
<s n="s1.2;p14.65">Tesco own brand range cleverly targets a wide range of differing needs with its contrasting slogans, '<hi rend="italic">Tesco value'</hi> and '<hi rend="italic">Tesco's finest'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.65">Both are cheap, have distinctive packaging and target appropriate consumers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.65">
<s n="s1.4;p15.65">Asda own brand range follows the store's famous '<hi rend="italic">Asda price'</hi> slogan with very low prices reflected in the packaging which is kept minimal but sufficient enough to prevent damage to the product. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.65">The packaging is very plain, usually white or transparent to save costs. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.65">This can have two affects on the consumer. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.65">From one perspective the customer could see the product as diminished in quality due to the low price and unattractive packaging, or on the other hand, the minimal cost packaging may serve the purpose of the low price therefore not affecting the quality of the product itself. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.65">
<s n="s1.5;p16.65">Waitrose own brand range is typically much more expensive than its competitors but is thought to be of exclusive quality which gives differentiation to the brand. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.65">Packaging tends to be much more elaborate and eye catching, and to those who can afford the premium prices, very appealing. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.65">Perhaps one of the reasons why Waitrose is not as successful as Tesco is because only a small market is targeted. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.65">John Lewis who own Waitrose have their own farms where all their food is grown. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.65">This exclusive practise provides assured quality and traceability increasing customer loyalty but only to those who can afford it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.65">
<s n="s1.5;p17.65">Sainsbury own brand features somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.65">Like Tesco, Sainsbury also attempts to target a wider market with its '<hi rend="italic">Be good to yourself range</hi>' alongside Sainsbury's own products. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.65">This range creates differentiation for the company and is very much in tune with consumers' lifestyles. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.65">The packaging is attractive, promoting quality and healthy living, both very appealing to a section of the population. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.65">Sainsbury's own products on the other hand take the same characteristics as Tesco value and Asdas '<hi rend="italic">smart price'</hi> range but at a slightly higher price. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.65">
<s n="s1.4;p18.65">From the above analysis it seems that Tesco and Sainsbury have the most effective product ranges in recognising that there are different types of consumers to be targeted using separate techniques. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.65">This fundamental aspect of marketing is known as segmentation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.65">Consumers differ in their needs and wants for a product or service and as it would be impractical, impossible and too expensive to custom make products for each individual in the market, consumers are split into groups with similar needs and attitudes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.65">A profile of this particular group is created and they are then targeted with specific messages relevant to their requirements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.65">
<s n="s1.2;p19.65">In 2002 Sainsbury analysed their customer segments based on reward card data. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.65">They sectioned their customers into the following groups and subgroups: </s>
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>Family orientated</item>
<item>Less affluent family</item>
<item>New family</item>
<item>Typical family</item>
<item>Low contribution</item>

<item>Organics</item>
<item>Foodies</item>
<item>Time poor/cash rich</item>
<item>Health conscious (Rosalind Warren, marketing lecturer)</item>
</list>
<p n="p20.65">
<s n="s1.1;p20.65">The information gained from the reward cards allows Sainsbury to identify the growing segments in the market (which ones have brought them the most profit) and adjust their stocks, products and promotions to more specifically target these people. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Price:</head>
<p n="p21.65">
<s n="s1.4;p21.65">In the food retailing oligopoly the retailers have a slight monopoly over the manufacturers in that they have the power to set the market price of goods. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.65">Consumer perception has to be thought about in the pricing of goods. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.65">A low price can be perceived as poor quality while a high price could be undercut by competitors wanting to steal market share. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.65">Most low cost retailers such as Asda and Tesco set low prices but avoid the association of diminished quality by offering discounts on bulk buys only, so the consumer will then think that the lower price is due to bulk purchasing and no longer associate it with the quality of the product. </s>

<p n="p23.65">
<s n="s1.2;p23.65">The actual differences in these prices, however, are not given by this table so it is difficult to gauge how much cheaper the products are. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.65">In most cases as with the example below the differences are minimal but if consistent throughout a store can contribute to a considerable saving on a weekly shop. </s>

<p n="p25.65">

<p rend="bulleted" n="p58.65">
<s n="s1.1;p58.65">Tesco has expanded its range of non-food merchandise to keep the lowest food prices in the market. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p62.65">This last point is perhaps the most important, particularly for the future of the company as the current retail oligopoly is driven by the consumer. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p63.65">Further quantifiable research is needed to ascertain the suggestions made in this project. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p63.65">A more in depth study of Sainsbury's and other competitor's downfalls would help to provide an idea of Tesco's success relative to its environment. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p65.65">It would also be interesting to extend this project to an international level as from the research conducted it is apparent that globalisation is also an area that has aided in Tesco's dominance. </s>
