<div1 type="front text">
<p rend="bulleted">Green introduces the idea of a potential function, defined as the sum of all electric particles acting on a given point divided by their respective distances from the point. This potential function represents the forces acting on the electrified body, which drive forward the particles. He introduces some key notation and calculates the Laplacian of the potential function both inside and outside of the body.</p>
<p rend="bulleted">As a result of electric repulsion, the charge distributed on a body, for a system of perfectly conducting bodies in equilibrium, occurs only on the surface of the body with none remaining in the interior</p>
<p rend="bulleted">He provides an elegant proof for a theorem, a useful tool for later in the paper:</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0323b-form.001"/>
</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0323b-form.002"/>
</p>
<p>He also extends this formula for bodies which have singularities, a term which he defines as points where the function U or V(or both) become infinite.</p>
<p rend="bulleted">Demonstrates, in the form of an example, how the form of the potential function changes suddenly when passing from a space inside the body to the outside. Taking functions V and V', he proves that if they satisfy some set conditions then it is possible to assign only one value of ρ which will produce them.</p>
<p rend="bulleted">Following on from the previous result, when the value of the potential function is known on any closed surface there is only one function, V, which can satisfy both ∆V = 0 and have no singularities in the interior of the body. Then, introducing the condition that V'=0 at an infinite distance from the surfaces, this can be extended to the exterior of a number of closed spaces.</p>
<p rend="bulleted">For a closed surface which is a perfect conductor, the potential function, arising from the surface only, does not depend on which point in the surface the electricity is concentrated at. This result is independent of the number of conducting bodies.</p>
<p rend="bulleted">The amount of charge on the surface of a body with charge spread in its interior as well as on its surface, i.e. not a perfect conductor, can be calculated simply by finding out the value of the potential function outside of the body.</p>
