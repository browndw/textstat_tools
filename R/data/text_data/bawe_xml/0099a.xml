<s n="s1.5;p7.21">If the central bank decides to increase money supply by printing more money and put it to circulation through open-market operations buying the earlier issued government bonds, the LM curve should shift down. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p7.21">People are indifferent between holding bonds and cash, and even though the proportion of bonds in relation to cash in people's portfolios would increase, it would not be able to reduce interest rates any further. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.21">Other way to express this is that, the interest sensitivity of money demand tends to infinity, i.e. as interest rates cannot fall any further, there can be no boost to investment from monetary expansion and hence no increase in consumption either. <ref target="BAWE_0099a-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.21">If we relax the assumption of the economy being closed, we can have another solution for the problem. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p12.21">If the central bank increases money supply, this should in principle decrease the demand for the domestic currency and as a result it would depreciate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.21">This depreciation would make the domestic goods cheaper abroad thus increasing the demand for domestic goods. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p13.21">Hence the monetary policy would be effective again. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.21">However, as noted in Blanchard, the depreciation of the currency happens through the interest parity relation, increase in money supply shifts the LM curve down and as a result the domestic interest rate falls resulting in currency depreciation<ref target="BAWE_0099a-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.21">In the case where interest rates are already close to zero, depreciation could therefore be difficult, even impossible, to achieve and the effect on relative prices would not take place. </s>
