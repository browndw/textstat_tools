<s n="s1.9;p2.8">One can gain a basic understanding of Realism, Liberalism and Marxism by contrasting the 'essential elements' of these ideologies. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p2.8">The additional beliefs that human nature is fundamentally war-like and that all states are potentially dangerous means that states will strive to gain power relative to each-other; this creates an unpredictable international environment that Kenneth Waltz has called a 'self-help system'<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.8">Whereas Realism therefore "paints a rather grim picture of world politics"<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.005"/>, Liberal notions convey a significantly more optimistic view. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.8">The numerous strands of Liberalism hold that human nature is basically good, and that the interest of the state is bound up with that of its people; furthermore, states are capable of cooperation in a system where international institutions are essential actors. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.8">Unlike Realism which considers only relative gains in world politics, Liberalism stresses the importance of interdependence as a means of achieving gains in absolute terms<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.8">Finally, the Marxist representation of the international system is one dominated not by states but by classes, where capitalist modes of production and class struggle shape political outcomes. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.8">Economics plays a crucial part in this system, as the tensions between capitalists and workers<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.007"/> catalyse social transformation<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.008"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.8">As a student of world politics seeking a straightforward understanding of the international system, I can begin to evaluate these rival ideologies in a purely pragmatic manner by comparing the relative parsimony of each world view. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.8">Realism offers an attractively simple conception of international relations that may explain its ongoing popularity in political analysis: it maintains that states are unitary, rational, and self-interested actors which will behave in the interests of national survival<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.8">By contrast, Liberalism encompasses numerous sub-state and non-state actors into its analysis, and argues that moral and humanitarian factors also influence state behaviour, which creates a more complex and possibly more normative view of the international system. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.8">Marxism, on the other hand, facilitates one's comprehension of international relations by relying on a concise representation of international relations dynamics: the materialistic base-superstructure model. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.8">According to this model, societal transformation originates from the tension between means and relations of production (respectively, the proletariat and the bourgeoise); this forms an economic base, which in turn determines a superstructure of legal, political and cultural institutions<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.8">However, the Frankfurt School's attempts to analyse the social world as a totality by considering notions such as culture and philosophy has complicated later strands of Marxist analysis<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.8">Thus, in evaluating Realism, Liberalism and Marxism simply in the interest of parsimony, I may privilege the uncomplicated Realist explanation of international relations. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p4.8">In evaluating these theories, I must therefore also consider the possibility that these ideologies rely on unviable assumptions. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.8">While its simplicity is appealing, Realism has been criticised for offering a "one-dimensional"<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.012"/> interpretation of state behaviour: it rejects the influence of non-power motivations or of non-state actors in the decision-making process. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.8">Furthermore, by defining power solely in terms of resources, this world view ignores the significance of power capabilities and of ideological power, which Waltz and Hobbes both see as a substantial omission<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.8">While less clearly simplistic, the assumptions of Liberalism may also misrepresent the international system through a utopian belief in man's possibilities of intellectual, moral, and social improvement. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.8">Liberal institutionalism, in particular, sees a 'natural order' underlying human society, a notion that even the Idealist strand considers unlikely<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.8">Certain Marxist conjectures appear similarly implausible. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.8">Particularly, Marxism relies on the existence of an ongoing tension between capitalist and working classes. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.8">According to Herbert Marcuse, however, the masses may no longer be capable of undertaking emancipatory revolution, as "one-dimensional man" has been integrated into the capitalist system and is now unable to envisage an alternative to this status-quo<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.015"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p5.8">Nevertheless, these world views may still offer insightful explanations of past state interactions; an alternative approach to evaluating them is to investigate the degree to which each ideology succeeds in explaining historical occurrences. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.8">According to Mearsheimer, numerous political episodes coincide with a Realist understanding of state behaviour. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.8">For example, Realist relative-gains considerations were central to determining Cold War foreign policy tactics<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.8">Mearsheimer also uses the historical record to attack Liberal ideology: based on the failure of the League of Nations in maintaining peace after 1914, he undermines the claim that international institutions can maintain collective security<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.8">However, I do not believe that these examples necessarily demonstrate Realism's supremacy over the other world views: more recent developments, such as NATO's 1999 intervention in Kosovo on a humanitarian basis, are better explained from a Liberal than a Realist perspective<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.018"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.8">The historical accuracy of Marxist theories is also open to debate. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.8">Gramsci's theory of hegemony offers a convincing explanation of the failure of the Second International<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.019"/> by arguing that leaders of post-1918 revolutions did not foster a sufficiently close relationship with the classes they represented<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.020"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.8">On the other hand, the fact that Marx's forecast of the fall of capitalism was followed by an era of Neo-Liberalism does not testify to the accuracy of Marxism in predicting international relations. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.8">In conclusion, the three dominant theories of international relations can be contrasted in terms of their theoretical basis, their ability to explain the political past, and their possible relevance in the contemporary world order. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.8">However, no single ideology emerges from this analysis as dominantly efficacious for the student of world politics. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.8">While Realism appeals to me through its simplicity, the reductionism of its assumptions undermine its analytical power; each world view has both strengths and weaknesses in terms of the historical record; and my choice of Marxism as the most accurate portrayal of the current international system remains a largely subjective one. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.8">We may achieve a more enlightening understanding of the international system not by viewing it not in the framework of a single world view, but rather through a synthesis of these three complementary and historically contingent ideologies. </s>
