<s n="s1.3;p6.13">Without a higher concept of personhood, Strawson points out that it is just as coherent to suggest that there are a whole series of minds transmitting their state and consciousness from one to the other as to think that there is only a single mind. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p7.13">It is this claim that Foster confronts in his book <hi rend="italic">The Immaterial Self: A defence of the Cartesian Dualism Conception of Mind</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.13">In order to define a person independently of anything other than mind he writes that the essential nature of a non-physical 'basic subject' (which can be taken to mean person) must be a purely mental attribute that it necessarily possesses at every point in its history. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.13">It must be sufficiently broad so as to be a constant feature throughout the subject's widely varying mental conditions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.13">
<s n="s1.2;p8.13">Descartes thought this property was the <hi rend="italic">cogitatio</hi>, but the varying ways in which this word can be interpreted will alter the argument significantly. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.13">If it is taken to mean simply 'thought' then Foster points out that it is not sufficiently generic as to cover all of our mental activity: it is just one of a group of mental states and not its common factor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.13">
<s n="s1.3;p9.13">If it is interpreted as meaning 'consciousness' then it cannot be an attribute that is necessarily possessed at every point in a person's existence because a subject is not conscious when asleep or under Anaesthesia. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.13">If the Cartesian insists that consciousness is the essential attribute of personhood he must make a choice between two alternatives. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.13">Either there is a constant stream of consciousness during sleep of which we have no memory, or we cease to exist as people when we are asleep or otherwise unconscious. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.13">
<s n="s1.8;p10.13">In light of this it seems the meaning of <hi rend="italic">cogitatio</hi> must be expanded further to mean simply 'mentality', i.e. all mental activity. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p10.13">But is this the 'unitary intrinsic attribute' that Foster was looking for, or simply a disjunction of all the states it covers? </s>
<s n="s3.8;p10.13">There must be a common factor that binds them, something in virtue of which they all qualify as mental. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p10.13">Descartes identified this common factor as the ability to all be accessible to introspective awareness when the subject is conscious<ref target="BAWE_0294d-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.13">In this case a mind is more like a rope. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p10.13">There are many mental processes taking place through time, like the many threads that make up a rope. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p10.13">They overlap with each other and vary in size, without any single process, or thread, lasting for the entire length. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.13">They are united by our introspective awareness of them. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p11.13">It is interesting to note that Descartes does not suggest memory as the answer to the problem of continued identity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.13">The majority of his illustrations are snapshots of the mind at a single point, without any real consideration for its continuity. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.13">Surely, if anything, it is our memory that assures us that we remain the same person, and allows for any conception of continuity at all. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.13">Perhaps the answer lies in Descartes's attributing the same level of doubt to memory as to perception of the external world. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.13">Nothing so doubtful can be relied on to guarantee our identity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.13">
<s n="s1.3;p12.13">However Descartes's <hi rend="italic">cogitatio</hi> is defined, the whole notion of defining personhood solely with reference to mental activity raises problems. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.13">A baby has very little brain activity, and is certainly not capable of 'introspective awareness', whilst a very early foetus has no brain activity at all. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.13">And yet many people will argue that both of these, certainly the former, are persons. </s>

<p n="p13.13">
<s n="s1.6;p13.13">We seem to have no problem identifying what we think are people. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.13">But it soon becomes clear that many of our seemingly natural judgements do not stand up to analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.13">Generally we will combine an individual mind and body in order to come up with our idea of a person. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.13">Whether either of these on its own still constitutes a person remains a matter of debate. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.13">If forced to make a choice, we would most likely say it is the mental processes and personality that define a person rather than their body, hence the belief among many that a person continues to exist after the death of their body. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.13">But as has been shown, it is very difficult to pinpoint which of the multitude of mental states, if any, constitutes who we really are. </s>
