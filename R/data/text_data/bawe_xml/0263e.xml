<p>The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC. Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<p n="p2.73">
<s n="s1.2;p2.73">Due to the technological developments in telecommunications in recent years, the need for new methods of maintaining security and privacy over insecure communication media has emerged. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.73">This is usually achieved through using some form of data encryption. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.73">
<s n="s1.2;p3.73">Data encryption involves taking some type of data (in computer communications, generally in binary form) and in some way altering it so that only the intended recipient - and possibly also the sender - can work out what the original data was. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.73">The alteration generally involves either rearranging the characters in the data, or replacing certain characters with other characters, or may involve a combination of both of these. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.73">
<s n="s1.2;p4.73">Encryption algorithms can be split into two general categories: block ciphers (which encrypt multiple characters at a time) and steam ciphers (which encrypt data character by character). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.73">There are many different algorithms within these categories, and often even different ways of implementing the basic algorithms, which leads to a huge array of choices for any given application. </s>
