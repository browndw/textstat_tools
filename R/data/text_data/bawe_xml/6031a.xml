<s n="s1.4;p38.46">According to França (1994), "an integral aspect of the workshop delivered by ISNAR is the ultimate application of the skills learned by the participants in the work environment". </s>
<s n="s2.4;p38.46">The participant action plan approach (PAPA) was developed by the United States Office of Personnel Management to help participants of short term training to apply lessons learned during training to their job sites. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p38.46">Participants reflect on and list possible actions based on their new knowledge, at the end of the workshop, leaving the event with a concrete plan to be implemented, when resources are available. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p40.46">The current approach undertaken by ISNAR is entirely based on the experimental learning proposed by Kolb. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p40.46">But not all writers agree with Kolb's theory. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p40.46">Rogers, for example points out that "learning includes goals, purposes, intentions, choice and decision-making, and it is not at all clear where these elements fit into the learning cycle" (Rogers, 1996:108). </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.46">
<s n="s1.2;p41.46">According to Jeffs and Smith (1999), a number of criticisms can be made of the Kolb model. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.46">It pays insufficient attention to the process of reflection (see Boud et al 1985); the claims made for the four different learning styles are extravagant (Jarvis 1987; Tennant 1997); the model takes very little account of different cultural experiences/conditions; the idea of stages or steps does not sit well with the reality of thinking (Dewey 1933); and the empirical support for the model is weak (Jarvis 1987; Tennant 1997). </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.46">
<s n="s1.2;p42.46">Loynes (1998) indicates that Kolb's theory is based on research measuring the non-conscious development of psycho-motor skills. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p42.46">According to the author, the evidence that other kinds of learning follow this pattern is weak. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.46">
<s n="s1.3;p43.46">Even thou the current approach undertaken by ISNAR receive critiques from the literature, the approach has been successfully disseminated among researchers from developing world, as one of the most successful approach in the CGIAR, based on its capacity to develop skills among the workshop participants. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p43.46">Based on its training-of-trainers methodology, the skills gained can be disseminated at low costs within several developing countries organization. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p43.46">The phase beyond the ToT workshop requires some considerations, as indicated in the next section. </s>
</p>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Suggestions for Improvement</head>
<p n="p44.46">
<s n="s1.3;p44.46">The final stage of experimental cycle, 'application' is often left out by ISNAR when designing the programmes. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p44.46">As a result, the power of experiential learning is significantly diminished or negated altogether. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p44.46">In other to be more effective, ISNAR will need to work closely with the trainees when they return to their own environment, supporting the implementation of the PAPA and the phase beyond the ToT workshop. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.46">
<s n="s1.3;p45.46">The implications or constraints for such action will be mainly personnel time and costs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p45.46">ISNAR will need to identify subject matter specialists, on the topic the trainee was trained on, and organize visits to the trainee region, for face-to-face interaction. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p45.46">Through those close interaction, it is expected that the trainee will be empowered to make her/his own decisions when applying a new knowledge and the process can be institutionalized and sustainable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.46">
<s n="s1.2;p46.46">However there are investments in education, the stigma that short term training are exclusively an opportunity to networking, in order words, to bring professional from different places to have 'a good time', is still strong. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p46.46">There is a need to change the attitudes and behaviour of professionals linked to training and capacity strengthening, in order to raise awareness of the importance of developing skills among professionals and change curriculum at university and vocational training level for improving life conditions of poor countries. </s>
