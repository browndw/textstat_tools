<s n="s2.7;p3.11">Simply changing the column of stationary phase can access different methods of HPLC. Each column is also compatible with several solvent systems allowing the method to be refined to achieve the best possible separation and resolution. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.11">One of the most common methods is adsorption chromatography. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.11">In principle it is very similar to thin-layer chromatography (TLC), a polar material with a high specific surface area, such as silica, is used as a stationary phase with a non-polar mobile phase (eluent), such as hexane.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Another popular method of HPLC is reversed-phase chromatography. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.11">This is essentially the reverse of adsorption chromatography, with a non-polar stationary phase and polar mobile phase. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.11">There are two models of retention that define its mechanism: the solvent-interaction model by Scott and Kucera in 1979 and the solvent-competition model by Snyder in 1968 and 1983.<ref target="BAWE_0388d-endnote.004"/> Both assume that a layer of solvent molecules, which interact strongly with the stationary phase, is adsorbed onto the surface of the stationary phase. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.11">This restricts the interactions between the stationary phase and the analyte molecules, causing them to rapidly elute from the system.<ref target="BAWE_0388d-endnote.005"/> In the solvent-interaction model the analyte molecule is partitioned between the mobile phase and the layer of adsorbed solvent molecules. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.11">The solvent-competition model has the analyte molecules competing with the strong solvent molecules for active sites in the stationary phase. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.11">However, both models assume that the interactions between a certain analyte and the stationary phase remain constant. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.11">Therefore, it must be concluded that retention is determined by the composition of the mobile phase for any particular stationary phase. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.11">If both models have the same outcome it must be presumed that they are equivalent to another. </s>
