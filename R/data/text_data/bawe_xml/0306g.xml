<p n="p2.46">
<s n="s1.2;p2.46">In order for a gamma ray that has been emitted from an excited nuclear state, to be absorbed into an identical nuclear state it must have exactly the same transition energy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.46">This process is known as resonant absorption. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.46">
<s n="s1.8;p3.46">Under normal circumstances, as a nucleus emits this γ-ray, it recoils as a result of conservation of energy. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.46">The emitted gamma ray therefore has less energy than the transition that produced it, and this energy is less than the natural line width necessary for photon absorption to occur. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.46">The Mössbauer effect describes the particular cases in which the nuclei are effectively 'recoil-less' and the gamma ray can once again be absorbed. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.46">The radiation can be supplied with the exact amount of energy necessary by two common methods. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.46">Firstly, the nuclei can be frozen into a crystal lattice with low states of vibration, and hence the recoil energy will be effectively reduced to zero. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.46">The second method, that will be made use of in this experiment, is to Doppler broaden the gamma ray spectrum so that there is a possibility of resonant absorption in another atom. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.46">This is achieved by varying <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, the velocity of the source relative to the absorber which, in turn, increases the kinetic energy of the gamma ray. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.46">This effectively cancels out the effect of the recoil and the gamma ray now has enough energy to be within the natural line width, and will be absorbed into similar nuclei <hi rend="bold">[1].</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.46">
<s n="s1.4;p4.46">If we place a certain material (absorber) in between a gamma ray emitter of a particular energy, and a detector, we will produce a spectrum that shows at which energy some of the gamma rays were absorbed into that material. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.46">If the detector were of infinite resolution efficiency, the line on this spectrum would represent a Dirac delta function, but instead it will appear as a Lorentzian curve where that line would be. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.46">The full width at half maximum height (FWHM) divided by the height of the Lorenztian (ΔΕ/Ε) will compute to give the error in the detector resolution. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.46">

<s n="s1.3;p5.46">This principle of photon absorption is the basis for determining the hyperfine structures of different materials. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.46">There are three main quantum mechanical effects known as hyperfine interactions that distort the picture as shown in <hi rend="italic">figure 1.1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.46">These effects will split energy levels within the nuclei and hence will split the lines that appear on the spectrum where the gamma rays have been absorbed. </s>

<head rend="bold">1.2.1 Isomer Shift</head>
<p n="p6.46">
<s n="s1.3;p6.46">The isomer shift is caused by the non-infinitesimal volume of the nucleus and the electron charge density due to the s-electrons within it. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.46">S-orbitals have a maximum electron density centred at the nucleus and therefore have a large effect on the overall charge density of the nucleus (see <hi rend="italic">figure 1.2</hi>). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.46">Any differences between the s-electrons in the source and in the sample result in a monopole (Coulomb) interaction changing the nuclear energy levels and hence a shift in the Mössbauer absorption lines. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0306g-pic.001">

<p n="p7.46">
<s n="s1.2;p7.46">The first factor to be considered is the total number of s-electrons present. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.46">Any change in valency or configuration, resulting in a change in the total number of s-electrons, will result in a significant isomer shift. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.46">
<s n="s1.7;p8.46">Another main factor contributing to the isomer shift regards the density of the non s-electrons. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.46">This is because the wave function of an s-electron is not independent of the number and type of other electrons in the same atom. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.46">The electron density of the p, d, f etc. electrons influences the spatial distribution of the s-electrons on the same atom by inter-electronic repulsion, and the amplitudes of s-electron wavefunctions at the nucleus are therefore dependent on electron densities elsewhere in the atom. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.46">The p, d, f etc. electrons are said to "shield" the s-electrons from the nucleus. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.46">Consider, for example, the electron configurations of Fe <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> and Fe <hi rend="sup">3+</hi> which are (3d)<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and (3d)<hi rend="sup">5</hi> respectively. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.46">The ferrous (Fe <hi rend="sup">2+</hi>) have fewer s-electrons at the nucleus due to the greater screening of the d-electrons. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.46">Hence the ferrous ions have a greater positive isomer shifts than the ferric (Fe <hi rend="sup">3+</hi>) ions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.46">
<s n="s1.1;p9.46">The isomer shift δ (mms <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>) can be found from the spectra as the difference of the energy peak(s) from the zero velocity point, as shown in <hi rend="italic">figure 1.3</hi>. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p10.46">Therefore ρ is always an even function. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p10.46">A nuclear dipole moment is not allowed because it means that there would have to be an inversion through the coordinate centre, a coordinate system which is centro-symmetric (i.e it is not an even function). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p10.46">However a quadrupole moment is allowed with this system, because it has a charge density which is symmetrical with respect to inversion through the centre (an even function). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p10.46">This does not mean that there are negative charges on the nucleus, just a non spherical charge distribution. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p10.46">This asymmetric electric field (produced by an asymmetric electronic charge distribution or ligand arrangement) splits the nuclear energy levels. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p10.46">The quantity describing this charge distribution is known a as the Electric Field Gradient (EFG). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p10.46">EFG's are generated at a nucleus whenever the symmetry is less than cubic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.46">
<s n="s1.4;p11.46">The interaction between a nuclear quadrupole and an EFG is quantised, splitting the nuclear energy levels without removing the degeneracy remains in states with the same spin M <hi rend="sub">I</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.46">In the case of <hi rend="sup">57</hi>Fe the ground state has a spin of ½, whilst the excited state at 14.4 keV has a spin of 3/2. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.46">The EFG does not effect the ground state, however it splits the excited state into sub-states with M <hi rend="sub">I</hi> = ±3/2 and M <hi rend="sub">I</hi> = ±1/2 removing the degeneracy between the sub-states. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.46">This is observed as a "quadrupole split" in the Mössbauer spectrum corresponding to the energy difference between the sub-states (<hi rend="italic">figure 1.4</hi>). </s>

<p n="p12.46">
<s n="s1.3;p12.46">EFG's at nuclear sites can be generated by charges in the lattice of those of the atom itself. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.46">For a closed-shell (i.e full outer shell) atom EFG's are generated in non-cubic structures, in the octahedral site of a cubic lattice the symmetry is such that an EFG is not produced. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.46">EFG's also produced by open-shell atoms, once each orbital has been allocated an electron (spherically symmetric case) the next electron joins one of the orbitals with opposite spin (Pauli Exclusion Principle) creating a non-spherically symmetric charge distribution and hence an electric field gradient. </s>
