<s n="s3.3;p2.26">The hydrolysis of the peptide/amide bonds is specific and occurs between amino acids containing large hydrophobic side chains; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan in proteins <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.26">
<s n="s1.4;p3.26">Peptide and amide bonds in proteins and synthetic ester substrates are hydrolysed by an acylenzyme mechanism i.e. by a covalent bound intermediate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.26">The first stage of which is that of the enzyme and substrate form a non-covalent enzyme-substrate complex held together by the physical force of attraction between the two particles. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.26">The hydroxyl group of Ser-195 located in the active site of the enzyme attacks the carbonyl group of the substrate (nucleophilic attack) to form the acyl-enzyme releasing the amine or alcohol. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.26">The acyl-enzyme intermediate is then hydrolysed, releasing the carboxylic acid component of the substrate resulting in the regeneration of the 'free' enzyme <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.26">
<s n="s1.5;p4.26">Chymotrypsin contains a series of sub-sites across its surface onto which the polypeptide substrate can bind; there is no well defined cleft or groove for substrate binding. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.26">With the exception of the primary binding site which the side chains of aromatic amino acids on the substrate can fit. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.26">The biding pocket is a well defined slit 10-12Å deep, 3.5 to 4 by 5.5 to 6.5Å in cross section, these dimensions provide a pocket which provides a snug fit around an aromatic ring (6Å wide to 3.5Å thick). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.26">The pocket is lined with non-polar amino acids thus provides a suitable environment for the binding of non-polar or hydrophobic side chains of the substrate <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.26">The binding of a suitable side chain in to this slit positions the adjacent peptide bond into the active site for cleavage <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.2;p5.26">The reactivity of Serine-195 is due to the attachment of the imidazole ring of histidine-57 which is also hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate of Asp-102 forming a catalytic triad. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.26">The key reason is that histidine polarizes the hydroxyl group of serine therefore generating an alkoxide ion which is a stronger nucleophile than that of the hydroxyl group attached to serine <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.26">Hartley and Kilby examined the catalysis by chymotrypsin of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.26">The product of the catalysis (PNP-), is bright yellow with a strong absorbance at 400nm allowing the reaction to be followed at great ease spectrophotometrically. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.26">When PNPA is present in large excess the release of PNP- is linear with time (Figure 1), however if this linear line is extrapolated back to time zero it does not extrapolate to zero absorbance. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.26">This is since the hydrolysis of PNPA proceeds with an initial 'burst' of p-Nitrophenolate release followed by the slow zero-order release of product. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.26">The biphasic release of product implied a two step reaction mechanism, the burst face was a stochiometric process between substrate and enzyme since 1mol p-nitrophenol corresponded to 1 mole enzyme. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.26">The first stage of the reaction is the rapid acylation of some of the groups on chymotrypsin by PNPA releasing a stochiometric quantity of PNP-. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.26">The second slower step is the hydrolysis of the acylenzyme followed by the fast reacylation of the free enzyme by that of PNPA accounting for the slow zero-order reaction4. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.26">
<s n="s1.1;p7.26">The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate occurs at far greatly reduced rate than that of the p-nitrophenyl acetate and so the reaction can be followed by simple spectrophotometry rather than by special stop flow techniques. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.26">
<s n="s1.5;p8.26">The ability to measure protein concentration accurately is an essential technique in protein biochemistry including that of enzymology where it is important in determining the specific activity of an enzyme. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.26">Proteins are complex and variable in structure and because of this not one assay technique is capable of measuring the absolute protein concentration. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.26">Numerous assay methods have been developed, each of which measures a different aspect of the protein and often have different sensitivity ranges e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.26">Folin (Lowry) measures the reduction of the reagent by tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine and histidine residues sensitivity 5-100µg Biorad measures hydrophobic interactions between protein and reagent, sensitivity 20-100µg. </s>

<p n="p17.26">
<s n="s1.2;p17.26">The rate of reaction for the enzyme was measured by the change in absorption, the substrate was yellow and not very soluble due to its size (observed by the formation of a yellow fraction and a colourless one when Casein was added to the buffer). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.26">Once the reaction was stopped at the appropriate time interval, it was important to separate the substrate and its hydrolysed form (product) since both were yellow and so the undigested protein was allowed to precipitate out of solution and only digested protein was measured. </s>

<p n="p18.26">
<s n="s1.3;p18.26">The bell shaped pH profile of α-chymotrypsin for the hydrolysis of the neutral substrate suggests the presence of two ionising groups which play a key role in the catalytic reaction. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.26">The midpoint of the left of the pH profile shows that the rate of the catalytic reaction increases as the deprotonated form of an ionising group with an apparent pK of 5.5 is formed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.26">This pK can be associated with the imidazole group of histidine which would be unprotonated in the catalytically active form of the enzyme. </s>

<p n="p19.26">
<s n="s1.9;p19.26">The deprotonation of the imidazole group allows it to polarise the hydroxyl group of serine-195 which generates an alkoxide ion which is stronger nucleophile than that of a hydroxyl group. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p19.26">Therefore greater protonation of the imidaole group creates a stronger nucleophile which results in the greater probability of successful nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate hence increase in the rate of reaction. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p19.26">The midpoint of the right hand side of the pH profile indicates that the rate of reaction decreases as an amino acid with an apparent pK of 8.5 is deprotonated. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p19.26">Cysteine has a pK of 8.5 however the amino isoleucine would be charged at neutral condition therefore there must be another mechanism rather than deprotonation of Cysteine responsible for the decrease in the enzyme reaction rate. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p19.26">The mechanism is due to the removal of the positive charge (deprotonation) from the amino-terminal isoleucine resulting in the histidine-40 reforming a salt linkage with Asp-194 which obstructs the substrate binding site. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p19.26">Therefore the decrease of enzyme reaction rate is due to a decrease in affinity of substrate to the active site and not the decreased efficiency of the catalytic capabilities of the enzyme. </s>

<p n="p22.26">
<s n="s1.3;p22.26">α-Chymotrypsin catalysed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate occurs at a greater rate than that of p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate since the methyl groups on p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate result in steric hindrance of the molecule giving rise to a slower rate of hydrolysis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.26">Steric hindrance occurs in this case since methyl groups replace the hydrogen atoms in p-nitrophenyl acetate, the methyl group are much larger and therefore result in the greater overlapping of electron clouds resulting in a loss of energy and therefore reactivity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.26">Thus a greater amount of energy must be put into the formation of the acyl enzyme and its subsequent breakdown since there is a loss in the reactivity in the substrate i.e. methyl groups create a steric barrier which must be reached before the molecule will react. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p23.26">This was put down to accuracy of the assays i.e. pippeting errors; however it was felt that the nature of A, B and b could still be explained with confidence since the variation was not large enough to mask the true trends in the data. </s>

<s n="s2.13;p26.26">Biorad and Folin (Lowry) performed on the unknown concentration of α-chymotrypsin is large in both personal and class data: 45 and 38%. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p26.26">The difference between the protein estimations yielded by the different types of assays lies in the fact that they measure different attributes of a protein. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p26.26">Folin (Lowry) measures the reduction of the reagent by tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine and histidine residues sensitivity while Biorad measures the hydrophobic interactions between protein and reagent. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p26.26">The results demonstrate the importance of using the same assay method when comparisons of two samples of the same protein at unknown concentrations are compared with reference to their protein concentrations. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p26.26">The difference between the class data and experimental data is large for both assays (~55%). </s>
<s n="s7.13;p26.26">The class data set is larger than the experimental data therefore the values posses a greater degree of reliability. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p26.26">The experimental data is clearly an overestimate of the stock solution, the data for experimentally derived protein estimations for the different assays shows a low range (see appendix 1). </s>
<s n="s9.13;p26.26">Thus indicating that the error did not lie in the dilutions that occurred after the extraction of the appropriate volume of the 1/1000 diluted enzyme solution. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p26.26">The absorbance's for both assays were outside the standard curves therefore contained a concentration to great for the assays to measure accurately. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p26.26">The fact that the data for each assay contains a low range and the average of each type of assay is ~55% greater than that of the corresponding class data assay suggests that the dilution of 1/1000 of the stock solution is in error. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p26.26">Both assays used the same 1/1000 diluted stock solution which gives one a unifying cause of error for both types of assay. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p26.26">Thus the 1/1000 diluted stock solution was not diluted correctly; this is due to human error and poor pippeting technique. </s>
