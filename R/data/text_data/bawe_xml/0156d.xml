</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.8;p4.19">Thus in 'The History of Sexuality', Foucault attempts to disprove the thesis that Western society has seen a repression of sexuality since the 17th century and that sexuality has been unmentionable, something impossible to speak about. </s>

<quote lang="English">'<hi rend="italic">For he claims, it was precisely during the hypothesised major period of repression that there emerged 'a veritable explosion' of discourse about sexuality; in for example, medical, psychiatric and educational theories, and the practices that were both informed and presupposed by these discourses - the investigation and classification of deviant sexualities; the sexual diagnosis of mental and physical illnesses; the concern with childhood masturbation; and so on. Never, in effect, had there been so noisy a silence, so public a secret, as this 'repressed' sexuality</hi>.'(Keats, 1995: p. 29)</quote>

</p>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="italic">In The History of Sexuality, Foucault sets out to attack what, in a celebrated phase he calls 'the repressive hypothesis'. According to such a view, modern institutions compel us to pay a price - increasing repression - for the benefits they offer. Civilisation means discipline, and discipline in turn implies control of inner drives, control that to be effective has to be internal......'Sexuality' should not be understood only as a drive which social forces have to contain. Rather, it is 'an especially dense transfer point for relations of power', something which can be harnessed as a focus of social control through the very energy which, infused with power, it generates. Sex is not driven underground in modern civilisation. On the contrary, it comes to be continually discussed and investigated. It has become part of 'a great sermon', replacing the more ancient tradition of theological preaching. Statements about sexual repression and the sermon of transcendence mutually reinforce one another; the struggle for sexual liberation is part of the self-same apparatus of power that it denounces. Has any other social order, Foucault asks rhetorically, been so persistently and pervasively preoccupied with sex?</hi> (Giddens, 1992: p. 25) </quote>
<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.6;p9.19">The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are Foucault's main concern in his encounter with the repressive hypothesis. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.19">During this period, sexuality and power became intertwined in several distinct ways. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.19">Sexuality was developed as a secret, which then had to be endlessly tracked down as well as guarded against. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.19">Take the case of masturbation. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.19">Whole campaigns were mounted by doctors and educators to lay siege to this dangerous phenomenon and make clear its consequences. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.19">So much attention was given to it, however, that we may suspect that the objective was not its elimination; the point was to organise the individual's development, bodily and mentally. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.19">
<s n="s1.3;p10.19">With enlightenment, the view of sexuality as something sinful to be confessed mutated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.19">It was adapted to modern demands of rationality by turning itself into a science. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.19">Foucault makes a strong distinction between what we would still today call science and a prejudicial doctrine on human procreation. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English" rend="italic">"Comparing these discourses on human sexuality to those from the same epoch on animal and vegetal reproduction, the difference is surprising. Their weak tenability - I won't even say in scientificity, but in elementary logic, places them apart in the history of knowledge."</quote>
<p n="p11.19">
<s n="s1.2;p11.19">The doctrines on sexuality postulated several "unnatural" sexual behaviors. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.19">In the 16th century, the focus was on regulating the sexuality of the married couple, ignoring other forms of sexual relations, but now other groups were identified: the sexuality of children, criminals, mentally ill and gays. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English" rend="italic">"The perverse" became a group, instead of an attribute. Sexuality became seen as the core of some peoples' identity. Homosexual relations had been seen as a sin that could be committed from time to time, but now a group of "homosexuals" emerged. Foucault writes: "The sodomite was a recidivist, but the homosexual is now a species..... The homosexual of the 19th century became a person: a'past, a history and an adolescence, a personality, a life style; also a morphology, with an indiscreet anatomy and possibly a mystical physiology. Nothing of his full personality escapes his sexuality."</quote>
<p n="p12.19">
<s n="s1.2;p12.19">But homosexuality was not the only object of study for the medical "science". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.19">Foucault identifies four reoccurring themes: </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.19">
<s n="s1.2;p13.19">The body of women became sexualized because of its role as a child bearer. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.19">The concept "hysteria" was invented and seen as a result of sexual problem </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.19">
<s n="s1.2;p14.19">The pedagogization of the sexuality of children. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.19">Children should at all costs be protected from the dangers inherent in masturbation and other sexuality </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.19">
<s n="s1.2;p15.19">The socialization of reproduction. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.19">The importance of sexuality for reproduction is recognized and put into context in the study of population growth. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.19">
<s n="s1.1;p16.19">The sexuality of adults becomes an object of study and all forms of "perverse" aberrations are seen as dangers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.3;p17.19">Foucault emphasizes that the aim of these new moral codes was not to abolish all forms of sexuality, but instead to preserve health and procreation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.19">Many forms of sexuality were seen as harmful and they wanted to protect health and the purity of the race. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.19">A mixture of ideas on population growth, venereal diseases and heredity ("degeneration" was to be avoided) created the idea that many forms of sexual conduct where dangerous. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.2;p18.19">This view makes Foucault one of the first constructivists" in this area, claiming that sexuality and sexual conduct is not a natural category, having a foundation in reality. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.19">Instead it is a question of social constructions, categories only having an existence in a society, and that probably are not applicable to other societies than our own. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.1;p19.19">Looking at all the facts and arguments mentioned, I can thus have said to have looked at the Foucauldian ideas of sexuality in general and the sexual repression during the Victorian times in particular. </s>
