<s n="s1.8;p1.22">Today, some consider that 'there is no such thing as 'Greek religion''. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.22">In 'On making sense of Greek religion' John Gould disputes the notion that we can simply 'make sense' of the evidence left- 'data which we put together and call 'Greek religion': the best we can hope for will be no more than piecemeal explanations of a particular ritual or a particular myth' <ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.001"/> We have only a fragmented picture of ancient Greek religious practices from the evidence of art and descriptive texts. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.22">We have an even less precise idea of the reasoning behind Greek rituals- religious belief, as with other aspects of ancient cultures, leaves little physical evidence remaining. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.22">We do know that much of Greek religion was secretive and an enigma to the uninitiated even at the time, with widespread secret cults and 'mysteries'. </s>
<ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s5.8;p1.22">It is also difficult to come to conclusions on 'Greek religion', as the area we now call Greece wasn't a unified country until long after the 5th century BC, rather an area of land on which separate city states co-existed. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.22">Although it seems there were beliefs commonly held across Greece, we can't assume there was religious uniformity. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.22">To compound this, unlike religions more familiar to us, there was a lack of Greek scripture or an 'organised body' to dictate standard practice. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.22">Greek religion was 'an open, not a closed system'<ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.003"/>, with potential for individual interpretation. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p2.22">So it seems that the answer to the question 'Why did the Greeks perform sacrifice?' is unlikely to be simple. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.22">This essay will trace the emergence of Greek sacrifice from prehistoric times to the 5 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century BC. By examining and interpreting the evidence for sacrifice in ancient Greece, I hope to conjecture a few of the beliefs behind this ritual activity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.22">
<s n="s1.6;p3.22">The ideas behind sacrifice can be traced back to prehistoric Greece. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.22">By the Palaeolithic period, or even prior to it, mainland Greece was populated by nomads from central Asia, who lived in hunter gatherer societies.<ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.004"/> These Indo-Europeans brought religious ideas that would endure to the Classical period. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.22">Burket has put forth the idea that later ritual sacrifice was rooted in this early 'condition of man the hunter',<ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.005"/> when hunting and killing an animal was a spiritual, primal experience. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.22">It also seems that these nomads placed religious significance on the sky, the only constant aspect of their landscape. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.22">This seems a likely origin of the later belief that the gods dwelt high on Mount Olympus. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.22">Etymological links abound too; the word 'Zeus' has its roots in the Old Indic word 'devah', with the names of other Olympians such as Hera, Ares and Poseidon 'formed form Indo European roots'. <ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.8;p4.22">By the Neolithic period, the early Greeks began to form settled farming communities, again influenced by the East, where farming was first discovered. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.22">None of the domesticated animals and 'grains, barley and wheat' required for this development were native to Greece.<ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.007"/> Perhaps it was at this stage that Greece's preoccupation with nature and fertility, seen in its art and mythology, emerged. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.22">Now the Greeks could cultivate food and manipulate nature- yet the success of this was somewhat out of their control. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.22">A good harvest relied on favourable weather conditions, natural forces they didn't understand. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.22">When their farming efforts failed, they must have questioned the cause of their misfortunes, wondered what had such control over them. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p6.22">We must remember that in contrast to our modern view of deities as distant forces, to the Greeks, the gods had a direct influence over everyday life.<ref target="BAWE_6182e-ftnote.009"/> Right up to the Classical period they had potential for great good or harm, to raise pious, worthy mortals up as demi-gods themselves (e.g. </s>
