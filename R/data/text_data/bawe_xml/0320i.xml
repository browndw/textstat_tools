<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.19">
<s n="s1.13;p1.19">The focus of past research on delinquent behaviour has largely been based upon male offending patterns (Smart 1995:16, Petrie 1988:110, Gorman-Smith 2005:15). </s>
<s n="s2.13;p1.19">It can be argued that this research assumed that female offending was insignificant and therefore did not warrant separate investigation (Hudson 1990:116, Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004, 15/16, Kersten 1989:129, Cox 2003:9, Summer 1990:47, Oakley in Heidensohn 1989:85, Richie 2004:231). </s>
<s n="s3.13;p1.19">More recent debates around girl delinquency tend to focus on perceived increasing levels of girl crime (Taylor et at 1997:72, Cox 2003:3, Worrall and Hoy 2004:177, Lessen et al 2000:288) and/or the conflicting evidence regarding lower levels of crime versus boys (Muncie 1999 in Worrall and Hoy 2004:17). </s>
<s n="s4.13;p1.19">For example, The Home Office reports that in 2002 "four out of five crimes were committed by men and that male offenders outnumbered female offenders by more than four to one" (National Statistics Office website 2005 :1). </s>
<s n="s5.13;p1.19">Whilst self reporting studies show higher levels of youth crime overall, this could be explained by the fact that many crimes remain unreported and do not, therefore, appear in official statistics (Budd et all 2005:15, Lessen et al 2000:289). </s>
<s n="s6.13;p1.19">Furthermore, whilst these studies show that girls commit lower levels of crime, some studies suggest that girls do commit the same types of crime (Budd and Sharp 2005:2.). </s>
<s n="s7.13;p1.19">However, the category for running away from home, which is higher for girls than boys, (Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:30) is often excluded. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p1.19">Both types of study can provide statistical information or show pathways to crime, but fail to incorporate deeper considerations that would offer more understanding about girls' delinquent behaviour. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p1.19">Thorough investigations informing debates in this area need to include considerations such as the differences in types of crimes committed by girls compared to boys (if any), how gendered labelling affects delinquent accusations, as well as whether, or to what extent, differences in childhood social conditioning account for different patterns and types of crime committed by the two groups. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p1.19">Furthermore, how these labels might impact upon judgements in how delinquency is dealt with by the justice system. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p1.19">The labelling theory is one frequently used in the sociology of deviance (Jary and Jary 2000:328). </s>
<s n="s12.13;p1.19">It relates to the giving of labels to groups of individuals (Giddens 2001:292) and can be positive or negative, but is more frequently the latter. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p1.19">Who labels who is a contentious issue, as is the affects of labelling, particularly if they are negative, as they may be inaccurately applied. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.19">
<s n="s1.9;p2.19">The debates surrounding the topic of delinquency are complex and multi-faceted. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.19">Therefore, in this essay I will focus on three debates around delinquency among girls and investigate the considerations framing these. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.19">I will argue for the recognition of 'genuine' female behaviour - feminine behaviour that is not based on male ideals, that appreciates differences and supports equity between men and women (Hudson 1989:207, Smart 1995:48, Lees 1997:30). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.19">Until that time, girl delinquency will continue to be misinterpreted and dealt with inappropriately - thereby creating 'problems' for themselves, their parents and society as a whole (Walker 1972:287, Taylor et at 1997:72, Cox 2003:3, Worrall and Hoy 2004:177, Lessen et al 2000:288). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.19">The evidence to support this argument is split into three categories. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.19">Firstly, evidence suggests that different styles and attitudes of parenting will affect actual or perceived delinquency. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.19">Studies have shown that boys are allowed to be boys by having more freedom to live outside the home (Worrall and Hoy 2004:190), whilst girls must conform to models of femininity based on male ideals and remain in the domestic sphere (Hudson 1989:197). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.19">Secondly, different terms of reference are used to address delinquent acts committed by girls compared to that of boys. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.19">Any delinquent act </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.5;p3.19">committed by girls becomes 'embodied' - judgments focus on their sexuality rather than their behaviour - and therefore protection of the girl is the aim. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.19">In contrast, with boys, the protection of the public becomes the key issue (Scourfield 2003:158). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.19">Finally, I will argue that the justice system enforces double standards on girls, punishing them not only for their crime, but also for breaching perceived social morality rules (Campbell 1981 :4) or refusing to take on a subservient woman's role (Hudson 1989:206/7). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.19">For these reasons, arguably, girls may be treated more harshly than boys (Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:35). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.19">Of the three categories the latter should be the focus of change, as without policy and practice level strategies, any attempts to make changes at a parental or societal level will be thwarted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.6;p4.19">Despite the successes of the feminist movements and many international and European-level directives which aim to equalise women in society and the economy, major differences in the education and parenting of girls and boys still exist (Cox 2003:162). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.19">Traditional stereotypes emanating from the Poor Laws (Cox 2003:11) are embedded in today's society (Hudson 1989:199). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.19">For instance, girls are subjected to greater surveillance to minimise or reduce delinquent behaviour (Gorman Smith 2005:25), not only from parents and authorities (Cox 2003:11, Hudson 1990:117, McDonald in Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:128) but from Foucauldian-style self and peer surveillance (Lees 1997:5). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.19">This maintains girls in the home and the caring role (Heidensohn 96:33, Wilson 1965:224), whilst boys, for example will be allowed to go out with their friends, but girls outings will be restricted. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.19">The intention of many parents, and society, is that girls grow up, marry and continue in their subordinate role (Lees 1997:179, Kersten 1989:143). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.19">However despite these barriers, women may want to live on equal terms with men and experience the autonomous and assertive lives that men are argued to lead (Wilson 1965:224). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.19">
<s n="s1.7;p5.19">Today's attitudes about female delinquency are still influenced by past research (Campbell 1981:7/18, Smart 1995:26). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.19">Early research into female offending conducted by Lombrosso (1895) did little to support the idea of women as equals to men. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.19">Lombrosso (ibid) considered women to be at the mercy of their hormones which acted as a barometer to their sexual behaviour (Hudson 1989:204). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.19">Furthermore, he considered women suffered immature development and thus relegated them to an inferior level of beings (Campbell 1981:7/18, Smart 1995:26). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.19">Although some research painted female offenders in a more positive light, for instance Cowie (1968 in Smart 1995:23) considered women to naturally be law abiding, others believed women were more deceitful and manipulative (Pollack 1950 in Smart 1995:23). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.19">This research led to an increasing belief that women who committed crime suffered from mental or physical illness and historically the transformation of Holloway prison into a psychiatric hospital (Smart 1995:23) confirmed such a belief. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.19">However, in comparison with male offenders, women were not any 'sicker', but it could be argued that they simply did not fit into the typical male offending model and unfortunately these beliefs are still influential today. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.19">
<s n="s1.9;p6.19">More recent feminist research highlights male dominance over female behaviour. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.19">Be it that male behaviour is the norm and female behaviour considered 'abnormal' (Smart 1995:42/43, Walktake 2002:87) or females as psychologically inadequate (Hudson in Cain 1989:204). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.19">However, male generated ideals determine what is 'reasonable' behaviour for women and this is often related to their sexuality (Lees 1997:12/178) for example "...to appear sexually unknowing, to aspire to a relationship and let it 'happen', to trust to love and to make men happy" (Holland 1989:6 in Featherstone 2004:179). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.19">Connell (1987 in Waltake 2001:180) goes as far as to say that "the state arms men and disarms women". </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.19">Wilson (1965:224-6) explains how children are labelled as soon as they are born and this shapes their behaviour throughout their lives for example boys are expected to take the initiative, be strong and independent. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.19">He believes that although girls are born with equally aggressive tendencies as boys, they are expected to emulate their mother's passive behaviour. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.19">Furthermore, these types of gendered models are reinforced throughout the life course, for example through women's pages created in newspapers, assuming that women would not be interested in the bulk of the news (Wilson 1965:226). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.19">Girls will be subjected to a higher level of surveillance than boys throughout their childhood to 'protect' them from delinquency, and likelwise boys delinquent acts may be shrugged off as acceptable 'laddish' behaviour (Hudson 1990 in Gelshorpe and Morris :118). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.19">This difference in social attitudes is fundamental to a better understanding of the debates around girl delinquency. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.19">
<s n="s1.4;p7.19">Findings from recent research suggest greater control of girls to curb perceived increasing delinquency rates (Flood-Page et al 1998/99:58, Gorman Smith 2005:25, Wilkstrőm 2002:5). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.19">However, it is unclear how much of this research is based on the previously described male ideals. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.19">With tighter levels of parental control and other types of surveillance of girls during their childhood it could be argued that girls' activities are curtailed whilst boys are not and that male ideals dictate girl delinquency. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.19">However, the definition of delinquency and its application to girls and boys behavouir needs consideration, and to this I will now turn. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.19">
<s n="s1.12;p8.19">A vitally important difference when considering delinquent acts committed by girls or boys is that for girls' delinquency becomes embodied, for boys it does not (Smart 1995:48, Cox 2003:164). </s>
<s n="s2.12;p8.19">Such sexualising of female delinquency supports the idea that girls are in need of protection. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p8.19">This explains why girls are more likely to be elevated through the tariff system and arrive in court sooner and for less serious crimes than boys (Walklate 2001:7). </s>
<s n="s4.12;p8.19">Not only has it created a whole separate environment in which girls grow up, but subsequently informs how they will be treated, especially when they are accused of delinquent behaviour. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p8.19">Language can be used as a key "resource or constraint" to control women's behaviour (Lees 1997:2). </s>
<s n="s6.12;p8.19">It can keep them respectable, steer them towards marriage, perceived by some as the only respectable place to express their sexuality (Lees 1997:30) or shame them if they stray from the what is considered 'appropriate' feminine behaviour (Heidensohn 1996:41). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p8.19">When discussing language, it is interesting to note that certain words exist that only apply to females. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p8.19">For example there is no male alternative of the term of 'slag' (Lees 1997:32), which is used in a derogatory way to describe unattached women who have an active sex life (Lees 1997:23). </s>
<s n="s9.12;p8.19">Individuals to whom this label has been applied may simply chose not to be attached to or dominated by men. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p8.19">The nearest masculine equivalent, 'stud', is viewed as a compliment by males who are seen to be behaving in the same way (Lees 1997:32). </s>
<s n="s11.12;p8.19">Girls therefore "walk a tightrope" between being perceived as 'square or promiscuous' (Miller 2004:108) or 'drag and slag' (Lees 1993 in Worrall and Hoy 2004:189, Lees 1997:2). </s>
<s n="s12.12;p8.19">It is understandable why in order to avoid undesirable labelling girls conform and attach themselves to men (Lees 1997:23), thereby reinforcing socially embedded patriarchy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.7;p9.19">Looking at girl delinquency in more depth reveals that with the exception of theft (National Statistics Office 2005:2), there is a clear difference between the types of crime committed by girls and boys. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.19">Boys are more likely to engage in petty theft, vandalism, football hooliganism, mugging and riot behaviour (Muncie 1984:62) whilst for girls crimes are more likely to include running away from home, breaking curfew rules and unruly behaviour (Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:3), These are 'crimes' that could be described as challenging imposed surveillance rules. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.19">Girls are more likely to be offended against (National Statistics Office 2005:2) than offend (Petrie 88:90); 70% of victims of sexual abuse are female (Flowers 2001:45 in Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:25). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.19">Of the high number of girls who run away from home many of them are experiencing physical or sexual abuse at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them, many parents abusing their children have themselves been victims of abuse (Carlen 1988:153). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.19">Their departure from home is interpreted as delinquent behaviour, but interestingly the number of boys who run away from home is much lower (Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:30) and repeat offences may lead to parents declaring their girls 'uncontrollable' (Hudson 1989:198) with the result that many girls are transferred from the home to institutional care. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.19">Whilst this may remove them from the original threat, public institutions reinforce patriarchal disciplines and girls can become further trapped in the stereotypical female role (Kersten 1989:143). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.19">Although there is a general acknowledgement that youth delinquency is a passing temporary phase, it is disappointing that only detrimental options are available to 'protect' girls. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.19">
<s n="s1.5;p10.19">Evidence suggests that crimes committed by boys are of a more serious nature, yet it is clear that what is judged to be acceptable behaviour for boys is not necessarily the case for girls. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.19">As a result what is perceived to be delinquent behaviour will vary considerably between boys and girls. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.19">It will therefore be easier for girls to commit delinquent acts as girls cross the line of acceptable behaviour at an earlier point than boys. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.19">Debates that ignore this consideration fall short of understanding the complex factors that impact upon girl delinquency. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.19">Language and attitudes play a key role in determining how girl delinquency is defined and this is further emphasised when girls reach court. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.19">
<s n="s1.11;p11.19">Once in the justice system girls are subjected to the full force of male domination and stereotyping of their role (McDonald in Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:128/9). </s>
<s n="s2.11;p11.19">Some feminist researchers argue that many of society's rules are constructed and enforced by men wanting to retain power over women's behaviour (Campbell 1981:4, Cox 2003:10). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p11.19">When it comes to the justice system, women are therefore judged by men's ideas about how women <hi rend="italic">should</hi> behave (Campbell 1981:4, Cox 2003:5, Hudson 1990:117, Kersten in Cain 1989 :129). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p11.19">It is argued that the justice system is either gender biased (towards male) (Scourfield 2003:153) or genderless (female ignored) (Walkate 2001:180, Kersten 1989:129, Smart 1995:43). </s>
<s n="s5.11;p11.19">In addition, female representation in the justice and probation systems is extremely low (Hudson 1990:200). </s>
<s n="s6.11;p11.19">For example, there is only "one woman out of 12 judges in the House of Lords" (Dustin 2004:2) and higher management positions in social services are frequently held by men (Scourfield 2003:153), with only 18 women out of 42 Chief Officers of Probation (Dustin 2004:2). Hill (2004:2) reports that the government has agreed to changes that will alter the way judges are appointed, as well as the intended merger of prison and probation services into a single National Offender Management Service; with the intention to create more equity between men and women working in these areas. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p11.19">However, judicial changes are slow to happen. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p11.19">For example Lees (2000:4) reports little change in the way women are perceived in rape cases (as promiscuous) between studies conducted in 1993 and seven years later, despite beliefs of improvement and supposed changes in the way women were questioned or gave evidence <hi rend="sup">(1)</hi>. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p11.19">Arguably, because of this male predominance of policy and practice, models of delinquent behaviour are firmly based on male behaviour (Taylor et al 1997:15), which results in a lack of understanding of girls' behaviour when they enter the justice system. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p11.19">Even more detrimental, and the key obstacle facing women, is that the justice system upholds dealing with women based on their sexual behaviour; promoting the idea that female sexual expression is repressed and only allowed to meet her husband's needs (Lees 1997:30). </s>
<s n="s11.11;p11.19">When it comes to girls offending, their actions are not divorced from their sexual behaviour, as is the case for boys. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.19">
<s n="s1.14;p12.19">The application of male models of delinquent behaviour to females impacts upon their resultant treatment in several ways. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p12.19">Girls are therefore not only judged for their crime, but for their perceived deviance from moral behaviour (Campbell 1981 :4, Smart 1995:22, McDonald in Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:128) and may be treated more harshly as a result of this application of double standards (Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004 :62, Nacro 2001:1). </s>
<s n="s3.14;p12.19">Based on 'traditional' feminine ideals, courts prefer to judge girls on moral rather than delinquent terms thereby applying double standards to the detriment of girls. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p12.19">For example, it is acceptable for boys to experiment sexually, whereas legal action will be taken against girls for such behaviour (Campbell 1981:8). </s>
<s n="s5.14;p12.19">This fixation with female sexuality implies a judgement that young women who engage in sexual intercourse outside of marriage or steady relationship are considered immoral, therefore deviant, or at worst 'slags' (Lees 1997:2) and in need of correction (Chesney-Lind 2004 :60). </s>
<s n="s6.14;p12.19">It is believed that whilst "sex 'ruins' girls, it enhances boys" (Orenstein 1994:57 in Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:24). </s>
<s n="s7.14;p12.19">A girl's sexual behaviour will come under the spotlight - has she engaged in sex, at what age, with how many partners? </s>
<s n="s8.14;p12.19">Behaviour considered 'promiscuous' by the court will become the focus of the case, rather than the crime itself, even if that crime is as minor as running away from home/institutional care. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p12.19">Nor is there likely to be any investigation into the reasons why the girl ran away (Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:30). </s>
<s n="s10.14;p12.19">Research shows that girls are more likely to reach court for first offences or lesser crimes and thus be bewildered by the proceedings and fail to do themselves, or their case, justice (Heidensohn 1996:41, Hudson 1989:216, Walklate 2001:04). </s>
<s n="s11.14;p12.19">Passivity will also be expected as acceptable female behaviour (Heidensohn 1997:41), making it doubly difficult for girls to represent themselves effectively. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p12.19">Rewards for passive behaviour in courts may be met by more chivalrous behaviour on the part of the judges (Smart 1995:24); however this only reinforces patriarchy and female subservience. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p12.19">Additionally, girls are affected by shame more than boys and, especially considering that not only their crime but their character and sexual behaviour are under investigation, attending court may be an incredibly humiliating experience (Heidensohn 1986:41). </s>
<s n="s14.14;p12.19">Therefore, girls who resist the mantle of the 'traditional female role' undoubtedly find themselves in a very difficult situation should they appear in court (Walklate 2001:157). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.19">
<s n="s1.8;p13.19">Turning to the issue of sentencing, the difference between crimes committed by boys compared to girls is again extremely relevant. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p13.19">Judicial rules may apply to male behaviour, but not female. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p13.19">Criminal courts need to prove 'beyond reasonable doubt', but in non-criminal proceedings the aim is to demonstrate a 'balance of probabilities' (Campbell 1981:8, Hudson in Cain 1998:204). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p13.19">Therefore, the less serious 'delinquent' act, more likely to be committed by girls, eg running away from home, are considered differently (Hudson 1989:216, Wlaklate 2001:4). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p13.19">The court has to predict the future and judge whether there is a need for protection or action to prevent re-offending. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p13.19">On both counts it is likely that girls will be judged in need of protection and action and therefore treated more harshly (Heidensohn 1996:43/130, Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:24). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p13.19">Courts will use young women's sexuality "as a barometer for testing whether or not a particular young women will develop into a 'normal woman'" (Hudson 1989 in Hudson 1990:121) and therefore more likely to take action to ensure that she does or prevent that she doesn't. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p13.19">The application of double standards and the fixation with female sexuality is even more evident in violence and rape cases, where the whole situation can be turned on its head and the women blamed for male behaviour that has resulted in violent acts against herself (Lees 1997:5-15/30, Heindensohn 1996:33, Walklate 2001:155, Scourfield 2003:153). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.19">
<s n="s1.4;p14.19">As a result of these inequalities, the sentences handed out to boys and girls may vary. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.19">Boys who become disruptive are seen in need of punishment and will be sent to residential establishments at an early age, girls are more likely to be sent once they reach puberty, for protection (Petrie 1988) or correction. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.19">However, despite this appearance of more lenient treatment of girls (Worrall and Hoy 2004:191), the rules applied are likely to be harsher for girls than boys; with boys being allowed more time for physical activities and girls predominantly undertaking domestic chores (Kersten 1989 :131). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.19">This pattern can be explained by the less serious nature of crimes girls commit and that they are less likely to have previous convictions (Nacro 2001:3). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.19">
<s n="s1.4;p15.19">The application of double standards is more likely to be detrimental to the treatment of girl offenders (Campbell 1981). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.19">More recently, consideration of girls as a separate category within the justice system is even less likely. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.19">Moral panics about increasing female violence and changes in legislation (1998 Secure Training Act) are leading to a move away from measures to protect girls and towards assigning them to the same categories as violent men (Worrall and Hoy 2004 :190). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.19">So the impact of changing attitudes and legislation stand to disadvantage girl offenders to a greater extent than offending boys </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.19">
<s n="s1.14;p16.19">Recent controversial debates have highlighted the male dominance that exists within the justice system and it is therefore anticipated that consideration of these issues will be included in all debates about girl delinquency. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p16.19">Further, changes in the light of these findings will undoubtedly bring positive impact that encompasses delinquent female behaviour. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p16.19">In this essay I have argued that until there is recognition of 'genuine' female behaviour, girl delinquency will continue to be misinterpreted and dealt with inappropriately (Walker 1972:287, Taylor et at 1997:72, Cox 2003:3, Worrall and Hoy 2004:177, Lessen et al 2000:288). </s>
<s n="s4.14;p16.19">I have discussed how different rules apply to girls compared to boys that create different childhood environments. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p16.19">With girls being confined to the home by close surveillance (Hudson 1989:197), any desire to experience the public sphere, or remove themselves from oppressive or abusive situations, will be viewed as a delinquent act (Kersten 1989:143, Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:30, Hudson in Cain 1989:211). </s>
<s n="s6.14;p16.19">The case is not the same for boys, they are allowed freedom and minor delinquent acts will be considered part of developing into a man (Hudson 1990:118). </s>
<s n="s7.14;p16.19">Early male generated research still has its effects on today's attitudes to girls' delinquency in that delinquent girls may be considered to be either abnormal (Smart 1995:42/43, Walktake 2002:87) or 'sick' (as per Lombrosso in Hudson 1989:204), since their delinquency does not conform to male models. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p16.19">Secondly, language (Lees 1997:2) and labels applied to girls that embody girls' delinquent behaviour (Campbell 1981:4, Smart 1995:48, Cox 2003:164) reinforces their subservient role in society and promotes the idea of girls in need of protection . </s>
<s n="s9.14;p16.19">Whilst more recent feminist research challenges these theories, the reinforcement of everyday language upholds the view of women as either 'square or promiscuous' (Miller 2004:108) or 'drag or slag' (Lees 1993 in Worrall 2005:1890, Lees 1997:2) ensuring that women continue to 'walk the tightrope' between the two. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p16.19">In this way, girls' delinquent acts are interpreted differently to those committed by boys (National Statistics Office website 2005:1, Budd et all 2005:15), to the detriment of the girls who may cross the line of acceptable behaviour at an earlier stage. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p16.19">Finally, the application of double standards by the justice system punishes female offenders firstly for their breach from moral behaviour - based on male ideals - and secondly for their crime (Campbell 1981:4). </s>
<s n="s12.14;p16.19">This is not the case for boys who are tried for their crime alone. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p16.19">While this can sometimes be said to lead to more chivalrous responses on the part of judges wishing to protect young women, this is only as a reward for passive/conforming behaviour (Smart 1995:24) that further promotes patriarchy. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p16.19">Because of this fixation with female sexuality, women will be treated more harshly by the court (Heidensohn 1996:43/130, Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004:24/35), being seen as doubly deviant. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.2;p17.19">Until there are changes at the judicial level <hi rend="sup">(3)</hi> (Malleson in Hill 2004:2) to understand girl delinquency rather than forcing them into inappropriate and outdated models of behaviour, there will be little success at a parental or societal level to reduce perceived delinquency levels of girls. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.19">Debates that call for stronger control of girls need to be rigorously investigated, with considerable reference to diverse female perspectives that include voices both from the judiciary and 'delinquent' girls themselves. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.1;p18.19">Notes: </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.1;p19.19">
<hi rend="sup">(1)</hi> Investigation of this issue further is beyond the scope of this essay, but it provides substantial evidence of inequitable treatment of women who find themselves in the justice system, even for crimes committed against them. </s>
