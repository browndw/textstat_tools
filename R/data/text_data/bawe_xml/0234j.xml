<s n="s4.11;p3.13">Clearly there are examples such as emigration and immigration and adoption in which this claim is inapplicable, but these are deviations from what I take to be the standard case. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p3.13">It is clear that we do not choose our family or our state; rather we are born into it.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.005"/> Following from this, it seems fair to accept that we have obligations to certain other individuals, because we belong to these groups. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p3.13">We have obligations to the members of our families, and to the members of our political community. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p3.13">That we have the latter kind of obligation is something that this essay must take as a premise. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p3.13">If I did not assume there were such things as political obligations, neither considerations about the analogy of political communities with the family, nor anything else could tell us anything about them. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p3.13">This essay aims to establish that there is something to be learned about political obligation from this comparison, it is beyond the scope of this essay to also provide a justification for the (assumed) ontological status of political obligation itself. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p3.13">In the case of the assumption that we have obligations because we belong to a family it seems clear that we do at least think we have these obligations.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.006"/> Hardimon terms the belief that we have these obligations "one of the most salient moral beliefs we have".<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.007"/> I think it is a fair assumption to make that we do have these obligations, but as Simmons notes, possession of an obligation does not entail possession of a corresponding moral requirement.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.008"/> I shall deal with the issues Simmons raises in greater depth in the following section. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p3.13">At this point, I will simply posit that we do have obligations by virtue of belonging to families and states; whether or not these obligations are morally requisite I shall deal with later. </s>

<s n="s3.12;p4.13">It could be objected that the family, when young children are involved, does possess an analogous authority relation. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p4.13">However, I follow Horton in that I do not think that this family exhausts the range of families that can have the obligations I am concerned with.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.009"/> Our obligations to other members of our family are independent of the time when our family contained children. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p4.13">In fact, there seems to be a difference in the obligation that young children (may) have to obey their parents, and the obligation adult sons and daughters have to their parents. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p4.13">In the former case, obligation seems to stem from the authority of the parents, whereas in the latter case there is an absence of any authority relation, thus the obligation cannot stem from any such relation. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p4.13">As I said above, I am not concerned with the case of the family with young children, as this seems unnecessarily dissimilar to the case of the political community. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p4.13">The difference that I am concerned with is the lack of an authority relation in the case of the family, and the presence of an authority relation in the case of the state. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p4.13">It is important, though, to remember that this essay is not an attempt to explain all political obligations. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p4.13">The whole purpose of using the analogy of the family is to attempt to discover if there are any similar obligations in the realm of the political community. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p4.13">So, while it is true that there is a difference in authority relations in the two cases, it is false to claim that this causes the analogy to fail. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p4.13">This claim is false because the analogy (or at least my argument from it) is not concerned with providing justification for obligations that may arise from the fact that the state stands in authority over the individuals that comprise it; rather I am concerned with providing an explanation of the obligations (if any) that we possess because we are born in a certain political community, as we are born into a certain family.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s1.10;p5.13">A similar argument can be made for considerations of legitimacy. </s>

<s n="s4.10;p5.13">Of course, a father may not be an actual biological father, and so (arguably) may not be legitimate in this sense.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.012"/> A government however is legitimate or otherwise in a different sense. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.13">If all the relevant facts are known about a father it is a matter of scientific fact whether or not he is a legitimate father (as described above). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p5.13">In the case of a government, however, if all the relevant facts are known, there is still room for debate and disagreement over its legitimacy. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p5.13">There is only one condition for being a biological father, and everyone (to my knowledge) agrees what it is. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p5.13">The same cannot be said of political legitimacy. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.13">As with the previous consideration (of authority), however, it seems clear that this difference is not relevant to the argument I present. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.3;pn1.1">It could be argued that the appropriate claim for fatherly legitimacy would be one that referred to the role a father plays in his children's lives. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p6.13">

<p n="p7.13">
<s n="s1.13;p7.13">Simmons argues that what he calls "positional duties" are distinct from "the moral requirement to fulfil positional duties".<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.013"/> To provide an example, in the case of the family, simply belonging to a family does not entail that we have a moral requirement to care for our parents. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p7.13">Simmons accepts that we may well have an obligation to so care, but he denies that this obligation can ground a moral requirement to so care.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.014"/> In the case of the family, it may be something like deep care and love for each other that provide the moral grounds for the fulfilment of the obligations. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p7.13">It would be natural to think that this care and love was felt simply because of the relation we stand in to other family members. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p7.13">This is clearly false, however, as is immediately demonstrable by a counterexample. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p7.13">In the case of a child who is abused by their parents, the care and love that provided the moral grounds will not (in this case anyway) be felt. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p7.13">The position of the child to the parents is identical, they are still in the same family relations, but the feelings are not present. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p7.13">This supports Simmons' claim that there is a distinction between positional duties and the moral requirements to fulfil these duties. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p7.13">I accept this distinction. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p7.13">My argument can, however, take Simmons' objection and still be coherent. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p7.13">As I mentioned in the previous section, this essay is not concerned with all obligation. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p7.13">For this reason I would be justified in claiming that Simmons' objection is inconsequential, as he admits that there are the obligations I refer to, he just argues that these obligations are unmatched by a moral requirement. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p11.13">This is explainable, on Hardimon's account.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.025"/> If we consider the "abstract structure" of both family and political roles it is clear that the latter is more complex.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.026"/> It is also true that at the next stage of reflection, the "particular instantiation" of family or state, again, the latter seems more complex. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.13">This relative complexity would explain why we feel stronger bonds with our family than the state. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.13">The moral force would be fettered, because in the case of the state, it is much less clear that the abstract structure we accept is being instantiated as we would accept.<ref target="BAWE_0234j-ftnote.027"/> </s>
