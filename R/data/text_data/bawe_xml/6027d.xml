<p n="p1.9">
<s n="s1.5;p1.9">Manydown estate is situated to the north west of Basingstoke and takes up 5000 acres of land around the area. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.9">It has cattle, pigs, chickens, sheep and many different types of arable crops. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.9">Part of Manydown's mission statement is "to supply quality farm produce...care for our staff, our animals, the environment, soils and building...maintain a long term future..." </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.9">This really sums up the beliefs of Manydown and their ethos of the estate and farming in general. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.9">The farm has many different enterprises which all contribute towards profitability. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.9">
<s n="s1.7;p2.9">Manydown has a commercial beef herd and a herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cows. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.9">The commercial herd consists of 180 suckled cows, all homebred, but they are hoping to increase it to 220 cows. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.9">A "criss cross breeding programme based around the original Hereford Friesian cow and a Saler bull" has been operated for the last 10 years. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.9">Aberdeen Angus is seen as a 'quality beef' by the public and so Manydown started to produce it and now has a pedigree Aberdeen Angus herd. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.9">They received 17 cows in 2001 from Nightingale in Worcester. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.9">Manydown now have their first calves and stand in good stead for the future. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.9">The future is important at Manydown and they wish to continue breeding quality bulls and heifers in order to maintain supply for the breeding of the commercial herd. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.9">
<s n="s1.7;p3.9">There is a spring and an autumn herd: the spring herd calve in mid March and the autumn herd, in September. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.9">The autumn herd is then yarded through the winter and the spring herd is put outside to graze. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.9">However, it is extremely costly having the cows and calves inside, so financially grazing is the better option. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.9">By having the cows inside, they need to be protected against diseases and warble fly. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.9">When grazing, the grass needs to be a certain height in order for the cows to graze efficiently. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.9">The calves will find it difficult to consume grass so hard feed is essential when they are turned out. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.9">All cattle feed is produced at Manydown except cracker feed which is pellets of ryvita and is supplied by Countrywide. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.9">
<s n="s1.5;p4.9">The beef industry has increased recently and has a promising future ahead. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.9">People are starting to realise how beef is of good quality and can provide variable nutrition and high proportions of protein. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.9">Developments have been made in beef production systems so that the end result is an increase in liveweight gain. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.9">However, when a farmer chooses which system for production to use, many factors will determine his decision. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.9">These maybe financial resources like cash flow, physical resources like the area and quality of the grassland, the date of birth of calves: whether they are autumn or spring and finally the type of cattle: pure diary, dual purpose or beef, or crosses. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.9">
<s n="s1.1;p5.9">(Soffe, R.J.) </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.9">
<s n="s1.4;p6.9">The factors above will influence the type of production. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.9">At Manydown, the physical resources are whether to graze or house the herd, but financial restrictions will affect this. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.9">Growth is extremely important for the development of the cow and its liveweight will increase as growth does. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.9">The muscle, bone and fat will develop and the rate of growth can be controlled by the breed, the type of nourishment and the sex. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.9">
<s n="s1.11;p7.9">Above is a drawing of a cow and the parts of the body highlighted are those that need to be looked at in order to see what proportion is carcass fat. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.9">Too much fat has to be removed and takes time, so selecting the correct weight of the animal and the fat cover is vital. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.9">At Manydown, the Aberdeen Angus is killed at a weight between 620-630kg, which is a reasonably good size and provides a long loin which produces good quality cuts of meat. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.9">In the Manydown Farm Shop there is a wide range of meats, pies, bacon and sausages. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.9">It started in 1994 and now is very popular with the locals and surrounding areas. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.9">The Farm Shop has won many awards; the most recent was the Hampshire Meat Producer/Retailer of the Year in 2004. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.9">All the meat is slaughtered in an abattoir in Farnborough and then the carcasses go back to mature for 3 weeks at Manydown. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.9">They are hung for tenderness and this gives quality of the meat. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.9">Compared to supermarkets such as Tesco, where by the time the animal is killed, sent to an abattoir and put on the shelf it can be less than a week. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.9">That is why people are starting to prefer the freshness, the quality of meat and customer service at independent butchers or Farm shops. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.9">Customer relations are very important at Manydown because they want to provide a good service and show they care about their animals, the environment and the community. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.9">
<s n="s1.14;p8.9">Manydown also has 800 ewes which are a mixture of Dorset ewes and North Country Mules crossed with Hampshire rams. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p8.9">The ewes are grazed in parkland or permanent pasture. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p8.9">They lamb four times a year: Christmas, Late February, April and May. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p8.9">Nutrition comes from a winter forage of stubble turnips and concentrates and pellets are also used for lambs, which are then weaned at 4 months. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p8.9">Free range chickens are a recent occurrence and they are free to roam in an enclosed area (away from any danger.) </s>
<s n="s6.14;p8.9">They are fed GM free foods and are slaughtered at Manydown. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p8.9">Manydown has an old fashioned rare breed which is the large black pig. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p8.9">They are extremely easy to manage and produce good quality meat. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p8.9">Finally, Manydown grows oil seed rape, wheat, barley, beans, linseed, herbage seed, poppies and silage maize. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p8.9">Manydown has many conservation systems such as beetle banks and hedge trimming. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p8.9">There are many butterflies, rare plants and animals roaming these areas. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p8.9">The labour force is enthusiastic, skilled, loyal and motivated. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p8.9">There are 8 employees in total who work in all different areas of the farm. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p8.9">They are all very flexible and meetings are held to encourage teamwork and negotiate objectives. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.9">
<s n="s1.5;p9.9">In conclusion, Manydown has a lot to offer for the community, wildlife, its workforce and environment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.9">It takes into account many areas and issues that are seen to be very important today. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.9">The beef cattle is one of the main enterprises and from visiting the farm, one can really begin to understand how vital they are to the business. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.9">The Farm shop has flourished, the Aberdeen Angus is proving to be popular as ever and breeding is benefiting the estate too. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.9">Overall, Manydown has many different things to offer and for the future it looks to succeed and grow even more. </s>
