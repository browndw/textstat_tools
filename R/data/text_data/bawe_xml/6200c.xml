<p>The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC. Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s1.4;p115.120">It can be seen that when studying the graph of <formula notation="" id="BAWE_6200c-form.102"/> against ln(z), that all the points are linear, except the two middle values that lie slightly above the line of best fit. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p115.120">Therefore the measurements taken do fit the logarithmic wind profile law. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p115.120">It appears that the two middle values are inaccurate and the other values are more accurate. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p115.120">However, when all these values for each anemometer are compared with how often each anemometer stalled, it becomes clear that the middle values would be more accurate as these anemometers stalled less frequently, and that all the other points are in fact out of line with the middle two values as these points represent anemometers that stalled frequently during the IOP. This means that if the anemometers stalled less frequently, the line of best fit would be somewhat higher than it is on the graph. </s>
</p>
<p n="p116.120">
<s n="s1.1;p116.120">It appears that the scatter of measurements about the log-profile are not that significantly larger, except the middle two values, than what might be expected due to measurement error, especially considering that all of the anemometers stalled at least twice during the IOP. </s>
