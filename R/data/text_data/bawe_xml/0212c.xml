<s n="s1.13;p18.19">To most people their will is there own and the only person capable of changing it is themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p18.19">The key to being a successful manager, some might argue, is to change the will of the employee such that their key goal during working hours is to work as hard as possible. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p18.19">So far the paper has outlined why people work hard from the perspective of the employee, however, the person employing some of the techniques used is the manager. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p18.19">Any motivation techniques used by a manager is always orientated towards the employee. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p18.19">This includes the incentive of extra pay or additional skills. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p18.19">Following on from this there are explanations which can be attributed to both the employee and the manager. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p18.19">If employees become shareholders of the company they work for it is in their interest and the managers that they work hard. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p18.19">However, the majority of reasons why people work hard are down to the individual. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p18.19">Pride, morality and need to be creative cannot be instilled by the managers. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p18.19">A proverbial carrot can be dangled in front of each employee but the choice as to whether they want to work hard can only be made by the individual. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p18.19">It can be argued that by manipulating the workforce it is actually the managerial influence and not the individuals' personality that is the determining factor behind the will to work hard. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p18.19">This can be countered by the fact that if managers had no employees there would be no will to work hard on behalf of the employees. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p18.19">If the employees had no manager there could still be a will to work hard. </s>

<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.10;p19.19">During the paper I have outlined a multitude of reasons why a person will decide to work hard for themselves, their company or for the good of mankind. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p19.19">A key feature with all of the reasons is that they are all trying to explain the needs of a universal human being. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p19.19">Each explanation assumes that human nature can be calculated and defined to fit a non-existent perfect model. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p19.19">The needs of people will vary constantly and so there cannot be solely one reason for people to work hard. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p19.19">These issues were also addressed by Schein(1980) who first presented the idea of the "complex model" <ref target="BAWE_0212c-ftnote.022"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p19.19">In this model he indicates that he believes that the needs of people from day to day will be continually changing. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p19.19">One of the needs incorporated in his thinking is the will to work hard just like any other natural human feeling or emotion. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p19.19">Humans are not naturally rationally-economic. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p19.19">With Motorola, despite everyone being offered an equal incentive people reacted differently .Herein lays the answer. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p19.19">The greatest factor which influences ones willingness to work hard can be located at the root of all the reasons detailed throughout the paper: Human Nature </s>
