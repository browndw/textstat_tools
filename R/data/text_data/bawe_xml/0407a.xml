<s n="s1.3;p9.38">Hume's position on causation is the pivotal axis for his compatibilism, and the section on 'liberty and necessity' follows on from the section on 'the idea of a necessary connection'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.38">A necessary connection refers to a sort of force that drives one action to follow another; "matter, in all its operation, is actuated by a necessary force," (ยง8.64) Being an Empiricist, Hume believed that any knowledge not given in experience is unreliable and noted that causation cannot ever be experienced. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.38">We are confined to saying that we simply <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> an effect following on from a cause, but we cannot say that we have <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> of a causal relationship between two events. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.38">
<s n="s1.9;p10.38">Hume treats his examination of human nature in the same way as he treats natural events. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p10.38">Hume supposes that human nature fits in perfectly with a law-abiding and predictable world. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p10.38">We cannot assert that there is a necessary connection between motives and actions and other human related consequences, just as we cannot assert a necessary connection in the physical world, but <hi rend="italic">one must observe</hi> that there is a constant conjunction between 'causes' and 'effects' in human nature. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p10.38">If we could not observe a constant conjunction and if nothing were conjoined repeatedly to what went before then we would never have come up with the idea of a necessary connection. </s>

</note>
<p n="p11.38">
<s n="s1.5;p11.38">The uniformity present in nature provides us with an idea of necessity and causation, by way of an internal impression coming directly from repeated conjunctions of A and B, from which the idea of the necessary connection of A and B is derived. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.38">For Hume this distinction between impression and idea is important. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.38">Impressions are what we gain through perception and experience, they are lively and forceful, whereas ideas are what we have in thought and these are less lively and forceful. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.38">We have no impression of the necessary connection, only an idea, and this means we have no direct knowledge of it; "Our <hi rend="italic">idea</hi>, therefore, of necessity and causation arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature," (ยง8.64, <hi rend="italic">Enquiries,</hi> italics added) </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.38">Hume accuses the rationalist position of holding that 'if we can't know it, it is not the case', but Hume says there are mechanisms that force things to happen and we just cannot see behind the regularity to the inner workings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.38">
<s n="s1.3;p12.38">Hume begins his section <hi rend="italic">Of Liberty and Necessity</hi> with a close description of the way in which language and definitions pose an obstacle for the problem of free will; "the whole controversy has hitherto turned merely upon words." (ยง8.63, Enquiries) </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.38">Hume assures us that since everyone shares the same views on the doctrines of liberty and necessity, the entire issue relies ultimately upon an uncertain definition of the terms 'freedom' and 'necessity'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.38">At this point that Hume assures his readers that his argument will renew their interest in the subject. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.38">
<s n="s1.4;p13.38">Hume applies this theory of the natural world to human nature using the support of his studies in history. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.38">He suggests that in mankind we can observe a certain uniformity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.38">The same motives tend to produce the same actions, to the extent that we can largely predict people's behaviour and reactions; "there is a great uniformity among the actions of men," (ยง8.65) Hume is not suggesting that all men will react in the same way to the same situation, and our predictions are of course made more specific if we know the characteristics and tendencies of the particular person. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.38">The passions are the source of all actions, and he uses examples from the uniformity observed in the human nature of Greeks and Romans, French and English and so on (although this would be questioned by come contemporary historians). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.38">
<s n="s1.7;p14.38">Common intuition would suggest that men do act in less than uniform ways, and sometimes with irregularity, but Hume counters that the "human body is a mighty complicated machine" (ยง8.67, <hi rend="italic">Enquiries</hi>). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.38">The irregular events may just be a product of internal, unobservable operations and cannot be attributed to human spontaneity. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.38">Irregular resolutions of men may be due to chance, such as a good tempered man flying into a rage when he has a fever or is in great pain. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.38">This irregularity itself is a feature of nature. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.38">Hume uses the example of a peasant who cannot tell why a clock does no work other than stating it is broken, whereas an artist has an insight into the inner workings and can tell the specific cause of the problem, perhaps alluding to his own insight as a philosopher. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.38">The same conjunction can be observed between motive and action as between cause and effect, and Hume posits that this has been universally accepted. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.38">From this Hume reasons that we also observe the same conjunction and expect uniformity between men's characters and their conduct. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.38">
<s n="s1.4;p15.38">We can apply inference to our account of human necessity since we rely on inferences every day. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.38">Every action we perform is performed with reflection on the actions of others; "The mutual dependence of men is so great in all societies that scarce any human action is entirely complete in itself," (ยง8. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.38">69, <hi rend="italic">Enquiries</hi>) We expect that people will be consistent in their behaviour, according to their characters. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.38">There would be no history or politics or morality without inference. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.38">
<s n="s1.6;p16.38">Despite Hume's empirical evidence men insist that they observe a necessary connection in the outside world and it is because they do not feel this connection in their minds they assume that there is a difference between material causality and intelligent causality. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p16.38">But when men speak of liberty they cannot surely be suggesting that it has so little to do with motives and inclinations that we observe little conformity in human nature. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p16.38">We need to realise that necessity is present in every aspect of our behaviour, and we should begin by examining the unintelligible processes of the body rather than the 'soul' or the 'will'. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p16.38">The idea of necessity has always been accepted by philosophers and Hume presents us with a version of liberty that is compatible with necessity; "By liberty, then, we can only mean <hi rend="italic">a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will</hi>." (ยง8.73, <hi rend="italic">Enquiries</hi>). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.38">In fact freedom and determinism just do not clash whatsoever, and are in fact essential features of each other. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p16.38">The conflict is between freedom and constraint, not freedom and determinism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.38">
<s n="s1.7;p17.38">In his <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> Hume makes a distinction between two types of freedom; liberty of spontaneity and liberty of indifference. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.38">The liberty of spontaneity is freedom from external restraint. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.38">This type of freedom is compatible with natural causation <hi rend="italic">and</hi> allows us to act as we choose. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.38">The liberty of indifference is that we have the freedom to choose to act other than we do act (Quine calls this a 'sordid boon', a wasted effort<ref target="BAWE_0407a-ftnote.005"/>). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.38">Popular opinion holds that these powers of unexercised choice are real, and this is the real 'freedom of the will' that is widely held. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.38">Hume attacks the liberty of indifference in three ways: firstly by asserting universal causality, secondly from the pragmatic need to use inference to predict human behaviour and affairs in our day to day lives, and thirdly by refuting that we can introspect natural reality (thus refuting rationalism). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p17.38">The very idea of the liberty of indifference is inconsistent with a science of human nature and morality. </s>

<p n="p18.38">
<s n="s1.5;p18.38">Hume asserts that there is no way to step outside of the constant conjunction of cause and effect, and humans will always act as they are inclined to do. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.38">This includes a notion of determinism because we choose and act the way we do due to our character, passions and inclinations, the sum of which is due to previous experience or genetic dispositions. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.38">We do not spontaneously start new causal chains of events, but we are free because to be free means simply to act out <hi rend="italic">our</hi> inclinations, to do as we want to do. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.38">This is quite a specific view of freedom, a sort of negative freedom, since one is free unless one is perhaps physically restrained or compelled; "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains." (ยง8.73, <hi rend="italic">Enquiries</hi>) </s>
<s n="s5.5;p18.38">Hume therefore believes that his natural account of determinism does not preclude our freedom, however some may object to Hume here saying that this is not what we meant by freedom at all, we mean freedom of 'the will'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.38">
<s n="s1.6;p19.38">Those who adamantly cling to a more libertarian notion of freedom will no doubt be more appeased by Kant's account, however they might not be swayed by the measures Kant employs in order to preserve what Hume would call the 'liberty of indifference'. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.38">Kant intuitively holds an incompatibilist position; a strong belief in freedom and a strong belief in causality. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.38">Of course we would generally expect an incompatibilist to hold one or the other true, and deny the other. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.38">Kant feels he cannot surrender either and so he actually shares the same aims as the compatibilist. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p20.38">Transcendental freedom is more of a cosmological issue than a human issue, and is concerned with possibility rather than fact, and this is a stark contrast to Hume's natural, empirical account. </s>
