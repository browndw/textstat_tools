<s n="s3.5;p1.7">Should this effect the analysis of such sources, as it is a potential bias? </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.7">When looking at law opposed to 'entertainment', virginity has important connotations concerning marriagabilty, the reputation and retribution for the girl and consequences for the father who may have wanted to arrange a marriage to improve his connections (Sissa (b) 1990: 87-88). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.7">To discuss virginities importance in myth it will be necessary to investigate areas where virginity as a topic is underplayed or surpassed by another issue as well as why there is such a frequent occurrence of young virgins in mythology. </s>

<s n="s1.20;p2.7">Considering firstly, possible explanations for the extent of represented virginity in myth, one could be that the myths served to educate young people. </s>
<s n="s2.20;p2.7">What happens to girls who lose their virginity before marriage but also what happens if you reject marriage and therefore try to remain in the virginal state. </s>
<s n="s3.20;p2.7">An example of the latter is Hippolytus. </s>
<s n="s4.20;p2.7">He wishes to remain loyal to the goddess Artemis, therefore incurring the anger of Aphrodite. "... </s>

<s n="s6.20;p2.7">(Euripides, Hippolytus 6). </s>
<s n="s7.20;p2.7">Not only is he killed but also his step-mother commits suicide and his father is ruined. </s>
<s n="s8.20;p2.7">It is a strong image and it seems hard to believe this is what people actually thought could happen. </s>
<s n="s9.20;p2.7">The genre of theatre can not be accepted as universal truth, as plays have a purpose and that is to entertain. </s>
<s n="s10.20;p2.7">However it is known from medical sources that it was not only society that pushed for the convention of marriage. </s>
<s n="s11.20;p2.7">Marriage and therefore sex was suggested by doctors as a cure for some maladies at the time (Lefkowitz 1981: 13-15). </s>
<s n="s12.20;p2.7">Myths concerning girls who stray from what is expected of them, appear to preach that <hi rend="italic">parthenoi</hi> who move out of male control also place "...themselves beyond male protection..." </s>
<s n="s13.20;p2.7">(Deacy 1997: 44). </s>
<s n="s14.20;p2.7">Therefore they encourage pursuit from gods and the like. </s>
<s n="s15.20;p2.7">This reflects the view some people have about rape in society today; the person might have brought it on themselves somehow. </s>
<s n="s16.20;p2.7">This more subliminal message is much easier to believe that this is how the ancient Greeks could have thought, as from what we know of society, women were often kept indoors to avoid "seduction or rape" (Deacy 1997:49). </s>
<s n="s17.20;p2.7">Mythology of young women who have been led astray always end in misery for the girl involved (Sissa (b) 1990: 358); there is no happy ending for girls who do not follow convention. </s>
<s n="s18.20;p2.7">Overall the myths seem to promote 'normal' marriages as the best option for happiness and health. </s>
<s n="s19.20;p2.7">Therefore young girls especially, know from an early age that marriage is their target (Dowden 1989: 144). </s>
<s n="s20.20;p2.7">It is an essential part of their transition into womanhood. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.7">
<s n="s1.23;p3.7">Virginity also appears to have an important role in ritual and tradition. </s>
<s n="s2.23;p3.7">There were three virgin goddesses, therefore the likelihood of virgins playing a role in the religion at the time appears high. </s>
<s n="s3.23;p3.7">Athena, Hestia and Artemis are outlined in the Homeric Hymns, each hymn not failing to mention this unique characteristic. </s>
<s n="s4.23;p3.7">Apollo was also linked to virginity in a way, as his priestess at Delphi was a virgin. </s>
<s n="s5.23;p3.7">She was linked to the god like a husband, therefore as in the case before marriage she had to be a virgin and once united remain loyal in the union (Sissa (b) 1990: 345). </s>
<s n="s6.23;p3.7">Concerning human sacrifice in myth it is almost always a females (Doherty 2001: 79) such as Iphigenia or Polyxena. </s>
<s n="s7.23;p3.7">Euripides <hi rend="italic">Hecabe</hi> tells the story of what happens to the women of Troy's royal household. </s>
<s n="s8.23;p3.7">Polyxena is sentenced to be sacrificed, this will be discussed in more detail later on. </s>
<s n="s9.23;p3.7">A tradition for Athenian girls before marriage involved being part of a Bear ritual in Brauron (Dowden 1989: 21). </s>
<s n="s10.23;p3.7">Herodotus writes about another ritual involving maidens in Libya. </s>
<s n="s11.23;p3.7">In honour of Athena, girls were grouped and then fought each other. </s>
<s n="s12.23;p3.7">True virgins were easily picked out, as to bleed, or to die from bleeding is impossible for a virgin (Herodotus 4.180). </s>
<s n="s13.23;p3.7">Other tests to judge virginity have also been noted. </s>
<s n="s14.23;p3.7">One such example is that of trial by the Styx. </s>
<s n="s15.23;p3.7">The river would engulf the lie and the liar if they entered the water with a false testament around their neck (Sissa (a) 1990: 345). </s>
<s n="s16.23;p3.7">A further explanation of why virginity appears such an important theme is perhaps the Greeks found the virginal state intriguing? </s>
<s n="s17.23;p3.7">There seems to be been a fair amount written about virgin suicide, all later linked medically to the way the female anatomy works. </s>
<s n="s18.23;p3.7">Hanging is agreed upon as a 'suitable' death for a virgin (King 1993: 119). </s>
<s n="s19.23;p3.7">Those who did not bleed in life choose not to in death. </s>
<s n="s20.23;p3.7">Hanging therefore has several connotations and is used effectively by Phaedra in Euripides <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi> to falsely convict him of rape, as hanging is also an excepted response to "unwanted sex"<ref target="BAWE_6118e-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s21.23;p3.7">Medical practitioners of the time thought that the state that led to suicide, hysteria, was brought about by excess blood in the body but also by movement of the womb (King 1998: 47). </s>
<s n="s22.23;p3.7">The cure, as previously mentioned, practices a social response. </s>
<s n="s23.23;p3.7">The best way to get rid of the excess blood is to 'bleed', to bleed you need to have sex and to do that you should be married (Lefkowitz 1981: 13-15). </s>

<s n="s3.7;p4.7">Although 'acting the bear' at Brauron or Mounchia may not seem appropriate for women, let alone young girls, the process was to drive the madness and energy out before settling down (Dowden 1998: 102-103). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.7">Xenophon agreed girls needed to be tamed before becoming women (<hi rend="italic">Oeconomicus</hi>, 7.10). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.7">Virginity is itself a transitional stage but what proportion of mythology concerning virgins is about a change they go through rather than the importance of the purified state and the social stigma attached to early defloration? </s>

<s n="s3.7;p6.7">Perhaps virgins are so involved in myth because that was the only universal way of showing that the character was a young woman? </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.7">If for some particular reason a single female was needed to illustrate a part in drama for example, a virgin was used as "...spinsterhood....has no role in Greek mythology and ideals." </s>
