<head rend="underlined bold">Abstract</head>
<p>The velocity of longitudinal, shear, and surface, ultrasound waves in various solids was found to be in good agreement with the expected values and the governing theory. The attenuation of the ultrasound waves was more than expected. The angle at which a mode converted shear wave refracts was unexpected. Defects in an object were found and improved method suggested. The wavelength of a surface wave was unsuccessful.</p>

<s n="s2.3;p1.100">Ultrasound is used commercially as a method of non-destructive testing. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.100">It can be used to determine object thickness, detect cracks, and ascertain various properties of the materials being tested. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.100">
<s n="s1.1;p2.100">The range of uses for ultrasound makes ultrasonics an important area for research. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.100">
<s n="s1.1;p3.100">Ultrasound is used medically for such activities as prenatal scans and can measure blood flow using the Doppler shift of the ultrasound waves. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.100">
<s n="s1.1;p4.100">Today it is possible to place a component for testing in a tank of water (used as an ultrasonic couplant since air attenuates the signal greatly) and computer controlled robotic arms with transducers will scan the object, feeding the data into a computer for evaluation. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p5.100">They use laser ultrasound, plasma ultrasound, EMATs and piezoelectric transducers, which this report will focus on. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.100">
<s n="s1.2;p6.100">Since all material is comprised of atoms, and in a solid these atoms are held in equilibrium by internal electrostatic forces, it is possible to produce a mechanical wave in the object. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.100">The atoms will move together and if the material is not forced beyond its elastic limits then the atoms will return to their equilibrium position. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.100">
<s n="s1.2;p7.100">The inertia of the atoms and the electrostatic restoring force causes oscillatory motion to be established in the object. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.100">In solids, acoustic waves have three main methods of propagation; longitudinal, shear, and surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.100">
<s n="s1.2;p8.100">Longitudinal waves have oscillatory motion in the direction of propagation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.100">They consist of areas of higher density (compression) followed by lower density (rarefaction) and are sometimes called compressional waves. </s>

<head>
<hi rend="bold">Figure 1:</hi> A longitudinal wave propagating across the page. The thicker lines represent the areas of compression between atoms while the thinner lines are the areas of rarefaction caused by the wave. One wavelength is the distance between two lines of the same thickness.</head>

<p n="p9.100">
<s n="s1.3;p9.100">Shear waves have oscillatory motion perpendicular to the direction of propagation and are also called transverse waves. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.100">They require an acoustically solid material and consequently are greatly attenuated in liquids and gases. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.100">They are usually created from the energy of a longitudinal wave and so are comparatively weak. </s>

</figure>
<p n="p10.100">
<s n="s1.4;p10.100">Surface waves, or Rayleigh waves, propagate along surface of the object and the energy of the wave is exponentially diminished the further down into the material the wave gets. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.100">Most of the energy is contained within a layer with depth equal to the wavelength of the surface wave. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.100">The particle movement is elliptical in fashion. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.100">This type of wave follows the surface closely and so is useful for inspecting areas that other waves could not reach so easily. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p12.100">The wavelength of the ultrasound is critical for the detection of flaws in a material. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.100">The "sensitivity" of the apparatus is the capability to detect a small flaw whereas the "resolution" is the capability to discern flaws close together or near the surface of the object. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.100">Both increase when wavelength decreases. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.100">However, as wavelength decreases it becomes more liable to scatter and so the penetration of ultrasound into the object is reduced. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.100">Consequently it is hard to have an ultrasound beam that can resolve fine detail deep into an object. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.100">
<s n="s1.1;p13.100">Other variables that can affect flaw detection include the diameter of the transducer, the voltage given to the crystal, and the type of crystal used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.100">
<s n="s1.2;p14.100">Ideally the ultrasonic energy would only be reduced by the spreading of the sound wave but in real solids scattering and absorption also occurs. </s>

</p>
<p n="p24.100">
