<p n="p19.50">
<s n="s1.4;p19.50">Budgeting which is concerned with short term planning ensures that managers' attention and effort is concentrated on the significant deviations between the budgeted an actual results. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.50">Consequently, enable managers to identify inefficiencies and hence proper control. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.50">However, variance analysis is done over the basis of exception, that is, only figures that are in excess of the budgeted amounts are analysed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.50">This suggests the level of trust that upper management have on the plant managers and therefore, have a good effect on morale as plant managers do not have to explain everything they do but only where they go off base. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.50">
<s n="s1.5;p20.50">Nevertheless, figures that meets or not in excess of the budgeted amounts are not necessarily accurate information. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.50">For example, it is thought that there maybe some element of budgetary slack. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.50">It is contended that, managers missing the budget targets is faced with prospect of intervention by upper management, loss of organisational resources, loss of annual bonuses and ultimately, their job<ref target="BAWE_0253h-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.50">Therefore, plant managers, who are answerable for deviations in budget, might protect themselves from the downside risk of missing budget targets by negotiating highly achievable targets (i.e. slack creation). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p20.50">Justifiably, in Osni's study of budgetary slack (July 1973), he reported that 80 percent of the managers he interviewed admitted that they 'bargain for slack'. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p21.50">Pressures on management to perform in the present which affects their performance in the budgeting period, reduce the probability of initiating new programs, stifle creativity and undermine commitment to continuous improvement. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p22.50">For instance, plant managers have their manufacturing plans but sales group may insist that a production schedule be changed to meet customer's order as customer wants are primary. </s>
