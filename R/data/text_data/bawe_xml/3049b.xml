<hi rend="italic">Roadless Travels</hi> - A Company Profile</head>
<p n="p1.51">
<s n="s1.7;p1.51">"Making do with the natural environment" is the catch-phrase and inspiration of Roadless Travels (RT); a privately owned company keen on promoting responsible ecotourism in global areas, rich in biodiversity and natural landscapes. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.51">The name encapsulates the proverbial road less travelled with the idea of exploring areas difficult to reach by gas-powered vehicles. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.51">Founded in 1990 in Brecon, Wales, the company entered a mutual agreement with the Brecon Beacons National Park. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.51">The terms of this agreement: informally supporting the Park and simultaneously accommodating ecotourists (hikers and trekkers) and sustainable ecotourism through eco-lodges. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.51">The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) defines Ecotourism as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and sustains the well being of local people' (Wood, 2002, p. 9). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.51">Responsibility and sustainability thus form the company guiding principles, incorporated into the mission statement of the eco-lodges (consult Appendix 1: Mission Statement). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.51">Currently, the company operates six, less than 50 roomed, eco-lodges in six different countries, located in four different continents; each named in relation to its respective environment (consult Appendix 1 &amp; 2). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.51">
<s n="s1.7;p2.51">Roadless Travels has yet to penetrate the Asian continent and is therefore planning to apply TIES guidelines to introduce an eco-lodge to Southeast Asia, namely Pakistan (consult Appendix 2: TIES Guidelines). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.51">Years of political instability, poor infrastructure, environmental concerns, and recent natural disasters (October 2005 earthquake) have inhibited Pakistani tourism development (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.51">Pakistan's government is looking to set in motion the country's still developing tourism life cycle (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.51">Despite an impoverished populace, North-western territories such as <hi rend="italic">Chitral</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Naran</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gilgit</hi> are rich in topography and culture. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.51">Though challenging, responsible ecotourism could benefit these areas by sustaining tourism to the region, its environment, and Pakistan as a whole (Khan, 2005; Wood, 2002). </s>
</p>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">Evaluation of the Business Environment</head>
<p n="p3.51">
<s n="s1.2;p3.51">Penetrating potential markets requires an understanding of the business environment to determine the need to adapt to changing market conditions, and identify areas of sustainable competitive advantage (Gin, 2005; Lynch, 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.51">PESTE analyses examine previous events and experiences and 'can be used as a forecast of the future' to evaluate the overall attractiveness of the target country (Lynch, 2003, p.93). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.51">
<s n="s1.5;p4.51">Pakistan has lived under democratic and restrictive military governments since it separated from India in 1947; yet political tensions between the two nations continues to heighten political instability and perceived risk (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.51">The UK's political stability and low perceived risk implies almost non existent corruption levels, whereas Pakistan's current level of instability results in serious cases of organized crime (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.51">Under such conditions it would be advisable for multinational corporations to seek out Local Attorneys, providing useful insight on Pakistani local laws and business environments (Icon Group International Inc., 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.51">
<s n="s1.2;p5.51">The UK, one of Europe's leading businesses, contrasts with Pakistan which is considered a low-income nation which may discourage capital foreign investment; yet this may be solved though franchise or joint-venture agreements (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.51">, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.51">
<s n="s1.5;p6.51">Roughly 97% of Pakistan follows Islam and <hi rend="italic">collectivism</hi>, with strong family ties whereas the UK is <hi rend="italic">individualistic</hi>; thus there is need for a cross-cultural approach (Usunier <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.51">, 2005; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.51">Televised and printed media are common to both cultures, which could aid in crossing cultural barriers; however the internet would be problematic considering it is still developing in Pakistan (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.51">, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.51">
<s n="s1.4;p7.51">Land transport infrastructure similarities between the two nations is evident in the form of deterioration; with Pakistan witnessing a more alarming rate in need of massive investment, affecting both commercial and personal travel (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.51">Pakistani domestic telephone services are adequate for government and business use and Telecommunications have significantly progressed as new channels of communication, all of which is not new to the UK; nonetheless this could assist Pakistan in establishing stronger global communication and increase potential foreign mobile service investment (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.51">, 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.51">
<s n="s1.7;p8.51">Topographic differences between Pakistan and the UK are mainly arid deserts and mountainous regions; with the more temperate Pakistani areas similar to most of the UK landscape (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.51">Waste disposal and pollution are serious issues in Pakistan, especially in major cities; whereas the UK has kept environmental issues to a minimum, the most urgent being vehicle air pollution (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.51">In addition both nations leave room to improve energy and water consumption, with Pakistan's high usage due to inefficiencies in state-run power sector in generating and transmitting electricity across national grids (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.51">Nonetheless, eco-conscious consumers continue to enter the business environment and organizations need to consider the environmental issues when evaluating future target markets (Mintel, 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.51">
<s n="s1.6;p9.51">As indicated in the preceding paragraphs, the UK and Pakistan share similarities in terms of media usage, topography, in addition to some problematic issues. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.51">These are often obscured by their differences however, which include cultural, economical but primarily political instability and perceived risk; an area requiring serious thought in terms of market attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.51">The PESTE evaluation is not flawless however with possible biased information from Pakistani newspapers and websites. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.51">In addition, PESTE evaluations employ dated material that may skew findings and only provide a <hi rend="italic">prediction</hi> of an uncertain future (Lynch, 2003). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.51">Overall, it can be argued that tourism potential exists in Pakistan; although the country has yet to establish sustained internal order and durable external peace with its neighbours, there is no shortage of cultural attractions or scenic landscapes (Iqbal, 2005; Mir, 2004; Richter, 1999). </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Demand Factors in Pakistan</head>
<p n="p10.51">
<s n="s1.3;p10.51">Shifting demand inevitably affects business environments and organizations thus seek to understand, adapt to, and influence demand to capitalise on such changes (Munoz, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.51">As per Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.51">(2001), tourism relates to eight <hi rend="italic"> determinants</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.51">
<s n="s1.7;p11.51">Firstly, <hi rend="italic">economic factors</hi> and <hi rend="italic">comparative prices</hi> relate to tourism demand through disposable income and elasticity of demand (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.51">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.51">Pakistan steadily grows more elastic with added expenditure on leisure tourism, including domestic urban demand for summer mountain holidays (PKF, 2003; UN, 2004; WTO, 2003a). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.51">Many rural areas fall under the poverty line however, with income being spent on necessities rather than tourism (UN, 2004; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.,</hi> 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.51">Despite increasing oil prices, Pakistani prices remain economical with stable Rupee value compared to US dollar value (UN, 2004; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.,</hi> 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.51">Global tourism decline, due to security and geopolitical issues, has stabilized with tourism originating from Northern and Western Europe, South Asia itself, and the Americas (WTO, 2004a; WTO, 2004b; WTO, 2003a). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.51">Targeting global and domestic tourists via Ecotourism could add to sustainability thus rejuvenating local revenue and rural employment; moreover global ecotourists display a willingness-to-pay to support conservation and cultures (Diamantis, 1999; Mintel, 2003, Buckley, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.51">
<s n="s1.8;p12.51">
<hi rend="italic">Demographic</hi> traits such as age, education, family income and composition may influence tourism demand (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.51">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.51">Pakistani family composition however reduces "Visiting-Friends-Relatives" (VFR) travel given average households consist of six family members from various generations (UN, 2004; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.51">The average age of 20-30 marks a stage of independence and family support which lowers pursuit of higher education and tourism demand; the theory being higher education bears greater travel (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.51">, 2001; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.51">2005). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p12.51">Consequently targeting visitors keen on sustainable tourism, such as Northern Europeans and England, would be more profitable and better fit the ecotourist profile (Wood, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.51">
<s n="s1.4;p13.51">Such g <hi rend="italic">eographic factors</hi> as climate, scenery, and surrounding communities play vital roles as determinants; the theory being the more attractive the location to the target market, the greater the demand (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.51">2001). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.51">A diverse country in geographic terms, Pakistan has seen gradual domestic demand in more mountainous north-western regions (Javed, 2005; WTO, 2003a). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.51">Ecotourism in such rural areas could emphasize cultural heritage, Pakistan's scenic regions, and fulfil the 'need to enjoy nature' as a key determinant to ecotourist travel (Holden <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2002, p.439; Wood, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.51">
<s n="s1.12;p14.51">
<hi rend="italic">Socio-cultural</hi> attitudes relate to a population's views on how to achieve a desired quality of life and so fostering similar attitudes could effectively motivate tourism demand (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.12;p14.51">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.12;p14.51">Social approval may overrule individual judgement in Pakistan, with devotion to family reducing leisure activities (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.12;p14.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.12;p14.51">Islamic ideology is also deeply integrated into Pakistani life, from banking methods to religious holidays (Rosser <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.12;p14.51">, 1999; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.12;p14.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s8.12;p14.51">In such cases, the host country attitudes complicate social impacts of tourism and traversing such traditional barriers may require local support (Ryan, 2003). </s>
<s n="s9.12;p14.51">A niche market holding strong rural and cultural links, Ecotourism seeks to 'minimize impact on - and maximize respect for - host cultures' (Hertzer, 1965 cited in Holden <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s10.12;p14.51">, 2002; Wood, 2002). </s>
<s n="s11.12;p14.51">Social impact might be reduced by locals modelling suitable behaviour; creating a sense of pride, community ownership, and global awareness of traditional values and crafts (Black <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s12.12;p14.51">2001; Dimantis, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.51">
<s n="s1.7;p15.51">As per Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p15.51">(2001) cars offer greater <hi rend="italic">personal mobility</hi>, an important determinant of <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> tourism demand. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.51">Poor road conditions and past decisions have left Pakistan 'locked into suboptimal transport policies', reducing demand and ease of access to tourist sites (Imran <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.51">, 2005, p.506; Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.51">Sustainable builds and upgrades to motorways and city airports have enabled Pakistan to meet domestic, global, and expatriate arrivals (WTO, 2003a). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.51">Ecotourism would thus benefit from increased international ecotourist arrivals, domestic tourist accessibility, and modes of transport meeting ecotourism guidelines (Wood, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.51">
<s n="s1.6;p16.51">
<hi rend="italic">Government</hi> involvement may include transport policies, hospitality taxes, and environmental legislation; so the degree of intervention determines tourism demand (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.6;p16.51">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p16.51">Pakistan's government acts as a <hi rend="italic">facilitator</hi> seeking to enable an environment for privatized and public groups to reach full potentials; however this has implicated private destination marketing investments, and entry visas remain rigid (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.6;p16.51">, 2005; WTO, 2003a). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.51">As a result, Ecotourism demand is in the end influenced by the governmental zoning laws, waste treatment systems, and energy resources; much of which has been problematic in Pakistan but improving (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.6;p16.51">, 2005; Wood, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.51">
<s n="s1.6;p17.51">The final, more recent, determinants include <hi rend="italic">mass-media</hi> and <hi rend="italic">IT communications</hi>, including the Web; the theory being the higher their impact the higher tourism demand (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.51">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.51">Although basic, such factors impact domestic demand through media-induced tourism and communication coverage; yet attracting global tourism through far reaching media, namely the internet, is still developing and limited to select target groups (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.51">, 2005; WTO, 2003b). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.51">Ecotourism is equally affected by minimal Pakistani web-presence, leaving many global ecotourists oblivious to Pakistan's scenic potential; decreasing foreign demand and investment (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.51">, 2005; Wood, 2002). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.51">
<s n="s1.5;p18.51">Around the world this increasing awareness, and demand, for ecological and sustainable tourism to some degree is seen as the polarizing around the growing interest of a few global consumers (Middleton <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.51">, 2001) In other words ecotourism is in a sense converging towards broader, more macro, <hi rend="italic">behaviour</hi> (Levitt, 1983). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.51">Yet while this may hold true to certain areas of the world, Pakistan illustrates there is a lack of understanding and awareness of this niche market; thus, globalization is much less obvious when applied on a micro, more <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> level (Usunier <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.51">, 2005). </s>

<s n="s2.12;p20.51">As suggested, government policy in Pakistan creates high barriers of entry, reducing investment opportunities for new entrants. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p20.51">Even so economies of scale barriers are low due to an absence of major ecotourist firms or facilities in Pakistan, heightening switching costs for customers (WTO, 2003b). </s>
<s n="s4.12;p20.51">Porter (1980) implies entry involves major capital investment; yet economical prices in Pakistan create a high threat of new entrants (Lee <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.12;p20.51">, 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.12;p20.51">Strong branding, niche products, and expertise are exemplary differentiation barriers; which force entrants to spend more and reduces threat of entry (Lynch, 2003; Porter, 1980). </s>
<s n="s7.12;p20.51">Ecotourism, though vaguely defined, is quite differentiated; yet due to many unique ideas and tactics, it rarely performs the same way twice (Holden <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2002; Wood, 2002). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p39.51">Ultimately, authors agree it contradictory to strive to <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> include one or the other, and while some cases may gain through standardization, there will be cases where this will hurt the company; the message is <hi rend="italic">standardize</hi> as much as feasible and <hi rend="italic">customize</hi> as much as needed (Kotler, 1986; Sandoff, 2005; Usunier <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>

<p n="p40.51">
<s n="s1.6;p40.51">Selecting ecotourists as a target market would require RT to establish itself in a destination providing closeness to nature and local communities; with the aim of sustaining the environment and well being of local people (Wood, 2002). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p40.51">A venture into Pakistan would require a similar decision, and the lesser developed north-western provinces of the country, rich in topography and culture, would be an ideal location; namely the quaint town of <hi rend="italic">Giligit</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p40.51">The town's relatively small size would suggest a limited amount of commercialization and increased traditional culture; in addition its largely untouched natural beauty would provide the ideal starting point in exploring the northern regions (Khan, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p40.51">Despite its remoteness, flights to-and-from Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, could facilitate accessibility for desired global markets (consult Appendix 7). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p40.51">The venture however would take time. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p40.51">Given the lack of proper ecotourism facilities, as suggested in the analysis, RT would have to construct a new ecolodge in accordance with TIES specifications; suggestive of a <hi rend="italic">harder</hi> branding strategy. </s>

<p n="p41.51">
<s n="s1.2;p41.51">The company ecolodges use the <hi rend="italic">Brekken Moor Lodge</hi> as a template; entailing a <hi rend="italic">localised</hi> destination name and environment surroundings; in this case <hi rend="italic">Gilgit Grassland Lodge</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.51">Although the <hi rend="italic">core</hi> product of an ecotourism experience would be <hi rend="italic">standardised</hi>, the remaining physical and service attributes would be <hi rend="italic">adapted</hi> to best suit the overall Pakistani environment; modified to health and safety regulations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.51">
<s n="s1.3;p42.51">In accordance to the suggested minimized environmental impact, and primarily experiential nature of RT's venture, the lodge would consist of less than 50 rooms; in this case 30, double occupancy rooms. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.51">Though external design would mostly remain untouched, the lodge, as with each en-suite room, would be <hi rend="italic">ethnically</hi> decorated by solely Pakistani furniture and linen; with temperatures regulated by gas burners and solar powered ceiling-fans. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p42.51">A joint-venture would facilitate technological transfers with RT supplying telephones with built in modem connections and global operator services. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.51">
<s n="s1.4;p43.51">Three meals a day would be served to customers in the lodge's dining-hall, which would entail a local and traditional food buffet cooked by local chefs; ensuring necessary contact with Gilgit suppliers to determine available food inventories. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p43.51">Pre-arranged traditional music and dances would accompany the final evening meal, and provide a source of learning and entertainment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p43.51">The adjacent lounge would provide a communal venue for all travellers, domestic and global, creating the desired cultural interaction sought by ecotourists. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.51">Both these facilities, with respect to the Islamic ideologies, would not serve alcohol or pork. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.51">
<s n="s1.4;p44.51">In further support of communal sustainability, the lodge would only employ Pakistani nationals with major emphasis on Gilgit residents. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p44.51">Staff would be encouraged to use everyday phrases with guests, providing a cultural exchange through language. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p44.51">Hired local guides would lead trekking excursions, visits to local shops, and other <hi rend="italic">ecotourism</hi> activities; providing a wealth of knowledge on traditional values and neighbouring areas. </s>

<hi rend="underlined">Distribution</hi> :</head>
<p n="p45.51">
<s n="s1.2;p45.51">Although RT seeks to target a more global market, the limited number of rooms available could not sustain the considerable amount of bookings generated by a Central Reservation System (CRS) or Global Distribution System (GDS). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p45.51">Therefore, taking into account a niche market classification, RT would <hi rend="italic">adapt</hi> to <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> marketing through a lodge website and links through <hi rend="italic">specialized</hi> intermediaries, including the TIES and Pakistan Ecotourism Society (PES) websites. </s>

<p n="p46.51">
<s n="s1.4;p46.51">The <hi rend="italic">Gilgit Grassland Lodge</hi>, if built, would be the sole, legitimate provider of the ecotourism experience which could justify charging premium prices for a niche sector; yet as mentioned, Pakistan's high threat of substitutes and economic situation would require RT to use an <hi rend="italic">adaptive</hi> pricing strategy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p46.51">As illustrated in the Pricing Map the closest substitute would be <hi rend="italic">Serena Gilgit</hi> <hi rend="italic">Hotels</hi> in terms of eco-integrity and suitable location within Gilgit. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p46.51">The hotel itself is a four-star, one rating above the ecolodge, and thus can permit itself to also charge premium prices; the biggest difference being the lack of a <hi rend="italic">pure</hi> ecotourism concept. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p46.51">Even so this situation would require the lodge to charge a lower rate in comparison in order to further entice new ecotourists, unfamiliar with the RT brand; in addition the lodge could thus draw in ecotourists already using the greenwashed substitute (Consult appendix 6: Positioning Map with comparative prices). </s>

<s n="s1.6;p47.51">Entering Pakistan through a joint venture could benefit RT by way of local expertise in accessing local distribution channels and marketing tools. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p47.51">However, culture can influence the development of suitable marketing communications; the theory being when 'home and host cultures are different, <hi rend="italic">localized</hi> advertisements are more favourably viewed' (Pae <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2002, p. 186) To this extent brand familiarity would have to be <hi rend="italic">adapted</hi> to local values through <hi rend="italic">Transformational advertising</hi>; whereby RT adopts a <hi rend="italic">implicit</hi> method of communicating brand image, supportive of Pakistani ideology. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p47.51">Thus RT would seek to <hi rend="italic">standardize</hi> universal support for ecotourism while <hi rend="italic">adapting</hi> to a more transformational, namely Pakistani, message. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p47.51">Consequently this could create traditional awareness in desired global markets, while increasing local favouritism. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p47.51">As mentioned the lodge website would provide a practical marketing tool with great global reach, and could ultimately provide a <hi rend="italic">brand library</hi> through links to other RT ecolodges around the world; all with their own <hi rend="italic">adaptive</hi> advertising methods. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p47.51">Global and local televised and printed adverts would be kept to a minimum, and targeted to specific ecotourist intermediaries to limit mass advertising; the reason being this could easily reach a large numbers of mass-tourists and negatively impact the ecotourism in Gilgit. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p49.51">
<s n="s1.6;p49.51">As demonstrated throughout this marketing research study, by way of the various topics discussed, the potential for ecotourism in Pakistan is indeed a feasible concept; albeit a challenging one. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p49.51">As suggested, if Roadless Travels decide to enter the country through a joint venture, this would not only promote the ecotourism concept as a whole, it would provide the nation with a sustainable development through foreign investment. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p49.51">Despite this positive outlook, it would be advisable for the firm to postpone on future market entry into Pakistan owing to a currently turbulent environment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p49.51">Recent natural disasters such as the earthquake of October 8 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 2005 have worsened infrastructure, telecommunications, agricultural lands and industrial estates (Khan, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p49.51">Moreover, the nation's geo-political and economical situations further increase this turbulence; some examples include the continued war on terrorism, Islamic extremism, and poverty (Ellis, 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p49.51">To summarize, the relatively low levels of <hi rend="italic">changeability</hi> and <hi rend="italic">predictability</hi> underline the nation as, at this time, highly turbulent (Lynch, 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.51">
<s n="s1.4;p50.51">Implications exist in the report itself. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p50.51">Statistic information for ecotourism and Pakistan may be dated owing to the annual time frame required to gather such data; thus 2005 figures may be posted in the early months of the following year. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p50.51">Various sources, such as newspapers, were also used in the PESTE analysis which may present a certain level of bias; thus skewing the overall findings. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p50.51">A level of justifiable subjectivity was necessary in evaluating the market attractiveness, supply factors, and positioning map; nevertheless, this subjectivity may again skew overall findings. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.51">
<s n="s1.3;p51.51">In spite of the study's hypothetical nature; though currently damaged and in need of aide, Pakistan presents potential for ecotourism. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p51.51">However, important investment will be required in infrastructure to achieve high levels of economic growth and sustainability. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p51.51">It would thus be advisable to reapply this research after a 5 - 10 year time period, and revaluate the future potential for this niche market in this emerging destination. </s>
