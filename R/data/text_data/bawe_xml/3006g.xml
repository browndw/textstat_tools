<s n="s1.6;p3.16">In order to determine whether writers during this period "lost in faith" in narrative, it is important to understand the levels operating within this framework. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.16">A number of literary theorists have referred to "narrative" as "a particular form of representation implementing signs"; it is, furthermore, "necessarily bound up with sequence, space and time".<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.002"/> Narrative is essentially the mode of sequencing and selecting a set of events determined by the overall "plot". </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.16">The modern period saw a disruption in narrative continuity; a distinct move away from realist linear narratives. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.16">Paul Cobley asserts that "narrative has the potential to be thoroughly captivating"<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.003"/>, but, as suggested by Peter Brooks, narrative must entail a number of delays or <hi rend="italic">detours</hi>. </s>

<s n="s6.6;p3.16">Both <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> give evidence of such narrative <hi rend="italic">detours</hi>, which function to give the texts layers of meaning and embrace the ""thickness" of [modern] experience". <ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.005"/> </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.16">Virginia Woolf regarded narrative structures, particularly the meta-narrative of history, to be gendered as specifically "masculine", and sought to feminise the novel. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.16">Hence, it is possible to argue that <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> is in fact an "anti-narrative"; a series of <hi rend="italic">detours</hi> tenuously linked together by a fine thread. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.16">It is clear that the text pulls strongly against the formal linear, forward drive of conventional narrative structures. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.16">However, this is not to say that Woolf "lost faith" in narrative, rather that she wanted to change it. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.16">Unlike Conrad's novel, which is essentially driven forward by Marlow's journey, the journeys in <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> seem to occur outside the text; it could be argued that other than the characters' journeys through the streets of London, the only journeys move backwards through memory. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.16">Woolf largely marginalises exterior events, using them mainly as mere triggers to direct characters in and out of interior monologues. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.16">However, if the key term in defining narrative is that it is the "mode of sequencing and selecting a set of events", <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi>, it might be argued does have a narrative structure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.7;p5.16">Throughout the novel Woolf employs various techniques of focalisation, whereby the novel moves between several key characters, or focalisers, whose inner thoughts and emotions are conveyed through the third person, but in the absence of an authoritative narrating voice. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.16">This method is often referred to as "Free Indirect Discourse", or "Narrated Interior Monologue". </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.16">Through this technique the city of London becomes part of the consciousnesses of the people who inhabit it. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.16">It is thus possible to argue that Woolf has not "lost faith in narrative", but has manipulated the elements of narrative space and sequence in order to present her readers with a multi-dimensional and deeply psychological perspective of the modern world. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.16">Of course, the novel is not entirely built upon this technique. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.16">Woolf presents us with various levels of representation which guide us into the consciousnesses of the characters, using both direct, and indirect, speech and thought. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.16">Although there is no authoritative narrating voice, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a narrator who subtly guides the reader through the text. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.9;p6.16">It is possible to apply Walter Benjamin's term "<hi rend="italic">Flaneurs</hi>" or "idle stroller" to the individual characters used within Woolf's focalising process, what she called her "tunnelling technique". </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.16">There appear to be three key "<hi rend="italic">flaneurs</hi>": Clarissa Dalloway, Septimus Warren Smith and Peter Walsh. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.16">Each of these characters serves to parallel and contrast each other creating a highly complex narrative structure. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.16">David Bradshaw considers that, "Even by Woolf's extraordinary standards, <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> is a deeply organized novel." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s5.9;p6.16">This "tunnelling technique" is evident throughout the novel, whereby an external image will bring return the reader from behind the eyes of one character to a more narrative position and perhaps connect them to a different focaliser. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.16">It is such techniques which give the text a sense of structure and a feeling of moving forward. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.16">Woolf's novel is a poetic narrative, whereby the diachronic structures of conventional narrative are broken by the application of synchronic, poetic features. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.16">This is particularly evident in Septimus's own narrative which is fractured by his own diachronic historical narrative as a soldier, and his synchronic desire to be a poet. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.16">Such conflicts throughout the text create a dramatically disintegrated continuum which sets Woolf's work apart from more traditional, "masculine" forms of narrative. </s>

<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.9;p7.16">In <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> there is also little evidence to support the view that writers of the modern period "lost faith in narrative". </s>
<s n="s2.9;p7.16">Indeed Conrad's narrative is far from being simple, but again it is possible to argue that Conrad has utilised elements of narrative in order to create a "short but rich narrative"<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p7.16">Conrad's narrative is problematic partly due to the ambiguity of whose story is being told. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p7.16">Much of the text is spoken by the second narrator, Marlow, who is in turn introduced by a first narrator who remains nameless. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p7.16">It is often questioned whether it is Kurtz's story, as narrated by Marlow, or Marlow's own story, or even the story of the first narrator as he listens to Marlow's tale. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p7.16">However, this is not to say that Conrad has "lost faith in narrative", but that, like Woolf, he experiments with the voices present within the novel as a whole. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p7.16">In his essay, "Discourse in the Novel", Mikhail Bakhtin suggests that the novel can be defined as "a diversity of social speech types, sometimes even diversity of languages and a diversity of individual voices, artistically organised." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s8.9;p7.16">Bakhtin considered novels to be "heteroglossic"; that is compiled of a number of different voices. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p7.16">It could be argued that Conrad uses the voices of the two narrators to shape his narrative which is dually concerned with the levels of morality and dynamics of imperialism in the modern period, and an exploration into the "fragmentation of the self".<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.009"/> </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s3.11;p8.16">In both <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> there are two levels of time. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.16">In Woolf's novel structural time is indicated throughout the novel by the chimes of Big Ben: "There! </s>

<s n="s9.11;p8.16">This duality of time can also be understood as the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> time of the novel, set in the space of one day - a hot Wednesday in June 1923- and the time outside the novel recorded in the memories of the characters. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p8.16">Ricoeur shares Brook's view of the importance of the "end point of the narrative"; that "the understanding of successive actions, thoughts and feelings in a narrative is dictated by anticipation of the conclusion".<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.012"/> In Woolf's novel, the anticipated "end point" is ultimately Clarissa's party for which she spends the large majority of the narrative preparing. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s5.7;p9.16">This second level of time is further complicated by the nature of Marlow's narrative in which he moves backwards and forwards; it is held together largely by the two divisions between chapters which mark the three stages of his journey and meeting with Kurtz, giving the narrative a more linear drive forwards. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p13.16">The final part of the statement points to the construction of "complex characters". </s>
<s n="s2.9;p13.16">In her essay, "Mr. Bennett and Mrs Brown" (1924), Virginia Woolf refers to Mr Arnold Bennett's view that "The foundation of good fiction is character-creating and nothing else [...] If the characters are real the novel will have a chance; if they are not, oblivion will be its portion".<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.022"/> However, Woolf's essay is in fact a critique of Mr. Bennett's own methods of "character-creating" which focused largely on exterior description. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p13.16">In her essay "Modern Fiction" (1919), she argues that "an ordinary mind on an ordinary day [...] receives a myriad impression [...]. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p13.16">Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end." </s>
<s n="s5.9;p13.16">This also provides an argument to support the deliberate restraint to adhere to a linear drive within the narrative. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p13.16">Later she purports the way in which she, herself, would construct her characters in <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi>: "Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall." </s>

<s n="s8.9;p13.16">In both <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> this is evident in the creation of "complex characters". </s>

<s n="s1.13;p14.16">In <hi rend="italic">Heart of</hi> Darkness Kurtz, Marlow and his predecessor, Fresleven are the only named characters; every other character is called after their function which might suggest that "they are types rather than strongly individualised figures" emphasising "the symbolic meaning of Marlow's tale." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.025"/>
<s n="s2.13;p14.16">Marlow is clearly the most "complex" character in Conrad's novel, although this is not because of an internal sense of "self", but rather he is complex as a construct. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p14.16">Immediately involved in the text, his own personal reactions to his experiences on his journey to, and in, Africa are "a major aspect of his narrative".<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.026"/> It has been much debated as to how close Marlow, his experiences and views are to those of Conrad himself. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p14.16">Some have read Marlow as Conrad's alter ego, although it might be more accurate to understand Marlow as being a complex intermediary between author and text who "subtly directs the reader's response to his tale." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.027"/>
<s n="s5.13;p14.16">It is possible to suggest that Marlow is evidence of Conrad creating characters that resemble human beings; the character contradicts himself a number of times throughout the novel. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p14.16">The most obvious example of such contradictions is how he exclaims: "I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie" yet first lies to the brickmaker, becoming "in an instant [...] a pretence,"<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.028"/> and more significantly, he lies at the end to Kurtz's Intended when he "laid the ghost of his [Kurtz] gifts at last with a lie"<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.029"/>. </s>

<s n="s9.13;p14.16">However, as a construct he remains an important character in demonstrating the "the perversion of idealism that inevitably follows the obstinate and uncontrolled wish to achieve one's end." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.030"/>
<s n="s10.13;p14.16">Marlow functions as a commentator of Kurtz's demise attributing the "transformation from virtue to vice" to the fact that Kurtz's lacks "restraint". </s>
<s n="s11.13;p14.16">Kurtz essentially internalises his "savage" surroundings, exposing his heroic reputation as a lie as the "wilderness seemed to draw him to a pitiless breast" like a dependent baby. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> is ultimately a journey into the self, where by the "heart of darkness" is symbolic of both the unconscious and the Congo. </s>

<s n="s3.13;p15.16">It might be argued that to some extent these characters are defined by the streets they walk; Clarissa walks in the fashionable shopping centre of Bond Street and is indeed herself a fashionable accessory to social and political power, represented by her husband; Peter journeys through areas of London which are all central and symbolic of imperial power, for example Victoria Street and Trafalgar Square. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p15.16">What is perhaps more interesting when observing Woolf's character constructions, are the parallels that occur between Clarissa and Septimus. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p15.16">Bradshaw suggests that these unfolding links are one of the novel's most "designed aspects" which give the narrative its "deeply organized"<ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.031"/> structure. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p15.16">One of the dominant threads within the novel is the conflict that these characters share between themselves and the world outside them. </s>

<s n="s9.13;p15.16">Similarly, Septimus battles with his public role as a heroic war veteran and his private desire to be a student of literature and a poet. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p15.16">Septimus's consciousness is further complicated by the shellshock, or hysteria from which he suffers, a condition supposed to occur only in women. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p15.16">The minds of these characters seem to be "disordered in a similar manner", both of them probing the surface of the external world to find a means of resolving their personal conflicts; for Septimus this is found in death. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p15.16">The fascinating construction of the consciousnesses of these characters gives rise to a vast number of questions about their identities, sexuality, and personal conflicts. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p15.16">Furthermore, it essentially foregrounds the "psychological lesions and social schisms of London" as well as giving "an almost equally strong emphasis on the underlying communality of the city, the latent 'universal love' (pp.57, 125) which Septimus apprehends and in which Woolf passionately believed." <ref target="BAWE_3006g-ftnote.033"/> </s>
