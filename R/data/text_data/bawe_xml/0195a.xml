<s n="s6.12;p1.14">Globalisation may be just a buzzword used by the powerful states to hide selfish interests. </s>

<s n="s8.12;p1.14">Whose morality are we to promote globally? </s>
<s n="s9.12;p1.14">Moreover, the cosmopolitan democracy advocated by authors like Held may seem wishful thinking since there is no global 'demos'. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p1.14">First the essay will make a description of the main cosmopolitan ideas and of globalisation's transformative power. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p1.14">The paper will argue that the ethical dilemmas inherent in moral universalism (advocated by cosmopolitanism) are difficult to overcome. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p1.14">The essay will conclude that cosmopolitanism seems to have developed the institutional dimension (cosmopolitan democracy's features) but has neglected its ethical dimension. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p2.14">Is there a genuine necessity to rethink the concepts of political community and democracy? </s>

<s n="s3.10;p2.14">The first section of the essay will look at the main cosmopolitan ideas and the context in which scholars speak of their revival. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.14">The second part will argue that the transformative capacity of globalisation assumed by cosmopolitans, and taken as the impetus for political change, is not universally accepted as such. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.14">Realists or leftists would reject globalisation and highlight that the great powers still dictate while international relations continue to be a struggle for power. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.14">In the third section, the essay will point out to the dilemmas inherent in moral universalism advocated in cosmopolitan thought. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.14">Whose morality are we to promote globally? </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.14">In line with the Ancient Socratic debate with the sophists, a realist would argue that might makes right.<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.001"/> In a world of moral pluralism how is cosmopolitanism going to promote universalism? </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.14">As Gray mentions there may be the case that "No single way of life exhausts the possibilities of human flourishing".<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.002"/> Finally, the paper will question the feasibility of the cosmopolitan democracy project on the basis of the lack of a global 'demos'. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p3.14">What is cosmopolitanism? </s>
<s n="s2.10;p3.14">Briefly, cosmopolitanism is a normative liberal theory<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.003"/> advocating universal freedom and equality. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.14">Irrespective of culture, nation or citizenship, people all over the world should enjoy the same opportunities to basic rights as well as have the same duties to humanity simply because there is a universal human essence and certain universal truths. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p3.14">Any rational person under a 'veil of ignorance' would agree that life, freedom, security or the pursuit of happiness, are human universal goods that must be protected and promoted.<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.004"/> Cosmopolitanism as an appeal to humanity can be traced back to Stoicism and the Enlightenment's ideas of philosophers like Rousseau and Kant. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p3.14">For instance, Kant has pointed out to humanity's inclination towards constant moral improvement (perceived, as the disinterested sympathy of the beholders to the French Revolution, which gave birth to a feeling of solidarity).<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.005"/> Kant also considered that the spread of commerce and republicanism would eventually foster cosmopolitan feelings and the laws of nations would be extended to include transnational rights of individuals on the basis of universal human freedom. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p3.14">Nowadays, scholars believe that we witness a revival of cosmopolitan ideas and feelings as a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall (which seemed to have confirmed liberal democracy as a dominant ideology) and the globalisation of world politics. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.14">These factors have urged a re-conceptualisation of state-sovereignty (in post-Westphalian<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.006"/> terms) and of political community.<ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.007"/> Enthusiasts have seen globalisation as the political challenge that gives impetus for the expansion of liberal democracy, and the creation of cosmopolitan citizenship. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p3.14">The emergence of various other governing actors in the arena of world politics avoids a monopoly of power so detrimental to democracy. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.14">State sovereignty is undermined since states are sandwiched between local (sub-national) and supra-state actors empowered through the processes of globalisation. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.14">Political power is being diffused downwards and upwards while state power appears now only one dimension of political power and not the single relevant one as realists have argued. <ref target="BAWE_0195a-ftnote.008"/> </s>
