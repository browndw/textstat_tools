<s n="s1.2;p1.50">Since the end of the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, scientists have experimented with how to best alleviate discomfort and rehabilitate joints struck with arthritis. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.50">The joint that is hardest struck is usually the hip, and accordingly research has been more focussed in this area. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.50">
<s n="s1.3;p2.50">A complete hip replacement is required to reproduce the kind of mobility offered by the original hip. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.50">For this, two primary components are used, the cup to replicate the hip socket, and the femur, including the ball to rotate within the socket. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.50">In practise, the ball is attached separately onto the femur replacement to allow the use of harder wearing materials, and often the cup has a lining to improve longevity and decrease friction within the joint. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p13.50">
<hi rend="bold">1925</hi> - in Boston a scientist pioneered "mold arthroplasty", initially a piece of glass was successfully molded to fit over the ball of the hip joint providing a smooth surface to replace the worn one. </s>

<hi rend="bold">1938</hi> - In Paris, acrylic was used to replace hip surfaces. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.50">This proved successful in terms of wear, but fixation to the bone was difficult but inspired a New York scientist to successfully utilise fast setting dental acrylic to glue the new surface to the bone. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p16.50">
<hi rend="bold">1940's</hi> - Mold arthroplasty is considered an technically advanced procedure </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.50">
<hi rend="bold">1950's</hi> - In New York, Hemiarthroplasty (the replacement of the ball of the hip) included a stem that attached at one end to the femur, and the other end to the ball. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p17.50">Problems arose within the socket, and with attaching the prosthesis to the bone. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.50">
<s n="s1.4;p18.50">
<hi rend="bold">1958</hi> - In England, John Charnley worked towards replacing both parts of the joint, the femoral head and the hip socket. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p19.50">This is necessary to overcome difficulties with fixation techniques which continue to prove problematic over long periods. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.50">Traditionally design validation has required surgically implanting the prosthesis in a patient and monitoring progress. </s>

<p n="p20.50">
<s n="s1.3;p20.50">Recent improvements upon John Charnley's total hip replacement have in part been achieved by better modelling the original hip joint. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.50">Using CAD and FEA, it is possible to 'scan' a three dimensional model from a human joint, and create a solid within the software package that is a virtual copy of the bone itself. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.50">Loads can be applied to the model and the deformation and stress contours be calculated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.50">
<s n="s1.2;p21.50">Designs can therefore be verified and tested in a virtual world without any need for prototyping at this stage. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.50">It is possible to subject the model to cyclical loading at a far greater rate than a real-world equivalent model, proving longevity or fatigue failures of any design. </s>

<p n="p24.50">
<s n="s1.2;p24.50">Forces were selected to best model the loading that the hip would be subjected to in real use (i.e. if it were it used to replace someone's hip). </s>
