<s n="s1.3;p1.73">Kirtlington Golf Club is a privately owned golf club located close to Kidlington in Oxfordshire. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.73">The golf club is member orientated, but welcomes members of the public to use its facilities. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.73">This development plan will be concentrating on the restaurant within the golf club. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.73">
<s n="s1.8;p2.73">The restaurant is made up of a lounge/restaurant and a separate bar, called the "Spike Bar." </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.73">The restaurant has a maximum capacity of 120, but it is generally set up for 50 covers. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.73">The Spike bar seats around 20 people. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.73">Although called a restaurant, the room is multi-functional, and can be used for parties, meetings, conferences and dinners. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.73">The restaurant is open from 8am daily until dusk, although it can stay open later if requested and pre-arranged. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.73">This happens more frequently for golfing societies who combine golf with a meal (Appendix 1). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.73">Members of the club and the public can also hold events in the restaurant, but it's not advertised. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.73">A point to note is that if the public do use the restaurant as a venue, then the members can't be excluded from the club house, and have to have access to the Spike Bar. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.73">
<s n="s1.7;p3.73">Food is served throughout the day from a bar menu (Appendix 2). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.73">Food is ordered at the bar. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.73">The food is very traditional sporting English food, and quite basic. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.73">Examples include bacon rolls, burgers and sausage and mash. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.73">However, the menu available to the societies and events (Appendix 3) for pre-order is far more varied than the normal bar menu. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.73">Alcoholic beverages are available as well as soft drinks and hot drinks. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.73">The alcohol license runs until 12 midnight. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.73">
<s n="s1.7;p4.73">The main target markets for the restaurant are the members of the golf club and the societies that visit from all over the country. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.73">The majority of the members that use the restaurant are seniors (40% of golf club members), most of whom are men. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.73">At the weekend, there tends to be a younger crowd in the restaurant, both members of the club and the public. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.73">The younger people tend to be around more at the weekend as they're working in the week. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.73">Although members are the most frequent users of the restaurant, they are by no means the biggest spenders. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.73">The group spending the largest amount of money is the societies. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.73">At the weekend, a large sum of money is made from members of the public. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p5.73">There are four steps to planning and using a PESTE analysis (Kotler, Bowen and Makens, 2003). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.73">These steps are determining the factors that are relevant to the business, then deciding how to collect the information, then implementing the data collection plan, and finally analysing the data. </s>
