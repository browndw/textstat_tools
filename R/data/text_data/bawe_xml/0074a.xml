<p>Filtered monochromatic light was shone on the potassium cathode of an evacuated photocell. The stopping voltage which prevented flow of photoelectrons to the anode, was measured across a capacitor in series with the photocell at different at frequencies of light, and this data was used to calculate a value for Planck's constant.</p>
<p>The value obtained was 4.61 x 10 <hi rend="sup">-34</hi> Js (±0.48x10 <hi rend="sup">-34</hi> Js). This was not consistent with the value given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of 6.62606876 x 10 <hi rend="sup">-34</hi> Js (± 0.52 x 10 <hi rend="sup">-40</hi>Js).</p>
<p>It was concluded that a leakage current through the capacitor across which the stopping voltage was measured, was the primary cause of this discrepancy.</p>
