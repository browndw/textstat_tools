<p>The lattice types and lattice parameters for 2 unknown samples were determined by analysis of diffraction patterns created as a result of x-ray powder diffraction. Secondly the lattice parameter for a mixed sample composed of KBr and KCl was obtained. Vegard's Law was then tested using this sample.</p>
<p>Sample 1 had a face-centred cubic structure and a lattice parameter of</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051b-form.001"/>
</p>
<p>This value is higher than the accepted value and hence when it was used to identify the sample, identification was not possible.</p>
<p>Sample 2 had a simple cubic structure and a lattice parameter of</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051b-form.002"/>
</p>
<p>This value is in agreement with the accepted value and the sample was identified as <hi rend="italic">sodium chlorate</hi>.</p>
<p>By analysing high scattering angles, a more accurate value for <hi rend="italic">a</hi> was obtained:</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051b-form.003"/>
</p>
<p>This result contained a considerably smaller error of 0.037%</p>
<p>For the mixed sample the lattice parameter was</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051b-form.004"/>
</p>
<p>This point lay on the theoretical linear plot and so supported Vegard's Law.</p>
