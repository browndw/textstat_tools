<s n="s1.5;p39.43">The NMR data presented by Hull and Stiddard, 1967 conclusively proves the trihaptic nature of the bonding and the delocalized nature of the π system. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p40.43">Molybdenum being in group 6 has the valence configuration 5s <hi rend="sup">2</hi>4d <hi rend="sup">4</hi>, which in the coordination complex, hexacarbonyl Mo(0) has the configuration 4d <hi rend="sup">6</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p40.43">There are 6 carbonyl ligands, each bonded to the central metal contributing 2 electrons each per bond, giving 12 electrons. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p40.43">This added to the 4d <hi rend="sup">6</hi> configuration gives 18 electrons, therefore obeying the 18 electron rule. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.43">
<s n="s1.2;p41.43">The complex Tetracarbonyl bipy Mo(0), two of the carbonyl ligands (2 electron donors) are replaced by the bidentate 2,2-bipyridyl ligands which donates a total of four electrons. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.43">Thus this also has 18 electrons. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.43">
<s n="s1.10;p42.43">The product complex is more difficult. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p42.43">If the molybdenum where assigned the oxidation state of (II), it would possess the configuration of 4d <hi rend="sup">4</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p42.43">There are 2 carbonyl ligands (4 electrons), one bidentate 2,2-bipyridyl (4 electrons) and one thiocyanato ligand (2 electrons). </s>
<s n="s4.10;p42.43">This is 14 electrons. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p42.43">The allyl anion bonds trihaptically and so contributes 3 electrons. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p42.43">This gives 17 electrons and is not correct. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p42.43">An alternative approach is to assign an oxidation state of (0) to the metal centre. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p42.43">In the complex, it is convenient to consider the ligands as neutral and then to begin counting electrons. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p42.43">For reasons of energetics it is most favourable for the ground state of Molybdenum to have only unpaired electrons so the electron spins can be parallel - this gives rise to the configuration 5s <hi rend="sup">1</hi>4d <hi rend="sup">5</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p42.43">So now, with 5 electron on the metal species, 4 from 2 carbonyls, 4 from the 2,2-bipyridyl, 2 from the thiocyanate and 3 from the η<hi rend="sup">3</hi>-allyl ligand gives 18! </s>

<p n="p43.43">
<s n="s1.1;p43.43">Hence, all three species conform to the 18 electron rule. </s>
