<s n="s5.10;p3.14">There are two relevant intellectual virtues - the task of practical reason is to determine which actions will lead to eudaimonia and the task of theoretical reason is to discover necessary and eternal truths. </s>

<s n="s8.10;p3.14">The person of practical wisdom possesses all of the virtues/character traits human beings need in order to 'flourish' (lead a good human life and to achieve eudaimonia). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p3.14">This good human life must be attainable, final, and self-sufficient. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p3.14">Since reason operates in both the practical and theoretical sphere, one form of human activity displaying reason including excellence of character is good action. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.14">Aristotle arrives at his definition of eudaimonia by considering mans function/ergon.<ref target="BAWE_3145c-ftnote.002"/> Aristotle argues that reason is central to a good human life because it is our function/ergon. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p7.14">Philosophical contemplation is the highest and best activity that a man is capable of. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.14">Its objects are eternal and unchanging and is an activity that can be attributed to God himself as God is the supremely eudaimon being. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.14">A life of contemplation is above the human level but it is argued that we should still try to achieve it. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.14">Man has a limited capacity for intuitive reason. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.14">Since intuitive reason is in man and God is intuitive reason, there is a divine element<ref target="BAWE_3145c-ftnote.004"/> in man, this divine element is superior to our composite human nature, so its activity (contemplation) is superior to activity displaying the other aspect of excellence (good action). </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.14">Everything finds best and pleasantest what is truly its own therefore the life of reason is best for man (since reason is mans ergon) and consequently the happiest. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.14">In Book I of the "Nicomachean Ethics" Aristotle characterises human flourishing as excellent spiritual or mental activity and if there are several forms of excellence, spiritual activity expressing the best, most final excellence. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.14">In Book X Aristotle identifies the best excellence to be the best thing is us - theoretical wisdom. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.14">In considering the good man Aristotle appears uncertain regarding either an inclusive or exclusive formulation. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.14">What is unsatisfactory about the "Nicomachean Ethics" is Aristotle's failure to make explicit the distinction between the comprehensive life plan and the paramount end. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.14">Therefore it is often argued the two concepts Aristotle presents regarding eudaimonia are extremely difficult to reconcile. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p8.14">It is questioned whether the function argument supports the claim that eudaimonia is the life of contemplation. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.14">Aristotle defines reason to include not only theoretical and practical reason but also our emotions and desires as long as they can 'listen to reason'. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.14">This is distinctive of human beings. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.14">The ergon argument prompts us to discover a man's excellence and his good is practical reason. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.14">However the contemplation theory tells us instead that to identify ourselves with the divine element, we have to pursue an activity that is not exclusive to man but is shared with God. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.14">Here a conflict arises between the two types of ideal - the ideal for a harmonious yet human form of life against a 'higher' ideal of a more demanding kind. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.14">
<s n="s1.10;p9.14">Criticisms have been raised in response to the contemplative life theory. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p9.14">It has been implied that Aristotle is advising us to spend as little time as possible on activities other than contemplation and to attach no importance to practical or moral concerns.<ref target="BAWE_3145c-ftnote.005"/> Ideally it seems one should neglect friends and family to concentrate on ones private intellectual life. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p9.14">A typical response is for one to meet the needs of ones moral life and then to concentrate on contemplation. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p9.14">However, I do not find this to be a satisfactory response as one cannot fully meet their moral requirements and still have time to successfully pursue contemplation. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p9.14">The man who is truly kind, brave, generous etc will be fully occupied exercising these virtues. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p9.14">Also, if contemplation is the highest activity, it is not evident why the needs of the moral life should take precedence. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p9.14">It is evident the moral life is not just practical activity that is practiced insofar as it is sufficient to keep one alive and in a position to pursue contemplation. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.14">Such activities are time consuming as they are concerned with the welfare of others, yet if theoretical activity is the dominant end it is not evident why displays of practical virtue should be prioritised above philosophical contemplation. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p9.14">Aristotle does not respond to this himself but one suggestion designed to connect morality and contemplation is that the very aim of morality is the promotion of contemplation, what makes a type of action good is its tendency to promote contemplation. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p9.14">Here the ultimate justification for the necessity of characteristics of the good man is that general adherence to the rules he abides by would maximise the amount of contemplation possible in the community. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p10.14">One interpretation regarding Aristotle's account of eudaimonia implies that to live a truly flourishing life, morally virtuous activities should only be engaged in insofar as it contributes to nurturing ones intellect<ref target="BAWE_3145c-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.14">I do not find this to be an accurate interpretation of Aristotle's account of eudaimonia as one who actually followed this life could be viewed as less than morally respectable, being dominantly concerned with ones intellectual accomplishments would give the implication that it could occasionally seem rational to neglect performing virtuous acts to further one's theoretical contemplation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.14">One would therefore follow a retiring, contemplative life with no concern for values of social, political and family life. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.14">Some have responded to this criticism by maintaining the successful contemplative will always be morally virtuous as the committed intellectualist will never consider it rational to neglect conducting virtuous action as it is a necessary means to furthering the life of contemplation<ref target="BAWE_3145c-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.14">However this response appears contradictory as if it is accepted that virtuous activity should only be engaged in as long as it contributes to nurturing ones intellect then virtuous action that does not contribute to furthering intellect should logically be neglected. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p11.14">He will not possess virtues as he will lack the commitment needed for the type of activity that is an essential characteristic of the virtuous person, therefore the intellectual life does not involve possession of moral virtues. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.14">However I do not believe this to be an adequate interpretation of Aristotle's understanding of eudaimonia as Aristotle devotes the majority of the "Nicomachean Ethics" to discussing the importance of the practice of moral virtues. </s>
