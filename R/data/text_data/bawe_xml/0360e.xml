<p n="p1.25">
<s n="s1.4;p1.25">The efficacy of human rights law as a tool for women's empowerment has been vigorously debated over the past several decades. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.25">This article explores this debate focusing on the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.25">The extensive literature that has been devoted to this practice and grown throughout the 1990s and the wide-ranging impact that this practice has on wide range of planes from the legal, to the political and the cultural, makes it an ideal case study for an examination of both the advantages and drawbacks of using international human rights law in the struggle for women's human rights. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.25">The cultural and religious significance of FGM, its strong links to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and the critiques raised by postcolonial feminists in particular on the dangers of gender essentialism and exclusive focus on violence against women has made FGM a contentious and vigorously debated topic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.4;p2.25">In the first part of this article, I briefly examine how the practice of FGM gained prominence in the international women's human rights movement. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.25">I summarize some of the contentious issues that FGM has raised, particularly the criticism that the FGM campaign essentializes both gender and culture. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.25">In the second part of the article, I discuss the role of UN treaty bodies and their articulation of FGM as a human right violation through concluding observations on state reports, and explore whether such exchanges between state officials and committee members provide meaningful dialogue that has an impact on the ground. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.25">Finally, I argue that a current gap in the literature on FGM, particularly that written from the international human rights law perspective, is a failure to take sufficient account of the wider social constraints that restrict women's ability to enjoy their rights pronounced under human rights instruments. </s>

<head rend="bold">FGM's Rise to Prominence: Violence against Women</head>
<p n="p3.25">
<s n="s1.2;p3.25">When at the 1993 Human Rights Conference in Vienna, the slogan 'women's rights are human rights' became a reality, gender-based violence as a major human rights issue also took off and was the culmination of many decades of activism and lobbying.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.001"/> Another watershed was the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, and the 1995 Fourth World Conference in Beijing which brought to the forefront issues regarding women's reproductive health and choices.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.002"/> It is particularly important to examine the struggle against FGM within the context of gender-based violence and women's sexual and reproductive health campaigns, which these conferences brought to the forefront. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.25">Although activists and women's rights advocates had written about the practice much earlier<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.003"/>, it was only in the 1990s that a concerted, vigorous and international campaign against FGM truly gained momentum capturing the attention of human rights activists and academics, UN bodies and the media. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s2.2;p4.25">According to the WHO, FGM has both immediate and long-term health consequences in addition to physical, psychosexual and psychological effects.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.005"/> For this reason, FGM fits well into both the gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive rights and health; not only is it physically injurious and hence a violent act against women but it has the potential to affect women's sexual and reproductive lives and choices. </s>

<head rend="italic">FGM and the Culture Debate</head>
<p n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.3;p5.25">Questions such as does FGM constitute torture, can and should a cultural and religious practice be vehemently condemned as a human rights violation, is the focus on FGM a Western fetish and what measures, if any, can be taken to deconstruct a deeply embedded practice are just a few examples of the contentious issues raised in the struggle against FGM.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.006"/> At the heart of the debate is the construction of cultural and traditional practices and its impact on women. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.25">The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) makes clear that culture, tradition and religion cannot be used as an excuse to deprive women of their rights, the implication being that it is largely these three elements that keep women in subordinate positions.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.007"/> Sally Engle Merry examines the use of 'culture' and 'tradition' within the discourse of human rights arguing that feminist and human rights scholars and activists "identify culture and tradition as the source of the problem." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s3.3;p5.25">Merry describes FGM (or female genital cutting as she names it) as "the poster child for this understanding of culture"<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.009"/> where culture plays a harmful and oppressive role through its subordination of women, and further elaborates how FGM "became the prototype of a practice justified by custom and culture and redefined as an act of violence."<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<p n="p6.25">
<s n="s1.3;p6.25">Postcolonial feminism adds an additional dimension to the controversy surrounding FGM by raising questions about the process of legalization of human rights, the assumptions made about gender and culture and the tendency to universalize women's experiences and universalize solutions.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.011"/> FGM is particularly sensitive to this kind of critique and activists have noted the tendency to sensationalize and oversimplify FGM in Western circles. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.25">Toubia has stated how FGM is portrayed "as irrefutable evidence of the barbarism and vulgarity of underdeveloped countries"<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.012"/>, and Seif El Dawla has similarly noted how activists like her are "constantly trying to make others understand that women who circumcise their daughters are not barbarians or vampires (134). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.25">Moreover, Mugo argues that FGM has been uprooted from its context with the effect of reducing African women's struggle to effectively one issue.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.013"/> </s>

<s n="s2.4;p7.25">Obiora points out that FGM can be considered a "form of self-assertion, or even the ultimate expression of their personhood." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s3.4;p7.25">Some women also argue that by decreasing a women's sexual needs she will actually become more powerful and less at the mercy of her husband.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.015"/> Others prefer the appearance of circumcised genitals and claim that they still experience sexual pleasure and orgasm.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.016"/> These narratives are often very hard for feminists to swallow. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.25">Indeed, researchers on the IRRRAG project admitted the presence of an "avoidable tension" when doing research on the cross-cultural meanings of reproductive rights asking themselves, "what if women's voices tell us things we would rather not hear, or simply cannot hear - because they express values and priorities that are different from those we espouse?<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.017"/> Philosopher Diana Meyers has also argued that "the feminist literature on the [practice] provides ample evidence that many exercise effective agency" and "autonomy is to be found among accommodaters as well as resisters.<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.018"/> Invariably however when such voices do emerge, it is often argued that patriarchal assumptions underlie such acceptance and that the 'choice' women exercise in performing FGM "is not truly meaningful, but...shaped by a male dominated culture." <ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.019"/> </s>

<s n="s2.3;p9.25">State reporting mechanisms are one of the means used to monitor state compliance with treaty obligations, which also allows experts sitting on the various treaty body committees to engage in a dialogue with states to determine what progress has or has not been made, what measures have been taken to implement the treaties, and what obstacles exist and their possible remedies, in addition to the adoption of concluding observations and comments on state reports. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p25.25">International human rights law is only one of several tools that should be used to combat the practice of FGM. The challenged faced is "not only one of opposing harmful practices or mobilizing around rights but of publicly deconstructing the ideological and social system...that makes those practices acceptable and sometimes even desired." </s>

<s n="s2.4;p25.25">Ultimately the task of public deconstruction will not take place at international conferences or in UN forums but at the grassroots level. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.25">An-Na'im argues persuasively that, "unless international human rights have sufficient legitimacy within particular cultures and traditions, their implementation will be thwarted." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0360e-ftnote.047"/>
<s n="s4.4;p25.25">Not only is legitimacy of human rights law needed, but also a recognition that this law's efficacy is contingent on adopting a broader socioeconomic scheme. </s>
