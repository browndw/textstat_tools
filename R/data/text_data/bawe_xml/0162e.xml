<head rend="bold">Discussion</head>
<p n="p20.30">
<s n="s1.6;p20.30">The number of observation for each sample is too small (only 3 to 4 observations), thus it is hard to get any conclusive result, either applying statistical tests or doing graph illustration. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p20.30">For example, when we were doing <hi rend="italic">t</hi> test for comparison between the control and strains, the degree of freedom for the statistic t is only 3+3 (at most), which is not so informative compared with large sample comparison. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.30">Also, for test normality, 4 data is far from enough to show normality, since a theorem ([2]) states that there should be at least 8 data all being on one side of the normal distribution that could prove nonnormality of the data points. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.30">QQ plot is also not so conclusive with only three or four data points distributed around the straight line. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.30">A suggestion is to take more observations over each sample, even though it is very expensive to repeat the experiment many times. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p20.30">There is tradeoff anyway, so we should consider the marginal gain of the statistical information with respect to the marginal price of doing more experiment, and find an optimal number of repeating. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.30">
<s n="s1.2;p21.30">An alternative way not to do so many t test for each pair of sample, we can do ANOVA to test the equality of all the mean of the control chip and the four strains for each gene, with F statistics. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.30">The general null hypothesis for F statistic is: </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.30">
<s n="s1.1;p22.30">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0162e-form.003"/>, </s>

<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0162e-form.004"/>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.30">
<s n="s1.2;p25.30">Only when F statistic shows significantly difference between those k variables, can we then apply <hi rend="italic">t</hi> test to see which pair(s) of combination is(are) significantly different. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.30">Applying F test may save us a lot of time for our gene expression analysis, especially with multiple comparisons of different experiment results with the control. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.30">
<s n="s1.4;p26.30">We don't know whether we can do t test for this microarray, since the requirement for a t test is equal variance and normally distributed. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.30">To test equal variance, F test can be applied. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.30">However, still because there are too few observations, this test cannot tell too much. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.30">So, we assume all data is sampled on a random basis and normally distributed, with equal variance for each sample. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.30">
<s n="s1.3;p27.30">Comparing our results with what was obtained in the reference paper ([1]), the number of significantly different gene expression is smaller in our test than that in the paper. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.30">This may due to different statistical software we used and different and different values for the significant level. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p29.30">We used <hi rend="italic">t</hi> test to see whether the infected cell strains (FDR) would have the same mean of gene expression level as uninfected cells (control). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.30">There are a total of 2493 statistically significant changes (1304 up-regulated, 1189 down-regulated) in gene expression in response to the motile strains, FDR440, while only 2135 statistically significant changes were observed in response to the isogenic mutant, FDR1234. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.30">Further the more, the conversion of <hi rend="italic">P. aeruginosa</hi> to a mucoid phenotype, such as what takes place in CF (FDR1), resulted in only 2254 statistically significant changes( 1225 up-regulated, 1029 down-regulated) in gene expression. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.30">Remarkably, our transcriptional profile analysis shows that a nonmucoid and nonmotile strain (FDR875) regulates the expression of 2363 gene in airway epithelial cells. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p30.30">We also discussed the situation when <hi rend="italic">t</hi> test is applicable. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.30">Since the number of observation is too limited to do the normality test, we can only assume that each sample follows the Normal. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.30">Finally, we use QQ plot to show whether each sample have the same distribution, and the result is not conclusive since the number of observation is too small. </s>
