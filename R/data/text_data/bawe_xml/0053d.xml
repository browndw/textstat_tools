<s n="s1.5;p8.20">According to The Economist, Americans like the British have realized that their system of large "one-size-fit- all" public schools was failing badly.<ref target="BAWE_0053d-ftnote.003"/> America spends about 8.2% of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) on education, significantly more per head than the international average and far more than countries such as Hungary and Singapore whose schools do better.<ref target="BAWE_0053d-ftnote.004"/> In Britain, it appears as if the money poured into education was going to waste. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.20">Inputs have been increasing by around 2% for the past ten years but outputs have only increased by 1% a year, implying that productivity has been falling by around 1% a year.<ref target="BAWE_0053d-ftnote.005"/> Public organizations, according to Alchian, do not directly concentrate the cost and benefits on decision makers. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.20">Hence they have an incentive to shirk. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.20">The market process, on the other hand, forces schools to compete for students and schools inept at providing services would lose their 'customers' (students) to other schools.<ref target="BAWE_0053d-ftnote.006"/> The organization of public schools protects educators from such competition because payments are not made directly by the students receiving the services, nor do public employees bear the consequence of poor service. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.20">By contrasting private and public educational systems with data on 59,000 high school students, Coleman et al (1982) found that, after controlling for family background variables that predict achievement, children attending private schools learn at a faster rate.<ref target="BAWE_0053d-ftnote.007"/> Therefore the evidence, in agreement with the First Welfare Theorem, suggests that public provision is costly not only in terms of current expenditure but also in terms of forgone investment in human capital. </s>
