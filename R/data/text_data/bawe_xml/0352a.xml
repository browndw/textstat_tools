<p n="p1.18">
<s n="s1.4;p1.18">The alleviation of human misery through medical science has an abstract element that transcends the mundane, thus does not lend itself easily to practical analysis particularly in conjunction with legal regulation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.18">This abstract element is contained within moral constraints on the freedom of science and any regulations must balance these two competing interests through carefully constructed ethical guidelines to protect individuals and society and to facilitate research and testing. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.18">This essay seeks to ground the debate with an exposition of the controversies surrounding the use of human embryological stem cells in research to better elucidate these abstract concepts and considerations.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.001"/> The legal framework provides an illuminating insight into the UK's attempt to balance competing interests between science and morality. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.18">As such the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 will be considered along with further primary and secondary legislation and caselaw. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">This is a somewhat arbitrary choice as stem cell research is by no means the only topical area that would ground these abstract concepts; IVF treatment more generally, and in particular processes like Pre-Genetic Implantation Diagnosis (PGD) which aid the creation of so-called saviour siblings or designer babies; new techniques in organ and tissue transplantation; the use of incapacitated adults in research or as donors; all of these and many more are firmly part of the wider debate. </s>
</p>

<p n="p2.18">
<s n="s1.3;p2.18">It is asserted that the UK has one of the most liberal regulatory systems for these techniques. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.18">However the current regulations are by no means clear, cohesive or consistent, and any balance between competing ideologies could be questioned. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.18">As a global civilisation we hold answers to the immutable secrets of nature in such research, but the socio-legal ramifications of this could be further reaching than we allow. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">2.1 Science vs. Morality</head>
<p n="p3.18">
<s n="s1.4;p3.18">Since the Enlightenment science and morality have wrestled for competing claims to legitimacy in the public arena. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.18">Morality has oft been seen as the domain of the Church, and thus theology plays a central role in this debate; reason and logic does not understand faith and belief, and divine truth will not accept empirical observation.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.002"/> In the middle stands philosophy.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.003"/> In the medical field this is most acutely apparent as the human body is the most notable site at which these opposing ideologies converge. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.18">To facilitate medical research within acceptable parameters of morality, ethical guidelines and regulations have matured which seek to balance theological and philosophical concerns with the philosophy underpinning science, that of rational and objective freedom in the pursuit of knowledge. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.18">Thus medical ethics plays a central role in informing policy in this area. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p4.18">Most ethical theories are rooted in two key philosophical theories, utilitarianism and Kantianism, the most notable of which in bioethics are, respectively, consequentialism and deontology. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.18">Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the principle of utility as a model of social action and formulated an algorithm he called the felicific calculus as part of his project to make morals amenable to scientific treatment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.18">The felicific calculus worked out the degree of happiness that a specific action is likely to cause, and so its degree of moral rightness. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.18">As consequentialism<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.004"/> is rooted in utilitarianism it refers to those theories that place emphasis on the consequences of any action, as opposed to other normative criteria; the outcome of any action determines its morality. </s>

<p n="p5.18">
<s n="s1.5;p5.18">Deontology on the other hand focuses on the types of actions; some actions are implicitly good or bad regardless of the consequences. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.18">This reasoning was first seen in the work of Immanuel Kant who proposed the categorical imperative, an indisputable duty to promote human rationality and freedom based on <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> reasoning of the general nature of things. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.18">The fundamental difference between these positions is that whilst consequentialism conceives <hi rend="italic">the right</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the good</hi> to be synonymous, deontology distinguishes between them thus an action that is good may not be right. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.18">Rule consequentialism does not see these positions as mutually exclusive. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.18">Here actions must follow immutable rules but those rules are chosen based on the consequences, although the absolute nature of these rules is debated<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.005"/>. </s>

<p n="p6.18">
<s n="s1.2;p6.18">These fundamental ethical positions illuminate the debate on the regulation of new medical technologies as it is not only the policy that is informed by them but the regulations themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.18">An apt area in which this application can be seen is the topical debate on the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in medical research as it has been widely acknowledged that the investigations in this area have huge therapeutic potential for diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.006"/> However, the interference with principles such as the sanctity of life and bodily integrity make this a very controversial area of study. </s>

<p n="p7.18">
<s n="s1.2;p7.18">Human embryonic stem cell research is currently a salient element in the advancement of medical technology to alleviate human misery. hESCs are pluripotent cells meaning they have the potential to develop into any cell type through differentiation, a process where less specialised cells develop into more specialised cells through expressing or repressing different subsets of genes within the individual cells. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.18">Embryo-derived stem cells are not alone with this potential; adult somatic stem cells such as those found in bone marrow may also be used but the properties of this type of cell become increasingly restrictive with tissue development, hence hESCs provide the best prospects for curative therapies.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.007"/> </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.18">
<s n="s1.7;p8.18">However, the use of hESCs has reopened the debate on embryonic technologies since it necessarily involves the use and destruction of embryos. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.18">This is further complicated with the successful application of cell nuclear replacement (CNR)<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.008"/>, a type of cloning that replaces the nucleus of an egg with an adult cell. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.18">The cytoplasm within the egg reprogrammes the adult nucleus allowing it to behave as if it were in a one cell embryo. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.18">Therapeutic cloning uses CNR to procure embryos that at the blastocyst stage can derive stem cells from the inner cell mass. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.18">This is at about 4-5 days into development where an a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass forms the embryo which is suspended in fluid and surrounded by an outer cell layer which will form the placenta. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.18">These stem cells derived from the inner cell mass can then be induced to produce any cells from within the body, for example dopamine-producing neurons that are lacking in the brains of Parkinson's disease sufferers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.18">As the process does not require fertilisation, CNR has provided an effective source of embryos that does not rely on limited surplus quantities donated following successful IVF treatment. </s>

<p n="p9.18">
<s n="s1.5;p9.18">In the UK the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (HFE Act) lays out the procedural safeguards for the use of human cells in research and therapy, thus it is the primary source of legal reference for geneticists. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.18">The legal bright line adopted by the Act draws upon a special status afforded to hESCs as suggested by the Warnock Report<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.18">Ethical boundaries were drawn regarding the stage of embryonic development to be reached before destruction. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.18">Thus the HFE Act asserts an embryo must be destroyed within 14 days of fertilisation or on appearance of the primitive streak, as after 14 days pluripotent cells develop along determinate lines and the formation of an individual organism is begun. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.18">This was considered a suitable compromise to differentiate between an organism that can be manipulated to provide curative treatments for millions of people, and an organism that could be considered to have begun life. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p10.18">A further ethical boundary is the purpose of the research. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p10.18">The theme running through all of them is to only use hESCs for sufficiently serious research to further the global knowledge of genetics in the direction of alleviating certain causes of human misery. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.18">Both of these boundaries suggest a consequentialist perspective was adopted as the sanctity of life, generally considered an absolute moral principle, is sought to be offset against the greater good. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.18">However, the philosophical ideologies are not in harmony it may be argued balance was struck through these restrictions as a political middle ground has been sought, and once introduced, was widely accepted amongst the public. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.18">What aided this process was the long and detailed consultation period before the HFE Act was introduced, something that lent legitimacy to the outcome of the regulations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.18">
<s n="s1.3;p11.18">However, this public acceptance has since been tested as the Act has required reconsideration on the issue of CNR. The source of the embryo is another way in which boundaries for research may be drawn, and although the UK has thus far stood with international consensus<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.010"/> that reproductive cloning should be prohibited,<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.011"/> it stands alone within the Europe on permitting the creation of human embryos specifically for research purposes, including with cloning techniques. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.18">This is a somewhat more liberal approach to determining ethical boundaries than was afforded by the regulations on the stage of development and purposes of research, and the legislative procedure through which this passed was neither long nor detailed resulting in a strained interpretation of the Act. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p15.18">This breakdown in consistency and coherence within the legal framework is symptomatic of what has been termed the 'genetic exceptionalism'<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.021"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.18">New technologies are being developed at a rate with which the law cannot compete.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.022"/> The balance sought through informed debate, as was seen in the Warnock Report and the subsequent legislation, cannot be maintained and neither can the law's proactive regulatory hold on genetics, thus a new approach must be considered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.18">The chaotic characteristic of genetic research through constant innovation is fundamentally de-stabilising and 'embodies a tendency to break down the foundational categories and boundaries underpinning and taken for granted within the law, for example... the meaning attributed to 'embryo'', whereas law, in ethos at least, is a stabilising societal institutional.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.023"/> As such genetics and the law are fundamentally at odds, and it has been suggested that genetics is exemplary of the law's relationship with all science.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.024"/> As such it may be that the law has to adapt more than it ever has before to envisage a regulatory future with science generally, and medical science specifically. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.18">In light of these arguments it must be questioned how a meaningful and internally cohesive system of regulation can be devised to reach the aim of balancing the interests of science and morality. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.18">As it stands, the development of new medical technologies to alleviate human misery are inhibited more by the lack of a consistent regulatory framework than they are by over-regularisation. </s>

<quote lang="English">'Regulation should fill the gap between science and society; science and the individual; and science and other disciplines, including law, each of which have there own language, facilitating debate and reflecting the conclusions of that debate.' </quote>
<p n="p17.18">
<s n="s1.3;p17.18">Without clarity and consistency it is difficult, if not impossible, to encourage informed debate on an area such as hESC research as there is no common ground from which to work. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.18">Halliday and Steinberg recognise the need for the view of 'scientists being objective and of non-scientists being irrational or merely ignorant'<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.026"/> must be expelled. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p18.18">Roger Brownsword suggests using the teleological approach would be appropriate to not only create such a framework but to underpin the social function of regulation itself.<ref target="BAWE_0352a-ftnote.027"/> The 'regulatory connection', the balance between flexibility and certainty and generally and specifically applicable regulations, would be afforded through this approach. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p18.18">They would argue that the whole question of genetic exceptionalism needs unpacking, with particular regard to the tumultuous relationship of law and science, and how this illuminates the law's limitations in other spheres. </s>
