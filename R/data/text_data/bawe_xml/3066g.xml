<s n="s5.6;p1.17">He argues that the novel form is unsuitable for accurately representing the experience of modern life, 'because the <hi rend="italic">era</hi> that made it possible is undergoing a crisis and has been transformed into 'a panorama of futility and anarchy''.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.002"/> In part agreement to Eliot, this essay proposes that during the modern era fiction began to abandon imposed form in an attempt to express the freedom of contemporary life. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.17">But it does not reject all form per se; Alan Friedman notes that 'since the taut and highly conceptualized structures of James, we are often confronted by a fiction whose frames, while mattering greatly, are largely hidden'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.003"/> In the essay I am going to consider: 1) logical progression and conclusion (or lack of), 2) choice of narrator, 3) the motif, 4) stream of consciousness and 5) form as genre in Conrad's <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi>, Ford's <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> and Joyce's <hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi>. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p2.17">In contrast, modernist texts tend to reject the simple form of the story. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.17">Instead many employ a non-chronological or fugal time sequence - this is certainly true for <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi>. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p3.17">But rather than being a sign of Ford's inadequate authorial skill, this illustrates that modern life is too chaotic (in Eliot's terms an 'immense panorama') to make sense of by attempting to order it. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.17">Likewise, the structural and textural form of <hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi> is broken up by allusion and documentation, for example extracts from nursery rhymes, songs, or from the bible, and references to Shelley and Nash. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.17">At one point there is a letter format, as Stephen imagines writing a short letter to his mother, and his diary extract in the last chapter is not to be forgotten. </s>

<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.10;p4.17">Therefore Aristotle's notion of a linear beginning-middle-end plot sequence is absent from all three texts. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p4.17">
<hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> is in its most literal sense a journey that ends where it starts. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.17">The crew on board the Nellie are stationary throughout and consequently do not make any progress. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.17">Although Marlow progresses psychologically through a journey into the self, his physical journey is still mapped by a cycle, from the Thames to the Belgian Congo and back. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.17">In <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> the reader is told the final outcome at the beginning; we are informed of Florence's death no later than in the second paragraph, of Edward's in the fourth, and of the affair by the fourth page. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.17">In this respect the beginning-middle-end structure is reversed. </s>

<s n="s9.10;p4.17">The cycle structure adopted by the texts is significant, as it reflects Eliot's concerns about the futility of contemporary history. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.17">The only meaningful progression, if any, is personal and psychological, perhaps at the expense of societal progress. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.17">A cyclical pattern is clear in <hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi>, as Stephen's process of self-realisation is structured by a series of epiphanies - recurring flashes of intellectual clarity linked to a sense of light. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.17">Each chapter builds up to the epiphany as a final climax, only to be undermined in the next chapter. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.17">For example in a prostitute's 'warm and lightsome' room at the end of chapter 2 Stephen feels as though 'he had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.009"/> Yet at the beginning of chapter 3 we are told that 'the stars began to crumble' and 'a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.010"/> The fact that the truth is only seen momentarily (in this case during an epiphany), and that it can turn out to be false, supports the concept of partial reality. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p6.17">By using an unreliable narrator Ford dissociates both himself as author from his protagonist and us as reader from the story, an effect Conrad also reaches, but by different means. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.17">The opening of <hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> is spoken by an anonymous frame narrator to distance the reader from Marlow's story, including its implied message from Kurtz. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p7.17">
<hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi> has no definite ending, as Stephen is preparing for exile, but it starts with one of the most clichéd openings; 'Once upon a time...'. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Heart of Darkness</hi> ends by returning to the darkness - 'the tranquil waterway...seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.012"/> Conrad's ending is disconcerting, particularly as he uses darkness to symbolise obscurity and uncertainty. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.17">The light/dark contrast runs throughout the novel, and it is to the concept of theme as a means of structural cohesion that we will now turn. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p8.17">Another is water; in the first chapter Stephen plays with the hot and cold taps, and remembers the cold, slimy water in the square ditch. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.17">The aromatic motif of the 'smell of air and rain' (p.13) is repeated much later in the phrase 'fair rainfragrant hair' (p.248), and in the last chapter a cup of tea reminds Stephen of 'the dark turfcoloured water of the bath in Clongowes'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.013"/> The motif links ideas thematically rather than logically, and it closely coincides with the stream of consciousness technique that can be identified in <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.17">Ezra Pound's instruction to 'make it new' led to the emergence of experimental literary forms, a defining feature of modernism. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.17">An example of an organic form to originate from the modernist era is stream of consciousness; a technique that aims to capture the 'incessant shower of innumerable atoms' (thoughts, images or sensations) that are caught by 'an ordinary mind on an ordinary day'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.014"/> The form's emphasis on an interior monologue is related to Freud's theory of psychoanalysis at the time, particularly the concepts of the unconscious mind and free association. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.17">For example, <hi rend="italic">A Portrait</hi> opens in medias res (in Stephen's memory) with the beginning of a nursery story. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p9.17">These sentence fragments cannot be located in a time or place, but are instead connected by their subject (Stephen's father), and succeed in creating a rough sketch of his appearance and relationship to Stephen. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.17">Yet as there is no instruction from an omnipotent narrator to the reader, it is harder to separate Stephen's internal perception from the external action. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p10.17">The absence of a controlling narrator leads us to modernism's preference for showing rather than telling, or in other terms; 'dramatized narration compared with the renarrating Plato called pure <hi rend="italic">diégesis</hi>'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.016"/> Plato and Aristotle contrasted diégesis with <hi rend="italic">mimesis</hi> - eliminating narratorial commentary so that 'readers feel they are being shown the events and the characters, not merely being told about them'.<ref target="BAWE_3066g-ftnote.017"/> Henry James held this as an ideal in modern narratology. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p10.17">In some respects Conrad and Ford do not conform to this ideal, as the reader is constantly aware of the narrator's presence. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p10.17">Conrad uses a layered frame narration and significantly breaks the frame on more than one occasion. </s>
