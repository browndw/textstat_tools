<s n="s3.5;p4.60">In 1897, J.J. Thompson discovered the negatively charged mass now known as the electron, but it was not for another fourteen years that the nucleus was detected and finally the proton and the neutron in the 1930s. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.60">The reason for such a delay in this field is due to the fact that high energies are needed in experimentation to overcome electrostatic and nuclear forces. </s>

<p n="p5.60">

<head rend="bold">The first accelerators</head>
<p n="p6.60">
<s n="s1.3;p6.60">The main requirement for any such apparatus to be deemed an accelerator is that it will increase the energy of the charged particles that are inputted into it. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.60">The most simple method of doing this is by accelerating ions of charge <hi rend="italic">q</hi> through a potential difference <hi rend="italic">V</hi>, and in doing this they gain energy from the electric field to the value of the product <hi rend="italic">Vq</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.60">The particles then emerge from the accelerator with increased kinetic energy ie. with greater velocity, mass or both. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">2.1 Direct Low Voltage Generators </head>
<p n="p7.60">
<s n="s1.2;p7.60">This key principle used in the early particle accelerator designs was simply a method of increasing the potential difference in that system, which would then be used to accelerate ions from a source nearby. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.60">The most basic form of this potential increase came in the form of transformer coils to 'step up' the voltage, which made use of Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Inductance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.60">
<s n="s1.3;p8.60">The second most commonly used circuitry invented for amplifying a potential difference was the 'Voltage Multiplier'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.60">Scientists Cockcroft and Walton made this design famous in 1932 using a fourfold voltage multiplying circuit to accelerate protons to 0.7MeV<ref target="BAWE_0306d-ftnote.001"/>, as shown in <hi rend="italic">Figure 1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.60">This created the first nuclear reaction by artificial means and the pair were later awarded the Nobel Prize in 1951 for this breakthrough. </s>

<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0306d-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">The electron volt (eV) is a commonly used unit of energy at particle level equivalent to Energy in Joules divided by the charge on an electron, e = 1.6=10-19C </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p9.60">
<s n="s1.5;p9.60">The multiplier circuit uses a series of <hi rend="italic">N</hi> capacitors that are charged in parallel and then discharged in series using <hi rend="italic">N</hi> rectifiers (or 'diodes') that act as switches to direct the alternating current. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.60">In <hi rend="italic">Figure 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">N</hi> is shown to equal 4 as in the original layout. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.60">The alternating current and diodes are essential to the amplification, hence it is necessary to explain the voltage increase in terms of 'half cycles' as the current reverses direction. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.60">Each capacitor is gradually charged to <hi rend="italic">Vo</hi> in one half cycle and then shares its charge with the next in the following half cycle, as the switches open and close accordingly to direct the flow of current. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.60">This continues until all capacitors are charged to <hi rend="italic">Vo</hi> and eventually FB will be at +4 <hi rend="italic">Vo</hi> with respect to earth. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.60">
<s n="s1.4;p10.60">These terminals are then connected to an evacuated accelerator tube, which is also connected to ground. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.60">This sets up a voltage difference of 4 <hi rend="italic">Vo</hi>, or generally <hi rend="italic">N</hi> x input voltage, between the top of the tube (where the ions are situated) and the bottom, at earth. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.60">The ions then become accelerated down the tube due to this electric field and are usually aimed a target in the experimental room below. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.60">The high-energy particles are then able to split the nuclei of this target and the products of this reaction can be investigated thoroughly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.60">
<s n="s1.2;p11.60">The protons used in this first reaction were of roughly 0.7MeV. At the time the mega electron-volt was highly celebrated but is over a million times smaller than some typical energies achieved today. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.60">At this early period it was only possible for us to experiment with large atoms due to the fact that this energy was so small, it could not overcome nuclear repulsions of smaller atoms, and so we searched for higher energies. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">The Van der Graaff Generator</head>
<p n="p12.60">
<s n="s1.2;p12.60">Also in the 1930s emerged a direct low voltage generator using a completely different idea and giving a greater yield of energy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.60">The Van der Graaff design uses the principle of transporting charge from a source at earth to a relatively 'high' voltage terminal and set up a potential difference that also will accelerate ions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.60">
<s n="s1.4;p13.60">The charge, from a power pack set at a few tens of kilovolts, is continuously placed onto an insulating belt using 'spray points' which typically consists of a few hundred thin metal wires. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.60">This belt is then run using an electric motor and pulley system, and the charge is removed, using similar spray points, onto the equipotential terminal. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.60">The charge then accumulates on the outside of the terminal creating a field free region inside, but setting up a 'high' potential at the top of the accelerator tube. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.60">This is illustrated in <hi rend="italic">Figure 2</hi>. </s>

</head>
</figure>
<p n="p14.60">
<s n="s1.1;p14.60">As in the Cockcroft-Walton design, this voltage difference between the top of the tube and ground accelerates the ions to higher energies for use in experiments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.60">
<s n="s1.5;p15.60">The Van der Graaff is capable of energies of roughly 7~8MeV, or 12MeV using a double 'tandem' generator with two columns. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.60">It became a very successful voltage source as the steadiness of the motor gave an equally steady and focussed beam of ions that were ideal for experimentation at the MeV scale. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.60">However the main limitation of the Van der Graaff, and of other low voltage generators is the problem of insulation, as these direct generators rely on one large voltage to raise the energy of given ions. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.60">To add to this, the Van der Graaff is also inhibited by its overall size. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.60">As can be seen in the diagram, the equipment needs to be encased in a large steel vessel, containing low-pressure gas to decrease the risk of fire from any sparks. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.60">
<s n="s1.1;p16.60">All these factors must be taken into consideration when designing an accelerator for efficient methods of research, and is one of the main reasons that we moved onto the 'indirect' acceleration approach. </s>

<head rend="bold">3.1 The Linear Accelerator </head>
<p n="p17.60">
<s n="s1.2;p17.60">Instead of using a single large potential difference once, the indirect accelerators use a smaller, more accessible alternating voltage a number of times to accelerate the particle in successive stages and get even higher outputs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.60">The most basic of these indirect designs was the linear accelerator, shown in <hi rend="italic">Figure 3</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p21.60">and we can determine the speeds with which the ions will travel. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.60">
<s n="s1.5;p22.60">The particles will travel at constant velocity through the electrodes as there is no electric field inside them, but each time they traverse a gap between two electrodes they will receive this same <hi rend="italic">Vq</hi> of energy and their velocity is successively increased. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p22.60">This works due to the resonance factor involved. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p22.60">The frequency of the supply voltage is set at an appropriate value to correspond (or resonate) with the time it takes a particle to travel through one electrode. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p22.60">For example in <hi rend="italic">Figure 1</hi> if we imagine a proton enters the first negative electrode at time t <hi rend="sub">1</hi>, but by a later time t <hi rend="sub">2</hi> when the proton has reached the end of this first tube, the R.F. supply has reversed and now this first electrode is positive and the second negative. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p22.60">The proton is both repelled from the first and attracted to the second and gains its energy from the electric field set up in between these two electrodes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.60">
<s n="s1.2;p23.60">Also as the supply frequency is fixed, but the velocity of the particles is greater at each electrode, we must, in turn, increase the length of the drift tubes at later times. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.60">This ensures that the transit time through each tube is also fixed and the particle always arrives at the end of the cylinder at the correct instant for the field to reverse and it to be accelerated once more. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.60">
<s n="s1.4;p24.60">Linear accelerators were not widely used until after World War II, as before this we did not have large enough frequency generators ~ 200MHz to allow this resonance principle to be effective. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.60">After this we began to get compact, focused beams of particles with protons reaching up to 50MeV and electrons up to 20GeV due to their smaller mass. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.60">However this was only achievable for very long accelerators, for example at Stanford National Laboratory the equipment is over 3km in length. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.60">It was this limitation that caused physicists to bend these beams into circular trajectories that used the same principle but took up much less space! </s>

<head rend="bold">The Cyclotron </head>
<p n="p25.60">
<s n="s1.2;p25.60">The cyclotron uses the resonance principle as in the linear accelerator or 'linac' as they are sometimes known, but also makes use of circular orbits to reduce the need for so much space, and hundreds more tonnes of steel. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.60">As with all accelerators, the ions are kept enclosed in evacuated chambers to ensure no reactions occur with surrounding particles. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p26.60">So how do we deviate the particles into a circle? </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.60">The particles we typically accelerate must all be charged in order to be affected by electric fields, so we simply extend this idea to that of magnetic effects as well. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.60">We know from the Lorentz <hi rend="italic">q</hi>(<hi rend="underlined italic">v</hi> x <hi rend="underlined italic">B</hi>) force, that a magnetic field placed perpendicularly to a moving charge will create a centripetal force on that particle perpendicular both to the particle's motion and the direction of the field. </s>
