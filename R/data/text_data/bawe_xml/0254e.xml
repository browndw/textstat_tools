<s n="s1.8;p1.30">In order to develop an understanding of current, voltage, power and power factor in a simple electrical power system, and know well on measurement of torque and mechanical power, the performance of a small three-phase induction motor, we did a laboratory about measurement of induction motor characteristics. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.30">In this laboratory, a three-phase induction motor was connected to an electrically-controlled brake and an electrical speed-measuring device, and a control box showed us speed, torque and mechanical power output. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.30">At first, the motor was running at rated voltage on no-load, then, we increased the load torque in steps of 0.5Nm and repeated the above measurements until the motor was running at its rated output power of 300W, during this step, we recorded the value of torque, speed, mechanical power, current, power factor and electrical power input, after that, continue to increase the load torque in the same way and take measurements as before, stop it when the motor stalled. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.30">In this part, we could achieve a table of data, and calculate the percentage efficiency for each value of load. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.30">Therefore, we were able to plot two graphs (Graph 1 and Graph2). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.30">And the highest efficiency was about 78% from graph 2, the efficiency would be declined rapidly when the motor was overloaded. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.30">Meanwhile, if we clipped the current probe round one of the motor supply leads, and connected it to Ch1 of the oscilloscope, we could get two copies of the transient starting current of the motor from the oscilloscope. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.30">From these two copies, we could calculated the peak starting current of the motor, which was 5.8A, and the time taken to reach operating speed on no-load and full load, which was 100ms and 150ms respectively. </s>

<head>Switch on C and the power switch (a green push-button) on the measuring unit, press 'PAGE' repeatedly to set the unit to display page 4 which shows 'V, L1, L2, L3' (Appendix 1, page 1).</head>
<p n="p7.30"/>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>Connect the variable three-phase outputs L1, L2, L3 and N on the supply panel to L1, L2, L3 and N respectively on the left-hand side of the measuring unit. Switch on B and D, press 'PAGE' to change the measurement display back to page 1. Increase the line-to-line voltage until it reads the rated motor voltage(380V) with in a tolerance of 1%.</head>
<p n="p8.30"/>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>Connect the three terminals L1, L2 and L3 on the right of the measuring unit to U1, V1 and W1 on the motor, then switch on D. The motor starts (Appendix 1, page 1). </head>
<p n="p9.30"/>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>Increase the load torque in steps of 0.5Nm and repeat the above measurements until the motor is running at its rated output power at 300W, then continue to increase the load torque in steps of 0.5Nm and take measurements as before. Continue until the motor stops.</head>
<p n="p10.30"/>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>Switch off D to stop the motor. Clip the current probe round one of the motor supply leads, connect it to Ch1 of the oscilloscope and switch it on. Set the oscilloscope correctly (Appendix 1, page 3). Switch on the motor, apply no-load to the motor while it is running, and a copy of the oscilloscope screen display can be printed when you press 'hardcopy' on the oscilloscope control panel. In the same way, you can get a copy of full load to the motor. Then switch it off.</head>
