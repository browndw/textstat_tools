<s n="s4.9;p27.41">It can be marketed to target various market segments from households to office building. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p27.41">Being part of the renowned P&amp;G group is another strength not to be neglected. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p27.41">It offers specialisation in activities thus improves efficiency. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p27.41">Overheads, selling and administration, R&amp;D and marketing expense are split between departments. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p27.41">The project can be financed internally and is also likely to obtain outside finance on better terms due to P&amp;G's worldwide presence and reputation. </s>

<head rend="bold">Weakness</head>
<p n="p28.41">
<s n="s1.2;p28.41">New product from competitors is expected to come in the market as soon as 1 year after the launch of Powermop. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.41">Therefore it has only less than 1 year to penetrate the market and enjoy the monopoly, within which time much market share has to be gained and secured to combat the early new entrants. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.41">
<s n="s1.2;p29.41">Being the first in the powered cleaning system market, Powermop is competing against many traditional products including its own product Swiffer, which will be expected to sustain at the same level of market share in the non-powered cleaning system market. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.41">It will also have much marketing expense such as introductory offer, outside store promotion to build consumers' awareness for this product and achieve product trust, of which the competitors will enjoy the benefit but avoid the cost. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.41">
<s n="s1.1;p30.41">The NPV of the whole project is not exceptionally high partly due to the high promotional cost (in and out store). </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Opportunity</head>
<p n="p31.41">
<s n="s1.6;p31.41">The product is sold as a kit so there will be much room to boost sales on refill solutions and pads. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p31.41">Development can be made on existing features to enhance the product differentiation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p31.41">Alternatively, patent can be applied to protect market share and prolong monopoly. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p31.41">Taking advantage of the existing presence and distribution network of P&amp;G, the product can be promoted in different regions towards different consumer groups, in order to achieve economies of scale thus improve profitability. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p31.41">At the introductory stage of the product, it can be offered at a discount rate or form part of the promotion of other Flash products to quickly enter the market. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p31.41">Once the product is established customer margins may be cut and lower cost of capital can also be attempted to gain a greater NPV value. </s>

<head rend="bold">Threat</head>
<p n="p32.41">
<s n="s1.7;p32.41">The market has a high degree of rivalry and this product is very likely to attract competitors to enter the market with imitating product as soon as possible. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p32.41">It is essential to maintain the competitive advantage by emphasising on the leading technology and innovation in the market. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p32.41">Despite efforts to defer substitute, it is possible that competitors already have similar product development underway or will be able to catch up very quickly. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p32.41">The consumers could be satisfied with traditional mops and are unwilling to switch. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p32.41">This requires frequent market survey and close monitoring of the market. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p32.41">As the existing product costs just over half of Powermop, it can be perceived as up-market, in which case it is not best marketed under Flash. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p32.41">Other threats include declining economy conditions leading to reducing buyer's power, possible request of increase on customer margins by retailers. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p33.41">A competitor's capabilities and ability to increase capabilities can be analyzed using a SWOT analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.41">However, it is fundamental to predict its likely responses to competitor move, namely its reaction profile (see Appendix 6). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.41">It is essential to determine the reasons for a competitor's reaction or behaviour to learn more about its competitive advantages and vulnerabilities. </s>

<head rend="bold">Possible Competitor Response</head>
<p n="p34.41">
<s n="s1.2;p34.41">According to previous experience competitors are almost certain to retaliate to the launch of Powermop. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p34.41">On the one hand the process of development in new products will be hastened and launching will be planned; on the other hand if the competitor feel confident about its current market position and has the resources to defend it, it might cut price starting a price war or increase marketing expense on existing non-powered mop in an attempt to seize more market share and becomes market leader. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.41">
<s n="s1.1;p35.41">The competitor may also choose either to be passive towards the launch of Powermop and focusing on current market, or react to the new product by developing its own. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.41">
<s n="s1.1;p36.41">Alternatively, the competitor can wait until the product is reasonable accepted by the consumer and a ready market is established, then will they launch a more innovative product based on Powermop but offering more advanced feature. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.41">
