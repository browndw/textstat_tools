<s n="s1.3;p1.73">The program works like it's explain in the coursework 3. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.73">However, some modifications have been added. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.73">The main idea is that, one (or more) server is running one (or more) distant machine and a client which will manage the synchronisation is running on the local machine (the machine where the user is). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.73">
<s n="s1.4;p2.73">The program contains a client side and one (or more) server side. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.73">However, the code is in the same file: <hi rend="italic">dirsync.c</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.73">So, when we want to launch a server (or daemon) on a machine, we have to add an option in the command line which is called <hi rend="italic">'- d'</hi> which means <hi rend="italic">'daemon'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.73">Thus the daemon is running and waits for request from a client. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.73">
<s n="s1.3;p3.73">When we want to launch a client, we have to precise if the source and/or the destination directories are distant. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.73">This is done with the option in the command line <hi rend="italic">'-w'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.73">Four cases are available: </s>

<p n="p4.73">

<formula notation="" id="BAWE_3052c-form.001"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.73">
<s n="s1.1;p5.73">More details about <hi rend="italic">'-w'</hi> option are in the coursework 3 documentation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.73">
<s n="s1.1;p6.73">If the user specifies another case with the option <hi rend="italic"> - w</hi>, he's informed and the program stops. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.73">
<s n="s1.1;p7.73">If the option <hi rend="italic"> - d</hi> is specified, then no other option can be added because it's the daemon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.73">
<s n="s1.1;p8.73">The default port number is <hi rend="italic">1985</hi> for the daemon. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.73">
<s n="s1.5;p9.73">The communication between the client and the server(s) are done with socket. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.73">When the client (the one who manage the synchronisation) needs information about a directory which is distant, it sends a request to the daemon which is running on this distant machine this information. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.73">This request can be something like <hi rend="italic">"send me this information"</hi> or like <hi rend="italic">"do that please"</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.73">So, a list of request is defined. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.73">These requests (instruction) can be, </s>

<formula notation="" id="BAWE_3052c-form.002"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.73">
<s n="s1.4;p11.73">Every instruction has to contain 16 characters exactly (16 is defines by the constant <hi rend="italic">INSTRUCTION_SIZE</hi>). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.73">This is I order to simplify the sending with socket. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.73">So, when an instruction contains less than 16 characters, the char '_' is added at the end. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.73">For example, "<hi rend="italic">openfiledest"</hi> is <hi rend="italic">"openfiledest____"</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.73">
<s n="s1.4;p12.73">The daemon knows what to do according to which instruction is received. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.73">Indeed, each case is treated in the <hi rend="italic">dirSyncDaemon()</hi> function. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.73">When an instruction is received, the daemon and the client know and follow the same protocol. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.73">For example, if the instruction <hi rend="italic">"mkdirectory"</hi> is received, this protocol is followed: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p13.73">
<s n="s1.1;p13.73">The client: sends the size of the path name, then send the path name </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p14.73">
<s n="s1.1;p14.73">The daemon: receives the size of the path name, then receive the path name, afterward the daemon create the directory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.73">
<s n="s1.1;p15.73">So, each time the client needs information (or want the server to do something), an instruction is sent and is treated by the server like above. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.73">
<s n="s1.1;p16.73">So, we have to launch this command in this case: the source is distant (on the 10.10.10.16 machine), the destination is local: </s>

<list type="ordered">
<item>On the 10.10.10.16 machine: <hi rend="italic">./dirsync - d</hi>

<head rend="bold italic">How the modification code has been incorporated in the original code:</head>

</p>
<p n="p18.73">
<s n="s1.6;p18.73">After that, at the beginning of the modification, I have added the code which treat the option <hi rend="italic">'-w'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">'-d'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.73">Then, I followed each instruction contained in the synchronisation process and modify it in order to treat the case where a machine (source and/or destination) is distant. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.73">Each time modified a step in the process; this modification contains a message sending to a daemon. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.73">So, I treated the modification in the client side (message sending) and in the server/daemon side (how treat this instruction). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.73">Every time I need to communicate with a daemon, I have to send an instruction. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.73">So, I wrote a function called <hi rend="italic">SendInstruction()</hi> which will send an instruction to a daemon. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p70.73">I have met a problem concerning the buffer size. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p70.73">Indeed, the buffer size which is actually used is very small (512*2 Byte = 1Kb). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p70.73">The buffer size is used when a file has to be copied from the source to the destination. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p70.73">This file is read and written in several steps; <hi rend="italic">buffer_size</hi> bytes are read/written every step. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p70.73">So more the buffer size is small, more the number of steps needed to copy the file is big. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p70.73">And so, we need more time to copy a file. </s>
</p>
<p n="p71.73">
<s n="s1.3;p71.73">When the program works in local (127.0.0.1), the socket allows a big buffer size. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p71.73">However, when the destination and the source are in two different machines, the buffer size is the source of a problem which I didn't manage to solve. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p71.73">So I have set the buffer size to 512*2, so the program works but is a bit long when a file is big. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p72.73">This coursework contains two different parts. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p72.73">First of all, a main part is to understand how a program works. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p72.73">This part requires an analyse because the program is written by another person and sometimes doesn't contain comments. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p72.73">So, now, I understand why to comment a code is very useful and important especially when the program is open source (hence a lot a people may read the code). </s>

<p n="p73.73">
<s n="s1.3;p73.73">The second main part is to find and write a solution to do the modification. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p73.73">First of all, I had to think about the architecture of the modification. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p73.73">After that, I could write the modification and test it on every step. </s>
