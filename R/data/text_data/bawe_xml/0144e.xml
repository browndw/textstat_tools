<s n="s1.13;p1.17">Max Weber's <hi rend="italic">Protestant Ethic</hi> has been one of the most significant and well publicised disputes of twentieth-century scholarship. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p1.17">The associated literature largely portrays, incorrectly, a monocasual relationship between the development of a Protestant ethic and the emergence of modern capitalism, neglecting the more pluralistic explanation, which Weber himself puts forward. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p1.17">Within the <hi rend="italic">Protestant Ethic,</hi> Weber identifies the separation of the business from the household, book- keeping, science, law, education, citizenship, climate, and biology as factors that influenced, and were influenced by, the spirit of capitalism and consequently modern capitalist culture. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p1.17">For Weber, the formation of the Protestant religion in the sixteenth century preceded the emergence of this spirit. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p1.17">Thus, Weber argues, the emergence of modern capitalism was facilitated by the formation of the Protestant religion, for it encouraged attributes that were conducive to its progress. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p1.17">These developments of religion, which were lacking in the East, help then to explain the economic divergence between Western and Eastern civilisations. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p1.17">Implicitly, given the pessimistic tone in which Weber concludes, the <hi rend="italic">Protestant Ethic</hi> also unveils the dangers of capitalist development. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p1.17">Labour, rather than a religious calling, can develop simply into an economic function as a means in itself. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p1.17">As a result, it is not difficult to conceive how the pursuit of wealth can develop to exploitation. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p1.17">However this was not Weber's primary concern, and this is where his enquiry falls down. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p1.17">It wrestles between Marx's deterministic approach to history, with the all-encompassing nature of capitalism, and the individual and socio-political factors that affect its development and emergence. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p1.17">It is not explicitly an attempt to explain the divergence of Western and Eastern economic development, merely it is the examination of religion's contribution to the emergence of a specifically Western worldly culture. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p1.17">Given Weber's pluralistic approach and his acknowledgement of sociological and historical context, any specific explanations of Eastern development (or apparent lack) need then to be formulated tentatively. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.1;p2.17">Weber argues in a limited sense, 'so far as economic documents permit us to judge', that capitalism and capitalistic enterprises, have existed throughout history.<ref target="BAWE_0144e-ftnote.001"/> By capitalism, Weber refers to the pursuit of profit by means of continuous, rational, capitalistic enterprise.<ref target="BAWE_0144e-ftnote.002"/> Western capitalism, defined by the rational organisation of free labour, was however distinct, and it is the emergence of this rationality that underpins Weber's explanation and development of modern Western culture. </s>

</p>
<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.2;p6.17">Weber places a great emphasis upon the part played by religion, arguing that this, more than anything else, 'created the differences of which we are conscious today', hinting conceivably at the divergence between Western and Eastern civilisations.<ref target="BAWE_0144e-ftnote.010"/> Amintore Fanfani is also in agreement, arguing that capitalism has relations with various religions, 'because these, in seeking to discipline the spiritual powers of man, can, in combination with other social phenomena, destroy it, check it, or stimulate it." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0144e-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s2.2;p6.17">For Weber, business leaders and owners of capital, skilled labourers, and even more the higher technically and commercially trained personnel of modern enterprises, have been overwhelmingly Protestant.<ref target="BAWE_0144e-ftnote.012"/> Minimising the part played by historical circumstance, Weber affirms that economic conditions appear to a large extent as a result of religious affiliation, explored by Weber extensively by the notion of 'calling', itself a product of the Reformation.<ref target="BAWE_0144e-ftnote.013"/> </s>
