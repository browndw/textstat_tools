<s n="s1.5;p1.47">Anthocyanins are pigments present in a large number of plant tissues including flowers, and fruits which give them their red, violet, and blue colour (Macheix et al., 1990). </s>

</p>
<p n="p4.47">
<s n="s1.2;p4.47">Anthocyanidins (Figure 2.1.1) are characterized by having the flavylium (2-phenylbenzopyrylium) cation structure with different hydroxyl and methoxyl substitutions on the B-ring (Kahkonen &amp; Heinonen, 2003; Wu &amp; Prior, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.47">The six common anthocyanidins are pelargonidin, cyaniding, delphinidin, peonidin, petunidin and malvidin. </s>

<p n="p5.47">
<s n="s1.9;p5.47">In plants, anthocyanidins occur as glycosylated forms, anthocyanins. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.47">The most common sugar moieties are glucose, rhamnose, xylose, galactose, arabinose, and fructose. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.47">Both mono- and diglycosides are common. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.47">The sugar moiety can be located on carbons 3, 5, 7, 3, and 5, the 3- and 5-positions being dominant. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.47">With different sugar types attached, the structural diversity greatly increases. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.47">Thus, the structural diversity of anthocyanins present in the diet is considerable. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.47">It will be useful to study thoroughly the actions of the glycosylated compounds as they are the native forms occurring in plants as well as in plant extracts and other products manufactured without hydrolysis. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.47">These sugars can also be acylated by acetic acid which make the anthocyanins more stable (Kahkonen &amp; Heinonen, 2003). </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.47">Anthocyanidins vary in the pattern of hydroxylation and methoxylation, and this variation greatly influences the spectra of individual anthocyanidins (Zhang et al., 2004). </s>

<head rend="bold">Chemical Structure</head>
<p n="p6.47">
<s n="s1.4;p6.47">Anthocyanins exist in different chemical forms according to pH (Figure 2.2.1). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.47">They are present as red flavylium cation at low pH (pH 1-3). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.47">In aqueous media and as the pH is raised to 4-5, hydration reactions generate the colorless carbinol pseudo-base which can further undergo ring opening to the light yellow chalcones. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.47">The flavylium cation can alternatively be transformed to quinonoidal bases through proton transfer reactions and at pH 6-7 be further converted to the blue-purple quinonoid anions (Kahkonen &amp; Heinonen, 2003; Nielsen et al., 2003). </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.47">Anthocyanins are highly unstable in the aglycone form (anthocyanidins), unstable to light and are rapidly destroyed by alkali. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.47">More than 90% of each anthocyanin remained intact up to pH 3.3. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.47">At pH 3.8 a local minimum in stability was detected, and at pH >4.5 the stability rapidly decreased. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.47">Thus anthocyanins exhibit the highest stability as the red flavylium cation. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.47">Degradation is prevented by glycosylation, generally with a glucose at position 3, and esterification with various organic acids (citric and malic acids) and phenolic acids. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.47">In addition, anthocyanins are stabilized by the formation of complexes with other flavonoids (copigmentation) (Nielsen et al., 2003). </s>

<s n="s4.5;p8.47">Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk for these pathologies, and protection has often been attributed to antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene. </s>

<s n="s4.8;p9.47">However, those studies just looked at the benefits of each kind of food. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.47">As different food have different contents of anthocyanins with different structures and thus offer different protective mechanisms to different levels. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.47">It will be very interesting and useful to investigate the health benefits of diet with mixed food. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.47">Anthocyanins are found to involve in a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant (Prior et al., 1998; Chaovanalikit et al., 2004), anti-inflammatory (Wang et al., 1999), anti-carcinogenic activities (Lazzeal. 2004), cardioprotective (Marniemi et al., 2000) and neuroprotective actions. </s>

</p>
<p n="p13.47">
<s n="s1.1;p13.47">The phenolic structure of anthocyanins (Figure 3.1.1) conveys marked antioxidant activity in model systems via donation of electrons or transfer of hydrogen atoms from hydroxyl moieties to free radicals and result in very stable radical products (Prior, 2003). </s>
