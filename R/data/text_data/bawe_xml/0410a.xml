<s n="s4.5;p4.25">Also, it must be pointed out that common law and equity are still held to be separate to this day.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.011"/> Fusion will only affect contributory fault if it becomes a reality, that is the entirety of common law and equity has been amalgamated into one such that contributory negligence directly applies in the context of trusts. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.25">However, given the institutional difference between legal and equitable title in modern trusts,<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.012"/> it is submitted that fusion would have little relevance in our analysis. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p20.25">There are considerable objections concerning contributory negligence and contributory fault in relation to the victim and the beneficiary's conduct must be drawn. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.25">In tort, contributory negligence consists of failure to take care for one's own interests.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.076"/> Contributory negligence will only succeed if the victim's conduct negligently contributed to the losses for which damages are to be awarded.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.077"/> The same should be said for contributory fault for our breach in question, that is the beneficiary's careless conduct directly, and not coincidentally, contributed to her losses. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.25">However, contributory negligence rests on the assumption that the victim's loss was caused by failure to take steps to protect her own interests, or that she relied unreasonably on a statement made by the tortfeasor. <ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.078"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p21.25">The policy underlying the defence of contributory negligence is that 'people should take reasonable care for themselves as well as for others'.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.079"/> In other words, a function of contributory negligence is to make people take care of themselves, which include mitigating their losses flowing from the tortuous conduct of others. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.25">The victim's responsibility for losses resulting from her reactions to the tort, whether acts or omissions is governed by the doctrine of mitigation and the doctrine of intervening causation, such that the victim is expected to take reasonable care for themselves even if this requires positive steps.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.080"/> Conversely, if the beneficiary is entitled to 'single-minded loyalty' <hi rend="italic">and</hi> a duty of care from the trustee, it is difficult to see <hi rend="italic">when</hi> a beneficiary is obliged to take steps to protect her own interests or occasions where she is not entitled to rely on a statement made by the trustee. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.25">While it is unclear whether English courts would accept a duty to mitigate loss on the part of a claimant beneficiary, there are Canadian authorities that have recognized a duty on the part of a claimant beneficiary to mitigate loss caused by a fiduciary breach.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.081"/> Hence, the strength of these objections remain to be seen. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p22.25">However, continuing the logic in the previous section of this paper, if the remedies for tortuous negligence and for our breach in question are essentially similar in substance, then the same sort of analysis in determining appropriate limitations on the two remedies should be applied. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p22.25">This has already been echoed in an argument elsewhere that remoteness criteria for unintentional breach of trustee's duty of care should be the same as those applied in the tort of negligence.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.082"/> Lord Brown-Wilkinson in <hi rend="italic">Target Holdings v Redferns</hi>

<s n="s5.8;p22.25">In particular, a function of contributory negligence in tort law is to act as a mechanism to effect a just allocation of responsibility. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p23.25">Tort-like considerations of contributory negligence should be introduced to trustee liability for breach of their duty of care. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p23.25">A plausible mechanism would be to introduce a rebuttable presumption against apportionment of liability for the careless trustee.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.087"/> However, it is not suggested that apportionment should be taken lightly in the case of a trustee. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p23.25">Contributory negligence is an objective concept that depends on what the reasonable person would have done in the victim's position.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.088"/> Likewise, contributory fault should be an objective concept that turns on what the reasonable person would have done in the beneficiary's position. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p23.25">However, tort law allows leniency in applying the test of reasonableness; some people may take less care for their own interests than it requires people to take care for the interests of others.<ref target="BAWE_0410a-ftnote.089"/> Arguably, similar principles should be adopted in contributory fault for our breach in question. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p23.25">In other words, the defence of contributory fault would still lean towards favouring the beneficiary over the trustee. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p23.25">Only if the trustee could establish gross negligence on the part of the beneficiary that contributed significantly to her own loss, would the trustee be entitled to apportionment. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p23.25">The availability of contributory fault would ease the ethical concern of trustees being liable for losses not attributable to their own carelessness, while maintaining consistency with the fiduciary or moral duties the trustee may be in breach of by virtue of our breach in question. </s>

<p n="p24.25">
<s n="s1.6;p24.25">We highlighted the differences between a trustee's fiduciary duty and a trustee's duty of care and argued that the arguments against introducing contributory negligence into breach of fiduciary duty do not apply to our issue. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.25">We have also taken note of the similar positions a trustee's breach of her duty of care and a tortfeasor is in when compared to breach of fiduciary duty. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.25">We went on to assume that fiduciary duty and a trustee's duty of care are distinct, non-overlapping concepts in order to support the view that trustee's breach of her duty of care is essentially the same as tortuous negligence, and that liability of trustees for breach of their duty of care is based on the principle of fault. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.25">Furthermore, we found considerable similarities between common law damages and equitable compensation and that the compensatory goals of the two remedies are essentially the same. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.25">Bearing the wide range of similarities between tortuous negligence and trustees' breach of their duty of care, we argued that the same sort of analysis in determining appropriate limitations on the two remedies should be applied. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p24.25">We also proposed a plausible model for contributory fault in the context of liability of trustees for breach of their duty of care. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.25">
<s n="s1.2;p25.25">Until an appropriate set of facts comes before the House of Lords, the principles that should be applied in determining apportionment of fault will remain unclear. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.25">However, in light of the above analysis, it is safe to say that there is room for the introduction of contributory negligence on the part of claimants into the realm of liability of trustees for breach of their duty of care. </s>
