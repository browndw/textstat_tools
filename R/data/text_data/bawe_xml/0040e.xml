<s n="s1.7;p1.11">The <hi rend="italic">Annales d'histoire économique et sociale</hi> was launched in 1929 by two colleagues at the University of Strasbourg, Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.11">It was born out of their reaction to outmoded historical thought and methodology in early twentieth century France and its growth led it to be one of the dominant historical schools in the proceeding century. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.11">Thus 'there is no one historical journal that is more influential in the world today'.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.001"/> In 1956, after the death of Lucien Febvre, Fernand Braudel became editor of the renamed <hi rend="italic">Annales: economies, sociétés, civilisations</hi> and thus embodied and directed the school in the mid part of the century. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.11">This essay will to look at continuity and departure through these two periods thematically, and attempt to form a conclusion as to whether the 'Age of Braudel' conserved or contradicted original <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> historiography. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.11">Although Bloch and Febvre differed in emphasis, for example Bloch's commitment to geography was less than Febvre's whose dedication to sociology was greater, they held collective ideals for which the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> is renowned, and can therefore be found in much of their work. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.11">The main source for an insight into Braudel's historical thought is <hi rend="italic">La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen s l'époque de Philippe II,</hi> his doctoral thesis, although some of his other work will also be considered. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.11">Yet it is not only his scholarship that is of interest, for his actions at the helm of the Annales ship go a long way into demonstrating what direction he was taking it, and whether this was consistent with the aims of Bloch and Febvre. </s>

<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.10;p2.11">As stated, the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> was founded partly as a reaction to the focus of French historiography, which was dominated by the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonne</hi>, on political and diplomatic history. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.11">Bloch and Febvre thus wanted to widen such a narrow scope to encompass all aspects of history, especially social and economic.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.002"/> For the analysis of political events in isolation from its surrounding physical and social environment, the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> believed, was sterile, as 'activities are conditioned by time and place'.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.003"/> Braudel's thesis, <hi rend="italic">La Méditerranée</hi>, was originally conceived as a conventional study of the Mediterranean policy of Phillip II. Such a topic was approved of by the history establishment, the professors of the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonne</hi>, because it was 'indifferent to the discoveries of geography, little concerned with the economic and social problems, slightly disdainful towards the achievements of civilisation, religion and also of literature and the arts, the great witnesses of all worthwhile history'.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.004"/> Febvre suggested in 1927 that 'even more than Phillip II, it would be exciting to know about the Mediterranean of the Barbary States'.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.005"/> On this advice Braudel trawled through the archives between 1927 and 1933. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.11">He was confronted with a mass of archival material on princes, finances, armies, land and peasants, used for the traditional history which he was abandoning. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.11">In 1934 Braudel discovered the registers of Ragusa at Dubrovnik containing information on ships, trade goods, insurance rates and business deals; 'for the first time' he 'saw the Mediterranean of the sixteenth century'.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.006"/> Thus Parts I and II of Braudel's thesis are not concerned with the traditional political and diplomatic history of the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonne</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.11">Yet Part III, '<hi rend="italic">Events, Politics and People'</hi>, is essentially such a traditional history, as his thesis was originally conceived, in which he provides brief incisive character sketches and long descriptions of the Battle of Lepanto, siege of Malta and peace negotiations of the 1570s.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.007"/> Nevertheless, Braudel goes out of his way to stress the insignificance of events and the limitations of individual agency. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.11">For example, Braudel attributes two factors for the slowness of Phillip II to act. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.11">First, in terms of Spain's financial exhaustion: 'It is therefore difficult to see by what aberration this exhausted country was to persist in the war in the Mediterranean', of which Braudel asks 'was the Prudent King really responsible?" </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s8.10;p2.11">Second, the physical problems of communication: 'Phillip II had to wait for reports to arrive from very distant places before taking decisions... </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.11">So there can be no doubt: Spain waged an unremitting struggle against the obstacle of distance." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s10.10;p2.11">Braudel thus saw events as merely 'surface disturbances, crests of foam that the tides of history carry on their strong backs' and to understand the past, it is thus necessary to dive beneath these waves.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.010"/> In this sense Braudel clearly followed the rejection that partly led Bloch and Febvre to found the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi>, and thus conserved the initial paradigm. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.11">In rejecting the traditional history of the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonnes</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> sought to promote other types of history, and the foundation of the journal was a bid to lead in the fields of social and economic history.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.011"/> This is reflected in analysing the nature of articles published in the journal between 1929 and 1945: 84 percent concerned social or economic history, compared with 21.9 percent in <hi rend="italic">La Revue Historique</hi>, one of its main rivals.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.012"/> Thus there was a concurrent move away from written sources; for example, Bloch's agrarian history studied population, demography, soil composition, variations in production and monetary fluctuations.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.013"/> Febvre's doctoral thesis, <hi rend="italic">Philippe II</hi> <hi rend="italic">et la Franche-Comté</hi>, was also important as a contribution to social history, not demonstrated in its title. </s>

<s n="s4.10;p5.11">Not only did he bring the <hi rend="italic">Sixième Section</hi> to life, but he helped draft the <hi rend="italic">Longchambon</hi> plan in 1958, which proposed a new university, separate from the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonne</hi>, reserved for the social sciences and founded the <hi rend="italic">Maison des Sciences de l'Homme</hi> in 1963, devoted to interdisciplinary research.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.026"/> Thus he was not only concerned with the state of current historiography, but wanted to preserve at least this aspect of the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> in future generations. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.11">However, in his scholarship Braudel did not utilise the social sciences as his forefathers had. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p5.11">In his <hi rend="italic">Perspective of the World</hi>, Braudel 'remained, in one of his favourite metaphors, a prisoner of his original division of labour with Febvre'. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p5.11">He has little to say on capitalist values, industry, thrift, discipline and enterprise. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p5.11">In this primarily economic work there is a great unwillingness to allow any autonomy to ideas or culture.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.027"/> Yet, Febvre had invited Braudel to write such a material history of France, with the intention of writing a complementary volume on thought and belief, before he died in 1956. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.11">Thus Braudel never intended to concern himself in this study with <hi rend="italic">mentalités</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p5.11">What should be remembered are Braudel's views on the relationship between history and the social sciences: 'He is not worthy of the name historian if he does not juxtapose some of them; cultural and social vistas, cultural and political, social and economic, economic and political'.<ref target="BAWE_0040e-ftnote.028"/> It is therefore evident that although Braudel did not necessarily embrace all of the social sciences in his scholarship, his beliefs as captain of the Annales ship were entirely harmonious with those of Bloch and Febvre, and it is this side that was most important for the development of the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> paradigm in the age of Braudel. </s>
