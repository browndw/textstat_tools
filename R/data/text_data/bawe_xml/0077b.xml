<s n="s1.7;p1.24">The world's first car plant opened in Dearborn, Michigan in 1913. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.24">Henry T. Ford astonished his workers by letting them know that from 14 January 1914 they would not only work fewer hours, but also earn more. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.24">The joint effects of these changes made the hourly wage increase by 138%. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.24">Even though this often is seen as the first proper attempt to realise efficiency wage theory, Ford failed to see a big raise in productivity in subsequent years. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.24">Despite the fact that productivity only increased by around 30-50 %, Ford did in fact enjoy a substantial boost in profits. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.24">In the following I will give a brief introduction to general efficiency wage theories, before more specifically explaining the relationship between real wages and unemployment using the Shapiro-Stiglitz model. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.24">The relation between unemployment and monitoring costs will also be investigated using the same model. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.12;p2.24">Efficiency wage theories first appeared in economics in the 1970s and the 1980s, and make the concept of involuntary unemployment meaningful. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p2.24">These models posit that, in short, firms have the incentive to pay a higher wage than the prevailing market wage rate in order to lower cost per unit of output by increasing labour productivity. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p2.24">Cost per unit of output is defined as real wage cost per unit of output produced. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p2.24">Various arguments are advocated as to explain why work efficiency, or labour productivity, may be positively correlated with the real wage. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p2.24">The nutrition argument might be more relevant for developing countries, as the idea is that workers become stronger, healthier and consequently more productive when wages increase. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p2.24">Others focus on the adverse selection idea, which basically says that the higher the wage, the more skilled and productive the firm's workforce must be expected to be. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p2.24">For obvious reasons high turnover rates is costly to a firm, and if one rather reasonably assumes that a worker's probability to quit are negatively associated with the real wage, it may pay off to have a higher real wage. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p2.24">Nobel Prize Winner George A. Akerlof believes<ref target="BAWE_0077b-ftnote.001"/> that psychological and sociological factors are empirically the most convincing arguments, although these often prove to be the hardest to test. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p2.24">He points out reciprocity, fairness and adherence to group norms as three significant considerations. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p2.24">Reciprocity hypothesizes the simple idea of gift exchange, that workers are willing to exert an effort when given wages above the market clearing rate, while fairness plainly states the idea that people are more loyal and efficient when they receive a wage that is considered fair and equal. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p2.24">The adherence to group norms theory, on the other hand, determine the conceptions workers form about how to reciprocate and what comprises a fair wage. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p2.24">Another aspect of the sociological arguments for paying efficiency wages is the insider-outsider model, which essentially conveys that insiders collude against outsiders to prevent them from being hired at a market clearing wage lower than the wage the insiders are currently receiving. </s>

<s n="s1.17;p3.24">The argument that above market-clearing wages is acting as a disciplinary device is fundamental in the Shapiro-Stiglitz model. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p3.24">The intuitive explanation behind the model is relatively straightforward, however, it is convenient to begin with the assumptions Shapiro and Stiglitz make. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p3.24">They assume that firms have a moral hazard problem, in explicit that workers dislike work effort and that firms cannot monitor effort perfectly or costlessly. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p3.24">Furthermore, both firms and workers are risk neutral, which implies that utility is linear in income. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p3.24">Price is equal to unity, which entails that nominal wage w is the same as real wage (<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0077b-form.001"/>). </s>
<s n="s6.17;p3.24">Workers have perfect information about all job offers and both firms and workers are assumed to be identical. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p3.24">That all workers are identical is a crucial assumption, because this entails that being fired carries no dishonour, meaning that the firm does not conclude that the fired worker is worse than others, only that the previous firm must have paid a too low wage to prevent the worker from shirking. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p3.24">This takes us further on to the main intuition behind the model, which is that paying a wage above the market clearing wage acts as a disciplinary device to prevent workers from shirking and to incur a loss for them by being caught exerting too little effort. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p3.24">This can be explained by looking at a Walrasian market equilibrium, where all workers receive the market clearing wage and there exists no unemployment. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p3.24">If a worker is caught shirking in such a setting, he will automatically be rehired and consequently he pays no penalty for his misconduct. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p3.24">However, to prevent its workers from shirking, firms will pay a higher wage and in this manner incur a penalty for the worker if he is caught shirking. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p3.24">Nevertheless, if it is profitable for one firm to pay higher wages, assuming all firms are identical, it will be beneficial for all firms to do so. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p3.24">Obviously, this will decrease the aggregate demand for labour, and accordingly involuntary unemployment will follow in general equilibrium. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p3.24">By involuntary unemployment I mean "a situation where an unemployed worker is willing to work for less than the wage received by an equally skilled employed worker, yet no job offers are forthcoming"<ref target="BAWE_0077b-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p3.24">Because we now have unemployment this slightly alters the penalty for the worker. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p3.24">With unemployment the worker cannot automatically obtain another job if caught shirking, and this becomes part of the rational decision. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p3.24">I assume that the equilibrium unemployment rate is sufficiently large that it pays to work rather than risking being caught shirking. </s>
