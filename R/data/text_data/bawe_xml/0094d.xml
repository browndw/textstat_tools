<s n="s1.6;p28.30">Surprisingly, it can be agreed that the acts of the European Council are not subject to judicial review in the European Court of Justice.<ref target="BAWE_0094d-ftnote.030"/> The direct implication is that the accountability of the European Council is limited, and therefore, a need for reform arises. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p28.30">That is relevant here because Koen Lenaerts is a judge in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and it is likely that his motive to make the statement is to call for a reform. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p28.30">In support of this view, it has been argued that ECJ judges try to maintain the ECJ's institutional position and "extend the ambit of their jurisprudence".<ref target="BAWE_0094d-ftnote.031"/> This supports the view that the statement under discussion is to an extent political. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p28.30">The ECJ judges are concerned for interferences and the lack of accountability of the European Council, which contributes to democratic deficit. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p28.30">However, the approach taken by Lenaerts et al. is not necessarily right. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p30.30">However, there is no evidence in the Treaties that the European Council could play a formal role in the Community decision-making, which largely justifies the statement under discussion. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p30.30">When making the statement, it is likely Lenaerts et al. were calling for more clarity and reform in the Community decision-making process, but following the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty, it seems that such cohesion cannot be achieved with the present legislation. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p30.30">Again, an argument for reform of the Community decision-making process can be invoked. </s>
