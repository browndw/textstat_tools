<s n="s3.8;p1.21">The enumeration of <hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</hi> has long been established and there are many different methods in which a count of colonies may be obtained. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.21">Traditional methods use a selective medium to isolate and grow the <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> cultures. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.21">The selective medium used for this purpose is Baird Parker (BP) agar. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.21">Baird Parker agar contains components such as lithium chloride which inhibit the growth of many micro-organisms. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.21">The growth of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> is then promoted with components such as pyruvates and glycine which selectively stimulate the growth of the required organism<ref target="BAWE_6085b-endnote.002"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p2.21">
<hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</hi> has long been associated with inadequate personal hygiene in food preparation areas. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.21">This is due to the fact that the <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> is found in the mucous membrane of the nose of a significant proportion of the population. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.21">This means that it can easily be transferred to food by people who touch their nose during food preparation. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.21">With food preparation, however, it should be noted that mucous membrane of the nose is one of the few sources of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.21">It should therefore be possible to practically eliminate this micro-organism from food products if good hand-washing regimes are followed. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.21">In lots of food production companies' staff will be tested regularly for the presence of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> on their hands (particularly under finger nails). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.21">In some cases the absence of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> will results in some sort of bonus at the end of each month. </s>

<p n="p3.21">
<s n="s1.5;p3.21">There are many different sort of <hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus</hi> which will be isolated and grow on the BP agar. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.21">Therefore, to confirm whether <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> has been isolated, a further step is required. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.21">There are many <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> identification techniques made by various companies but most work on an agglutination technique. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.21">For the purpose of this investigation the 'Staphtect plus' technique will be used. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.21">This uses latex which reacts with part of the <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> and causes agglutination to occur. </s>

<p n="p13.21">
<s n="s1.4;p13.21">From the result it can be seen that the sample of ham contained 1.58×10 <hi rend="sup">2</hi> colonies per gram of sample. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.21">It is generally stated that an infective dose is reached when there is a population of greater than 10 <hi rend="sup">5</hi> <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> organisms per gram of food. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.21">The sample of food should therefore pose no risk of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> contamination to anyone who decided to consume it (although coliforms and a total viable count cannot be accounted for from the test performed). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.21">On food samples produced from manufacturers it should be expected that there would be no <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> organisms' present within the sample. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.21">
<s n="s1.6;p14.21">Looking at the results of the 'Staphtect plus' agglutination test it can be seen that none of the samples tested, agglutinated the control. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.21">This means that any agglutination that occurred can be related to the presence of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> (i.e. the test works). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.21">
<hi rend="italic">S.epidermis</hi> was used as a negative control and it can be seen that the test part of this procedure gave a negative result. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.21">This too is as expected as the 'Staphtect plus' test is designed only to give positive results for <hi rend="italic">S.aureus -</hi> it can therefore be assumed that any positive results in the test obtained are <hi rend="italic">S.aureus.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.21">It can be seen from looking at the diagram above that the <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> and suspect positive were the only tests to agglutinate the latex. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.21">It can therefore be determined that the <hi rend="italic">Staphylococcus</hi> isolated from the food sample was <hi rend="italic">S.aureus.</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.21">
<s n="s1.2;p15.21">For an area of further study it could be interesting to try and determine where the <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> that contaminated the ham came from. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.21">This sort of test would probably be done on site of a ham producer and if this was the case it would be interesting to go back and try to determine at what stage the ham was becoming contaminated. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p16.21">With the procedure used; a dilution of 10 <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> and 0.1ml of solution spread on to the plate, it would be possible to enumerate between 300 and 3000 <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> colonies per gram of food sample. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.21">This is because on an ideal plate, between 30 and 300 colonies are needed for a reliable count and 0.1ml (therefore multiply this value by 10 to get value into 1ml). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.21">If higher dilutions were used it would be possible to enumerate the level of <hi rend="italic">S.aureus</hi> to a far greater extent. </s>
