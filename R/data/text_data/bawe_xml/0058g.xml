<s n="s1.13;p1.34">The Bertrand and Cournot competition models both relate to an oligopoly. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p1.34">An oligopoly is a market with relatively few firms but many buyers. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p1.34">It is characterised by each firm recognising their mutual interdependence<ref target="BAWE_0058g-ftnote.001"/> and therefore acting strategically as well as the fact that the goods sold within the market are usually close substitutes<ref target="BAWE_0058g-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p1.34">Under the Cournot model firms behave strategically with respect to the quantity of the good produced whereas under the Bertrand Model the firms compete through prices. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p1.34">When comparing the intensity of Bertrand competition with Cournot competition it is vital to be clear about the meaning of intensity. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p1.34">The most common meaning in this context is how close to perfect competition each model is. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p1.34">The closer to perfect competition, the more intense the competition is. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p1.34">Another way of looking at this is how much tolerance the market gives to inefficient firms. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p1.34">The lower the tolerance to inefficient firms the more intense the competition. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p1.34">Using this definition the Bertrand model, assuming homogeneous goods, can be seen to have significantly more intense competition. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p1.34">Under differentiated products the competition can still be seen to be more intense under Bertrand, however, the Cournot and Bertrand models move much closer together and the difference is not as stark. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p1.34">In addition, there are other ways of measuring competition intensity such as the level of a discount factor required for mutual collusion in an infinitely repeated Bertrand or Cournot game as well as the degree of advertising in each type of market. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p1.34">It is interesting to compare the Cournot and Bertrand models in these circumstances. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p33.34">Advertising can demonstrate how intense the competition in a market is as it is a tool 'to increase sales by expanding total market and attracting customers from competitors' <hi rend="italic">(Nicholson, 1972, p202)</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p33.34">When measuring intensity of competition in this way Bertrand competition is not necessarily more intense than Cournot competition. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p33.34">A market could appear to follow a less intense Cournot model in that it is comparatively passive with regard to pricing policies but could compete rigorously with regard to advertising policies. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p33.34">For example, the car market could be seen to follow a Cournot model as price can be more easily adjusted than production. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p33.34">Quantity is the dominant strategic variable. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p33.34">However, advertising is fierce for instance on both television and radio. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p33.34">This can be compared to the mail order catalogue market which should operate under the Bertrand model as price is the dominant strategic variable. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p33.34">However, in this market advertising is not as strong as within the car market. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p33.34">It is, therefore, perhaps possible for Cournot competition to be more intense than Bertrand competition when measured in this way. </s>

<p n="p34.34">
<s n="s1.9;p34.34">There is much microeconomic theory to support Bertrand competition being more 'intense' than Cournot competition. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p34.34">Under homogeneous products this difference in intensity is stark with Bertrand competition representing a model of perfect competition where inefficient firms simply cannot survive. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p34.34">However, the difference in intensity becomes much less clear when a market for differentiated products is considered. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p34.34">Here the predictions of the models are much closer together and whilst Bertrand still appears to demonstrate the most intense competition, the difference between the two models is certainly not as transparent. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p34.34">We can also look perhaps at different types of competition measures such as the discount factor required for collusion within infinitely repeated Cournot and Bertrand competition or advertising intensity. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p34.34">Here it can be seen that a market operating under Bertrand competition is not necessarily more competitive than a market operating under a Cournot model. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p34.34">We must be very careful of our definition of intensity of competition when discussing this topic. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p34.34">We must also remember that the Bertrand and Cournot models are simply the building blocks of oligopoly theory. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p34.34">In order to discuss intensity of competition further, we could perhaps investigate market concentration ratios to discover if the number of firms entering each type of competitive market differs and how this affects intensity of competition. </s>
