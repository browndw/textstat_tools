<s n="s1.4;p1.14">The aim of this experiment was to determine the HA titre of a virus stock and the HI titre of an antibody stock. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.14">This was done by setting up HA and HI assays using an unknown virus. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.14">The results show that the HA titre of the virus was 3200HA per ml, which gives 1.44x10 <hi rend="sup">10</hi> virions. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.6;p2.14">In order to replicate and produce progeny, a virus needs to gain entry into a host cell. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.14">This is because they cannot generate ATP on their own and need to acquire ATP from the host cell for reproduction. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.14">In the early events of the replication cycle, the virus particle (virion) adsorbs <hi rend="sup">1</hi> onto the host cell and attaches to receptors on the cell surface. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.14">This is known as attachment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.14">Commonly, the receptors on the host cell surface are glycoproteins or glycolipids, and the virus has evolved to bind to these molecules. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.14">The virus does not bind to the whole molecule, but rather domains within the molecule. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.4;p3.14">Some viruses have a property called haemagglutination, where cell surface binding structures on the virion can bind to the surface of red blood cells due to the viral protein called haemagglutinin (HA). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.14">This is a laboratory phenomenon, where the red blood cells create a lattice. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.14">Usually, only viruses which bind to simple carbohydrate motifs on the cell surface have this property. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.14">This phenomenon can be used to determine the HA titre. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.2;p4.14">The HA of the virus can be a primary target of the immune system, so specific antibodies can be raised against it. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.14">This property can be used in the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, where an unknown virus can be identified and the HI titre can be defined. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p10.14">For the controls, no agglutination was expected to be seen, as there was no virus added to the PBS and red blood cells solution. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.14">Therefore, as there was no virus to agglutinate the blood cells, the cells create a pellet at the bottom of the well. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.14">
<s n="s1.3;p11.14">For the first five dilutions of the assay (refer to Appendix 1, table 1), there was sufficient virus to create a lattice of red blood cells, and 100% of the red blood cells were agglutinated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.14">In Well 6, which was a 1/320 dilution, the 50% end point was reached, which gave the last positive haemagglutination: this is where 50% of the red blood cells have virus particles attached to the cell surface, and 50% of the red blood cells do not have red blood cells attached to the cell surface. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.14">This was because the virus was not in sufficient quantity to bind to all of the red blood cells due to the dilution. </s>

<p n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.2;p12.14">For the controls, no agglutination was expected to be seen in samples one to six, as no virus was added to the solution (refer to Appendix 1, table 2 for the materials added), so agglutination could not occur. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.14">Agglutination was expected in samples 7 to 12, as virus was added to the sample, so the virus could bind to specific receptors on the red blood cell surface and create a lattice of red blood cells. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.5;p13.14">Referring to Appendix 1, Table 2, it can be seen that in samples two to four for the X antibody that the red blood cells did not agglutinate and formed a pellet. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.14">This was because the antibody was at a sufficient high concentration to bind to the virus particles. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.14">This prevented the virus binding to the surface of the red blood cells, and so the cells formed a pellet. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.14">In samples 5 to 12, the antibody was not in a sufficient quantity to bind to all of the virus particles, so the virions bound to the red blood cells, causing agglutination. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.14">This was because the antibody had been diluted. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.2;p14.14">For antibody Y, agglutination occurred in all of the samples, as the antibody is not specific for the virus, so the antibody did not bind to the virus. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.14">Therefore, the virus attached to the receptors on the red blood cell surface, causing agglutination. </s>
