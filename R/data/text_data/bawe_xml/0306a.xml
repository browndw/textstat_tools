<p n="p3.94">
<s n="s1.4;p3.94">various pieces of equipment to detect them, and then display the information we require in a suitable manner. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.94">The main piece of apparatus used to for detection will be a sodium iodide (NaI) scintillation counter. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.94">This makes use of one primary feature of gamma rays, known as the photoelectric effect, in order to change the rays into electrical information that we can manipulate with a computer[2]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.94">A multi-channel analyser subsequently stores and processes this information ready for use. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.94">
<s n="s1.5;p4.94">The Scintillation Counter uses a NaI crystal and a photo-multiplier to convert any gamma rays that fall upon the crystal into voltage pulses. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.94">The photoelectric effect states that if a high-energy photon is incident on a certain material, it will eject a photoelectron from the surface of that material with the same energy as the photon that displaced it. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.94">In this case, the gamma ray photon ejects a photoelectron from the NaI crystal, which in turn emits a light photon from the crystal with energy proportional to that of the original gamma ray photon. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.94">These light photons are collected by the photo-multiplier, converted into electrons by the same principle, and are amplified into a voltage pulse. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.94">Therefore, for each gamma ray that strikes the crystal, a charged pulse will appear on the anode of the photo-multiplier, where the voltage of the pulse is proportional to the original energy of the gamma ray[3][6]. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p5.94">The Multi-Channel Pulse Height Analyser takes these voltage pulses and sorts them according to height (voltage) into one of 256 channels. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.94">The pulses are recorded as 'counts' in corresponding channels, and are later calibrated so that each voltage channel represents a given energy. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.94">The information is finally displayed on the computer monitor for extraction. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.94">So if data is recorded for a given time, the number of counts in a certain channel will then denote the number of gamma rays with that specific corresponding energy that have been detected in that time[7]. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.94">One consequence of this type of analyser is that it introduces what is known as a 'dead time' into the calculations. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.94">This is the time that the analyser cannot detect a count, as it is still processessing the previous one. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.94">The monitor therefore displays the real time, the actual time that counts can be detected as the 'live time', and the 'dead time' in which they cannot be, which is simply the live subtracted from the real. </s>

<p n="p6.94">
<s n="s1.2;p6.94">This experiment uses a radioactive isotope of (Cs137) Caesium that emits gamma radiation of only one energy, equal to 662keV. Therefore, if we place the detection apparatus near this source we would expect to see a line from just one channel (that corresponds to this energy value) in which counts have been recorded. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p7.94">As described above, the scintillator uses the photoelectric effect to convert the energy of these incoming gamma rays into photoelectrons and processes these to give a signal, so it is important to remember that the actual spectra will really be an energy spectrum of these electrons that have received energy from the gamma rays. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.94">Therefore, unlike the idealisation shown in <hi rend="italic">Figure 2</hi>, the spectra we record may display many more features due to other physical processes that have caused absorption of these rays. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.94">Some of these features are effects of the second property of gamma rays, in that they undergo Compton scattering. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.94">In reference to the spectrum characteristics, the scattering occurs inside the detector crystal, and hence is a result of the equipment used. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p94.94">Both the Compton energy and the Cross-section as a function of angle were in good agreement with theory within experimental error, but various aspects of geometry could be improved. </s>
