<s n="s1.7;p2.37">A three-phase induction motor was connected to a dynamometer (electrically controlled brake) and a tachometer (electrical speed measuring device). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.37">A control box provided the manual adjustment of the braking torque and displayed the speed, torque, mechanical power, current, power factor and electrical power input. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.37">The load or torque was varied from 0 to a value when the motor stopped running (4.5 N/m). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.37">The consequent data was noted from the display. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.37">Graphs of torque against speed and efficiency against mechanical power were plotted. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.37">Using the data and the graphs, it was concluded that the torque has a non-linear and inverse relationship with the speed of the motor. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.37">The second graph showed the efficiency was directly proportional to the mechanical power and that the efficiency of the motor at the rated load is the maximum efficiency for that motor (69%). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.37">
<s n="s1.2;p3.37">The power factor at no load was found out to be 0.25 and at full load it was 0.84. </s>

</p>
<p n="p4.37">
<s n="s1.2;p4.37">Also, a current probe and oscilloscope were used to get the graphs of current against time for the inductive motor at full load and at no load. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.37">The peak starting current of the motor in both cases was 5 A. It was observed that at full load, the motor took a much longer time to reach the operating speed (200 ms) than when it was at no load (100 ms). </s>

<s n="s1.4;p5.37">A system <hi rend="sup">1</hi> is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.37">An electrical power system comprises of characteristics such as speed, current, voltage, mechanical power, power factor and torque. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.37">These are interrelated i.e. a change in one brings about changes in the rest of the attributes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.37">The purpose of this laboratory was to help understand the relationship between the above characteristics, to analyse the performance of a small three-phase induction motor and measure its torque and mechanical power. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.37">
<s n="s1.5;p6.37">The three-phase induction motor was connected to a dynamometer (an electrically-controlled brake) and a tachometer (an electrical speed measuring device. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.37">Different torque measurements were taken and the corresponding values of measured speed, current, calculated mechanical power and power factor were recorded. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.37">Graphs were plotted to investigate the relationship between the torque and speed of the motor, as well as its efficiency and mechanical power with different loads. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.37">The time taken by the motor to reach its operating speed was observed and compared with varying loads applied to it. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.37">It was deduced that at no load the motor took least time to reach its operating speed from its original speed, while it took a large amount of time to do the same with a large load. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">THEORY</head>
<p n="p7.37">
<s n="s1.2;p7.37">The laboratory was significantly involved with the functioning of the induction motor as well as the concept of power factor. </s>

<hi rend="bold">Alternating current and three-phase induction motor</hi>
<hi rend="sup">2 </hi>
</head>
<p n="p8.37">
<s n="s1.4;p8.37">Alternating current (AC) is an electric current that repeatedly changes polarity from negative to positive and back again. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.37">The most commonly used form of alternating current does so in a sine wave pattern as shown in Fig. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.37">1. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.37">Instead of current as a function of time it shows an alternating voltage, but an alternating current follows the exact trend as a sine wave. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0028a-fig.001">
<head rend="bold">Fig. 1: Alternating current (sine wave) 3</head>
</figure>
<p n="p9.37">
<s n="s1.8;p9.37">Alternating current motors are generally available as single phase or three phase motors. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.37">The currents produced are sinusoidal functions of time, all at the same frequency but with different phases. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.37">In a three-phase system the phases are spaced equally, separated from each other by 120Â°. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.37">The three phase (or polyphase) AC induction motor is used for high-power applications. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.37">This uses the phase differences between the three phases to create a rotating electromagnetic field in the motor. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.37">Through electromagnetic induction the rotating magnetic field induces current to flow in the copper conductors in the rotor, which in turn sets up a counterbalancing magnetic field and this causes the motor to turn in the direction the field is rotating. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.37">This type of motor is known as an <hi rend="italic">induction motor</hi>. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.37">In order for it to operate it must always run slower than the frequency of the power supply feeding it causes the magnetic field in the motor to rotate, otherwise no counterbalancing field is produced in the rotor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.37">
<s n="s1.1;p10.37">AC motor speed primarily depends on the frequency of the AC supply and the amount of slip, or difference in rotation between the rotor and stator fields, determines the torque that the motor produces. </s>

<hi rend="bold">Power factor (()</hi>
<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
</head>
<p n="p11.37">
<s n="s1.2;p11.37">In alternating current power transmission, the power factor is the ratio of power to volt-amperes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.37">In the simplest case, when the voltage and current are both sinusoidal, the power factor () is equal to the cosine of the phase angle between voltage and current. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0028a-fig.002">
<head rend="bold">Fig. 2: Lagging power factor in an induction motor</head>
</figure>
<p n="p12.37">
<s n="s1.4;p12.37">By definition, the power factor is a dimensionless number between -1 and +1. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.37">Instead of positive and negative values, the terms <hi rend="italic">leading</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lagging</hi> are used. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.37">When the load is resistive, the power delivered to it is equal to the product of volts and amperes, so the power factor is unity. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.37">When the load is inductive, such as in the induction motor used in this laboratory, the current lags the applied voltage (as shown in Fig.2), and the power factor is said to be a lagging power factor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.37">
<s n="s1.2;p13.37">A power transmission system is working at its greatest efficiency when the power factor is unity. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.37">When the power factor is less than unity, the transmission losses increase and the system capacity is reduced. </s>
