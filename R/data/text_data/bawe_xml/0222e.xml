<p n="p2.51">
<s n="s1.3;p2.51">Centrica plc is a very large parent company having subsidiaries engaged in the provision of gas, electricity and energy-related products and services, the operation of gas fields and power stations, energy trading, roadside assistance and other motoring services, and the provision of financial services. [1] Its main focus is on energy and home-related services. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.51">It operates from sourcing and securing energy to providing a broad range of distinctive services to homes and businesses. </s>

<p n="p4.51">
<s n="s1.6;p4.51">Broadly speaking, any business on a long term basis is financed either by Equity capital and/or by long term Debt capital. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.51">Equity relates to the funds provided by the company's shareholders whereas long term Debt relates to the loan, bonds and debentures. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.51">Each source of finance has its own cost associated with it and it is important to know the cost of capital in order to make informed financial and investment decisions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.51">Since, businesses are normally financed by a mix of capital; Weighted Average Cost of Capital is a useful method to determine the average cost of capital mix. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.51">"It is a weighted average of the expected after-tax costs of debt and equity capital, in which the weights are the expected proportions of debt and equity financing." [4] It is important for the company shareholders to know the WACC figure as it tells whether the company is investing in projects having returns higher than WACC or not. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.51">The formula for WACC is given as follows [5]: </s>

</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p8.51">
<s n="s1.1;p8.51">(a) Risk Free Rate is taken as 4.5% from 21 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> April 2006, Financial Times, UK. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p9.51">
<s n="s1.1;p9.51">(b) Beta for Centrica PLC is taken as 0.9 from Manual (Index Constituents, Risk Measurement Service). [5] </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p10.51">
<s n="s1.1;p10.51">(c) Market Risk Premium is taken as 4.5% over the period based on the 4% - 6% of equity risk premium bandwidth given by Centrica PLC. [6] </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p11.51">
<s n="s1.1;p11.51">(d) The data is taken from FAME database. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.51">
<s n="s1.3;p12.51">From the above table, it can be seen that WACC increased every year from 7.15 in 2001 to 9.06 in 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.51">This was mainly due to the increase in the cost of debt as the company's long term debt was increasing over the period as compared to the shareholder's funds. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.51">This increasing WACC trend is in line with the WACC trend given in the report of Centrica PLC by Cheuvreux [7] as shown in the graph below: </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0222e-fig.001"/>
<p n="p13.51">
<s n="s1.11;p13.51">WACC is useful while making investment decisions. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p13.51">But also changes in WACC are required to be monitored by shareholders as it might effect their wealth. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p13.51">This effect is similar to the effect of changes in capital structure on shareholders wealth. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p13.51">For shareholders to get the expected return on their investment, the return on invested capital (ROIC) should be at least greater than WACC. If ROIC is less than WACC then shareholder will not get their desired return as cost of debt will be fixed for a period and will have to be paid first from shareholders wealth. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p13.51">Thus, ROIC &lt; WACC will decrease shareholders funds. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p13.51">For Centrica PLC, ROIC is always greater than WACC since the year 1999 which shows shareholders got minimum expected value on their investment. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p13.51">But, as it increased over the period it affected their wealth also. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p13.51">The increase in WACC is due to increase in cost of debt. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p13.51">During 2001 - 2003 period cost of debt was less than cost of equity which implies that the excess return above weighted cost of debt is shareholders wealth. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p13.51">But during this period weighted cost of debt was increasing resulting in relative reduction of the value spread and in turn shareholders wealth. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p13.51">In 2004, cost of equity is approximately equal to cost of debt while in the year 2005 it is less. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.51">
<s n="s1.5;p14.51">Thus, it can be observed that return on shareholders funds is more than the value spread during 2001 - 2003 period but decreasing. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.51">During 2004, it's almost the same while during 2005 return on shareholders funds becomes less than the value spread. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.51">This is due to the change in WACC because of increase in cost of debt. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.51">However, converse would have been true if WACC changed due to weighted change in the cost of equity. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.51">Thus, changes in WACC considerably affect the shareholders wealth. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">4. Free Cash Flow:</head>
<p n="p15.51">
<s n="s1.4;p15.51">'Free Cash Flow' is an important measure to shareholders. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.51">This is the cash that is left over and available to the providers of the capital, after the payment of all cash expenses and operating investment required by the firm. It is a measure of the company's ability to generate cash and can be easily calculated from the company's cash flow statement. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.51">It is basically operating cash flow minus capital expenditure. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.51">An increase in free cash flow is useful for the investors as they can immediate benefit. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.51">
<s n="s1.6;p16.51">Free cash flow can be used as one of the criterions for making investment decisions as it depicts company's financial position. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p16.51">Earnings can also be used as an indicator of the company's performance and position. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p16.51">But earnings can be manipulated and this is tougher in case of free cash flow. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p16.51">Hence, free cash flow is a better measure of company's position. [8] Most businesses fail because they do not forecast their future cash requirements in terms of their current free cash flow. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p16.51">It is the lack of cash flow that leads to the doom of a business. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p16.51">It also gauges a company's financial being. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.51">
<s n="s1.4;p17.51">The significance of free cash flow is that it allows a company to take advantage of all the opportunities that enhance shareholder value. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.51">Without free cash, it is tough to develop new products, pay dividends, expand business by entering into mergers and acquisitions, pay interest on debentures and other forms of loans, etc... [8] Hence, it is an important indicator of company's future growth capability also. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.51">But free cash flow may not always be positive. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.51">A negative free cash flow might indicate heavy investments by the company which may be beneficial in the long-run. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.51">
<s n="s1.3;p18.51">Thus, free cash flow signals a company's financial flexibility. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.51">A rising free cash flow implies a rising share price too as investors would like to invest in companies having more free cash to give as dividends. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.51">Hence, free cash flow is very important while analyzing company's position. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.51">
<s n="s1.1;p19.51">The free cash flow of Centrica PLC for three year period of 2003 - 2005 is calculated using the following formula as shown in the table below: </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.51">
<s n="s1.1;p20.51">Free Cash Flow = (Operating Cash Flow) - (Tax Paid) + (Purchase/Sale of fixed assets) </s>

</table>
<p n="p21.51">
<s n="s1.2;p21.51">As seen from the table, Centrica's free cash flow position in 2005 is weaker than in 2004. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.51">Free cash flow amount decresed from 1527 mill GBP in 2004 to 346 mill GBP in 2005. [3] This decrease in free cash flow is because of the net cash outflow from investing activities due to the following two reasons: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p22.51">
<s n="s1.2;p22.51">(a) Increase in fixed assets by investing in Property, plant and equipment resulting in cash outflow. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.51">In 2005, Centrica acquired gas - fired stations in UK and North America and gas storage resulting in increase in fixed assets from 3169 mill GBP in 2004 to 3670 mil GBP in 2005. [3] </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p23.51">
<s n="s1.2;p23.51">(b) Cash inflow due to disposal of subsidiary was 1404 mill GBP in 2004 as compared to 184 mill GBP in 2005. </s>

</p>
<p n="p24.51">
<s n="s1.3;p24.51">Thus, it can be derived that Centrica's cash position has weaken in 2005 because of the reasons explained above. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.51">This does not mean that the company is declining; in fact the cash has been invested in assets to generate future cash benefits. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p26.51">Even though Centrica expanded in the North American market, the financial benefits were not significant till 2004. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.51">But in the year 2005, it showed 58% increase in Turnover to 3552 million GBP (2004: 2242 million GBP) and 40% increase in Operating Profit to 185 million GBP (2004: 132 million GBP).

<p n="p29.51">
<s n="s1.2;p29.51">Centrica's approach of entering the North American market by way of acquisition is also valid and proper since the acquired companies already have the operational and customer base which makes it easy for Centrica to establish itself and become competitive. </s>

<s n="s5.10;p36.51">The above reasons hold valid for Centrica PLC being taken over as it has strong hold in UK market, good presence in North American market and has established itself in the European market. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p36.51">Hence, Centrica PLC can be considered as a good takeover target for the companies operating in the same or similar industry. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p36.51">The companies that might be interested and have the financial capability to bid for Centrica PLC are Royal Dutch Shell, Gaz de France, Norsk Hydro, E.ON Group, RWE Group, etc. </s>

</p>
<p n="p37.51">
<s n="s1.2;p37.51">This above argument can also be supported by the increase in the share price of Centrica over speculation of its take over. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.51">Centrica shares went up to 8% during a fevered period of trading inspired by the speculation of the Scandinavian energy outfit Norsk Hydro leading as a potential buyer along with Shell and Gaz de France as mentioned in reports by Bloomberg. [10] In fact, Norsk Hydro was negotiating with Centrica on take over issues but the talks later faltered on the reservations of Norwegian government. [10] Also, Dow Jones considers Centrica as an attractive takeover target mainly because UK gas market bottleneck will ease after from 2007. [11] All above confirms Centrica PLC to be a good take over target. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p47.51">Recently, the impact have increased due to the acquisitions of 7 gas - fired power stations in the UK, 2 in North America and a gas storage facility in UK.
