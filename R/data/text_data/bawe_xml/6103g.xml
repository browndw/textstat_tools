<head rend="bold italic">4.1 Pressure-Distance Variation</head>
<p n="p33.48">
<s n="s1.5;p33.48">For laminar flow, the pressure variation across distance along pipe diameter (graph 3.1) the relationship between the head difference and distance is parabolic so that it increases gradually from the walls of the pipe up to the centre of the flow. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.48">For the turbulent flow the profile is flatter, as would be expected. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.48">However, there is a noticeable inconsistency for the laminar profile near the centre of flow. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.48">This is most likely due to human error during experimentation where perhaps the reading of the head on the central manometer block was taken prematurely. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p33.48">Other than that, the experimental results seem to exhibit reasonable outcomes for the flow profiles. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.48">
<s n="s1.9;p34.48">For laminar flow, the shear forces due to the pipe wall are greatest at the boundaries. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p34.48">These forces affect every layer of the flow but gradually reduce towards the centreline of the pipe/flow. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p34.48">Although the layers are slowed down by the retarding force, the volume flow must remain constant by virtue of the principle of continuity. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p34.48">Thus, as the outer layers slow down, the flow near the middle must increase, giving the velocity profile characterising laminar flow (fig. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p34.48">4.1.1). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p34.48">However, the parabolic shape of the laminar flow is also the result of the lower Reynolds number. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p34.48">This can be interpreted as the ratio of the inertial forces over the viscous forces. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p34.48">So that when the viscous forces are dominant (slow flow thus low Re) the fluid particles are in line and moving relative to each other thus there are shear stresses between them. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p34.48">When this happens, adjacent particles have different velocities. </s>

<head rend="bold">Turbulent</head>
</figure>
<p n="p35.48">
<s n="s1.1;p35.48">For the turbulent flow, the velocity profile is flatter since the fluid particles are shoved about and constantly changing position so that their axial velocities do not change much when moving around the cross-section. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">4.2 Velocity-Radius Variation</head>
<p n="p36.48">
<s n="s1.7;p36.48">For the velocity profiles, the velocity of flow varies from zero at the walls to a maximum along the centreline of the pipe. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p36.48">A notable feature for both velocity variations is that the empirical velocity, unlike the theoretical velocity, does not start at zero. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p36.48">In reality this is not possible since the fluid flow is almost stationary at the boundary layer due to the retarding frictional force. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p36.48">This is therefore due to the experimental procedure where measurements did not start precisely at the boundary layer of the pipe but at some nominal point outside, so that there is no corresponding velocity recorded at <formula notation="" id="BAWE_6103g-form.010"/> (i.e. boundaries). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p36.48">This is also evidenced by looking at range for which measurements were taken. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p36.48">It can be seen that this range for laminar flow (20.32 - 3.05 = 17.27mm) is less than the actual diameter range (18.77mm). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p36.48">Therefore it is reasonable to assert that the boundaries were not measured. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.48">
<s n="s1.5;p37.48">Another, more important, feature is that the empirical velocities are generally of a higher magnitude than the theoretical values, for both laminar and turbulent profiles. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p37.48">This is impossible(?) in real flow since <hi rend="italic">umax = 2 um</hi> for laminar flow and <hi rend="italic">umax = 1.22um</hi> for turbulent flow. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p37.48">It can be seen that the corresponding maximum empirical velocities for both flows are beyond their ultimate values. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p37.48">The reasons for the errors in the empirical velocities can be found by referring to the relationship on which these calculations are based. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p37.48">The following equation was used: </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.48">
<s n="s1.1;p38.48">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_6103g-form.011"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.48">
<s n="s1.4;p39.48">It can be seen that according to this relationship the velocity is proportional to the variables <hi rend="italic"> h</hi> and ρ<hi rend="sub">HG.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p39.48">For the mercury manometers, the value for density of 13540 kg m <hi rend="sup">-3</hi> at <hi rend="bold">20°C</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p39.48">Therefore, one possible contributor to the high velocity values calculated is the assumption of the temperature conditions during the experiment. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p39.48">Where a temperature <hi rend="italic">t&lt;</hi>20°C might result in a larger density and vice verse, contributing, however trivially, to the error in the calculated values for velocity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.48">
<s n="s1.5;p40.48">The more important variable is the head difference <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, which is evidently an approximation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p40.48">It can be seen from tables 3.3 and 3.4 that a value for head greater than zero is assumed for the head difference at 9.385mm (i.e. the boundary). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p40.48">This is the reason for <hi rend="italic">v>0</hi> at that point. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p40.48">The same reasoning applies to the rest of the calculated empirical velocity, which are all dependent upon exaggerated values for head difference. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p40.48">Thus, the erroneous empirical values for the variation of velocity with radius boil down to the aforementioned assumption that <hi rend="italic">h ≠ 0</hi> at the boundary (and the ensuing errors), and perhaps also the consequences of starting measurements at a point outside the pipe walls rather than from the actual boundary. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">4.3 Pressure-Drop</head>
<p n="p41.48">
<s n="s1.3;p41.48">Since the fluid is viscous, energy is lost during flow because of friction. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p41.48">This loss of energy manifests itself as a pressure loss between two points. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p41.48">This pressure difference is due to energy lost by the fluid when overcoming shear stress at the walls. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.48">
<s n="s1.5;p42.48">The head difference between two points on the pipe, 15 and 17 at a distance 1524mm apart, were measured for laminar and turbulent flows and the relevant calculations made (see appendix 6.2). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p42.48">The results in table 3.5 show that the empirical values are of a higher magnitude than theoretical values. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p42.48">In this case, none of the equations used are free from error since they both rely on subjective variables. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p42.48">Subjective refers to the fact that in both equations there exist variables that were initially obtained by experimentation, thus both are influenced by human error at some stage and the corresponding errors are carried forward. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p42.48">However, the main factor to account for the difference between the two results for each flow is perhaps the variable <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. this is because the relationship for theoretical pressure difference depends mainly on <hi rend="italic">h</hi> (values for densities are consistent in both equations): </s>

<s n="s1.1;p44.48">As previously explained, observation was used to aid judgement when reading the central manometer for <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, thus <hi rend="italic">human</hi> errors are quite possible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.48">
<s n="s1.3;p45.48">It is also noticeable that the pressure drop along the same distance for turbulent flow is approximately 5x that of the laminar flow (see table 3.5). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p45.48">This is quite a significant difference suggesting that energy losses are dramatically higher for turbulent fluid flows. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p46.48">On the other hand, where the viscous forces (denominator) are relatively great then Re tends to a lower value and therefore laminar flow. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p47.48">The last experiment showed that the turbulent flow resulted in much larger energy losses between the fluid and surface. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p47.48">The implication of this is that shear forces between fluid and surface are proportional to the speed of flow(?). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p47.48">The effects of this in engineering application can perhaps be demonstrated by a turbulent flow of air over an aircraft wing, where there will exist large shear forces when air of <hi rend="italic">Re>4000</hi> is involved. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p47.48">It is obvious that such forces are detrimental to an aircraft wing (would case wear) and it seems impossible to affect the nature (i.e. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p48.48">Finally, this experiment also illustrated how quantities such as mass flow rate and density are measured experimentally and from first principles. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p48.48">In general, the experiment has also demonstrated the need for meticulous experimental technique in order to minimise human errors which seem almost inevitable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p48.48">But as in all experiments, it appears that empirical results will never absolutely equal theoretical results as there are always variables in the real world which are not encompassed in theoretical relationships - theoretical equations are static relationships whereas the real world is dynamic in that conditions are constantly changing. </s>
