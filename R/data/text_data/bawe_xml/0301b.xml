<p n="p1.36">
<s n="s1.3;p1.36">The euro was introduced to the world financial markets in 1999 and launched as a currency in 2002. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.36">It is the official currency for the following twelve European Union member states: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Greece (January 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.36">What impact does it have on trade in the eurozone and is it significant? </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.36">
<s n="s1.4;p2.36">The most obvious reason for expecting significant increases in trade gains from the introduction of a common currency is that this eliminates totally all exchange rates related transaction costs. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.36">Even with fixed exchange rates, there is often a bid-ask spread of around 5 per cent associated with banknote exchanges and other retail transactions (eurocheques, credit cards etc.). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.36">For businesses, this ends any risk of exchange rate volatility and removes the cost of hedging through the use of forward contracts and other derivatives. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.36">In addition, a common currency signals a serious government commitment to long-term integration. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.36">
<s n="s1.6;p3.36">There are other indirect benefits. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.36">Consumers, used to evaluating prices in their own national currency, find it inconvenient and difficult to compare prices in different currencies. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.36">This allows firms to engage in price discrimination between national markets. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.36">The practice of retailers in border areas using approximate 'round' exchange rates, which are several per cent away from the true rates, indicate that this implicit information cost can be quite high. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.36">Hence a common currency removes exchange rate risk, removes conversion fees, and increases market and price transparency. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.36">These should promote intra-European trade. </s>

<head rend="bold">LITERATURE SURVEY </head>
<p n="p4.36">
<s n="s1.4;p4.36">There is a growing literature on the impact of common currency on trade. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.36">See Table 1. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.36">The most widely cited empirical study is Rose (2000), which added a currency union dummy to a gravity model of bilateral trade. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.36">Controlling for variables such as common border, common language, colonial links and memberships in the same Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Rose found that countries with the same currency trade over three times as much with each other as countries with different currencies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.36">
<s n="s1.8;p5.36">Rose and Glick (2001) studied the impact of currency union from 1947-1997, providing country pairs with periods in which they shared currencies and periods in which they did not. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.36">Rose and Glick concluded that adopting currency unions increases bilateral trade by 400% among member countries. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.36">The study also used a model with fixed effects. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.36">The results were that that adopting currency unions double bilateral trade among member countries. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.36">Other studies such as Pakko, R. and Wall, J. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.36">(2001) and Anderson and Wincoop, E. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.36">(2001) also used models with fixed effects. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.36">They similarly found estimates of 69% and 59% that were significant but not as dramatic as using OLS. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.36">
<s n="s1.3;p6.36">In these studies, the sample included very poor and small countries, adopting currencies of richer and larger countries at different time periods. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.36">Also, the time frame of the papers terminated in 1990 (Rose) and 1997 (Rose and Glick), before the launch of the euro in 1999. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.36">The introduction of the Euro presents a golden opportunity to study the effects of joining a currency union on developed countries at the same time period. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p13.36">Note that Belgium and Luxembourg are counted as one entity, following IMF DOTS data. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.36">Out of these, 99 (11*9) country-pairs shared a common currency from 2002 to 2004 and 90 (10*9) country-pairs shared a common currency from 1999 to 2004. </s>

<p n="p15.36">
<s n="s1.6;p15.36">The results are reported in the Appendix: Table 5. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.36">All coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.36">As expected, the coefficients B <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and B <hi rend="sub">2</hi> are positive for both the Developed and European samples. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.36">This is economically reasonable because higher GDP should increase trade. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.36">A high level of income in the exporting country indicates a high level of production, which increases the availability of goods for exports. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p15.36">A high level of income in the importing country suggests higher imports. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.36">
<s n="s1.4;p16.36">Economic theory on the effect of population is ambiguous because it depends on whether the country exports less when its population is big (absorption effect) or whether a more populous country exports more than a small country (economics of scale). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.36">The coefficient on the importer's population is unclear as well for the same reasons. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.36">The coefficients B <hi rend="sub">3</hi> and B <hi rend="sub">4</hi> are large and negative in both samples. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.36">This proves that for developed and richer countries the exporter's population has a positive absorption effect and that bigger countries import more than smaller countries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.36">
<s n="s1.4;p17.36">The European Union is a regional bloc whose agreement encompasses more activities (customs union, free travel etc.) beyond that of a free trade area. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.36">In recognition of this deeper agreement, the models separate free trade agreement dummy variables into European Community Dummy (EC) and Free Trade Agreement (FTA). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.36">Both the dummy coefficients are positive. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.36">Elimination of trade tariffs, quotas, and other preferences on goods lower trade barriers and serve to improve bilateral trade. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.36">
<s n="s1.2;p18.36">The coefficients on EMU B <hi rend="sub">7</hi> are 0.126 and 0.146 for the Developed and European Samples respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.36">The European Economic and Monetary Union has a notable effect on trade, <hi rend="bold">boosting bilateral trade among EMU country-pairs by at least 12%</hi> (e <hi rend="sup">0.126</hi>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.36">
<s n="s1.5;p19.36">While these results are significantly less than previous estimates by Rose (2002) and Rose and Glick (2003), they are nevertheless remarkable considering that the countries in the samples are all developed countries that already trade a great deal with each other. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.36">In the European context, this is further highlighted by the fact that the European Economic Area (EEA) came into being on January 1994 allowing EFTA countries to participate in the European Single Market. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.36">A single market is a custom union with common policies on product regulation, and freedom of movement of all the four factors of production (goods, services, capital and labour). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.36">All the countries in the European sample are members of the EEA with the exception of Switzerland who is still linked to the European Union by Swiss-EU bilateral agreements. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.36">This suggests that even within a custom union, a common market, the introduction of a common currency still benefits intra-EMU trade. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.36">
<s n="s1.6;p20.36">The major problem with the fixed effects model is that it does not allow us to track the evolution of the EMU coefficient over the more significant time periods. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p20.36">The fixing of euro exchange rates in 1999 removes exchange rate volatility. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.36">This should improve bilateral trade among EMU members. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.36">However, as long as there are national currencies, some exchange-rate conversion and information costs will continue to exist. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.36">Therefore only in 2002, with the launch of the euro, will intra-EMU trade truly reap all benefits of a common currency. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p35.36">It is based on Panel data with the annual bilateral trade values of 25 developed countries from 1980 to 2004. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p35.36">In the Difference-in-Difference Model, it is estimated that adopting the euro will increase bilateral trade by at least 12%. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p35.36">The Year-by-Year Model says that intra-EMU trade increased by around 9% after introducing the euro. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p35.36">These results are much lower than previous estimates made by studies Rose (2000), Rose and van Wincoop (2001) and Rose and Glick (2002). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p35.36">Nevertheless, taking into consideration that these developed countries already trade a great deal with each other, the increase of bilateral trade caused by the adoption of the euro is significant and economically important, </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.36">
<s n="s1.8;p36.36">As hinted by the analysis, the major problem with the Year-by-Year Model is that it allows coefficients and other variables that are not controlled for to vary over time such as the early 2000s recession. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p36.36">Hence the results and analysis obtained from the Difference-in-Difference model using panel data with fixed effects to capture these unobserved variables are more accurate. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p36.36">Furthermore, since the data obtained are only for the first 5 years since euro has been introduced, it is likely that there are some adverse transitional effects. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p36.36">Hence, it is possible that the models underestimate the true effects on trade. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p36.36">In addition, several infrastructure variables (length of motorway and stock of public capital) could be introduced to more accurately model transport cost, instead of the more traditional distance. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p36.36">Exchange rate volatility could also be added to improve the predictive ability of the models. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p36.36">Another problem is that it is difficult to establish causality here. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p36.36">It is also highly possible that the increase in bilateral trade could be nudging countries towards economic integration. </s>
