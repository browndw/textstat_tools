<s n="s1.5;p1.47">Sheepdrove Organic Farm, is well recognised throughout the organic food sector, as supplying a diverse range of high quality organic meats to its customers, by various means. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.47">Sheepdrove is a mixed organic farm, situated in the Berkshire Downs, covering 910ha of relatively shallow and nutrient-free chalk soils. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.47">Due to the farm being of an organic status, the 'reliance of external inputs, whether chemical or organic, is reduced as far as possible' (Lampkin et al 2004). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.47">In order to retain the productivity of the land, (as commonly practiced on organic farms) a rotation between clover-rich grazing leys, cereals, field beans and herbs, is practiced. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.47">Into this rotation, and the permanent pasture, livestock graze. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.47">
<s n="s1.4;p2.47">Sheep are one of the five livestock enterprises on the farm, and unlike the beef, pigs and chicken, may be considered as a seasonable meat. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.47">In the last fifty years, lamb has been the only sheep meat eaten in the UK (Mutton Renaissance), and with this being in season for only a limited period of the year, many sheep farmers depend entirely upon lamb sales for income. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.47">However, Sheepdrove has succeeded in marketing lamb, and sheep meat as a year round product, and by doing so has opened up a number of niche markets, including that for mutton, and ram lamb meat. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.47">In order to understand the availability of sheep meat year round, it is essential to understand the production system(s) in place on the farm. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Production Systems</head>
<p n="p3.47">
<s n="s1.2;p3.47">Despite being an organic farm, Sheepdrove still retains the main characteristics of any lowland sheep farm, which generally involve, combining 'the various elements of the production system in order to sell lambs at a price greater than their cost of production' (Croston et al 1994). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.47">As with other lowland farms, Sheepdrove; </s>

</p>
<p n="p7.47">
<s n="s1.3;p7.47">Currently, 35 lambs per week are slaughtered, with the first batch of new season lamb being slaughtered in mid-March. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.47">Lamb continues to be sold through the rest of the year, and mutton is available from September till mid-April. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.47">The main reason behind this ability to sell sheep meat year round, is due to the different systems of production on the farm, and the revival of mutton. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.47">
<s n="s1.1;p8.47">These different production systems are: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Early lambing system,</item>
<item>Spring lambing,</item>
<item>And the methods that lambs are finished, dependant upon whether they are from the early, or spring lambing flocks. </item>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">The Early Lambing Flock</head>
<p n="p9.47">
<s n="s1.4;p9.47">The early lambing system is designed to achieve the best margin out of the early-season premium prices for spring lamb. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.47">Ewes are mated between September and early October, with the aim of 600 ewes lambing in February. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.47">Lambs are sold from mid-March onwards. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.47">Even with a premium being charged for the lamb due to its organic status, a much higher profit can be generated by selling lambs at this earlier date. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.47">
<s n="s1.2;p10.47">However, ovulation of ewes in September and October, is much lower than that of the later lambing flock, a problem that can be difficult to overcome. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.47">The use of breeding, is as essential tool in overcoming this issue. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head>
<hi rend="underlined">Breeding</hi> - </head>
<p n="p11.47">
<s n="s1.7;p11.47">It is generally considered, that the ideal ewe will be, 'relatively small, with good milking potential, which can be crossed with a much larger, meat-producing breed, to produce several offspring that grow fast and economically' (Boden 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.47">To fulfil this aim, Sheepdrove have chosen the Shetland ewe as the nucleus of the flock. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.47">Shetlands are a more hardy breed than traditional mule crosses commonly seen on lowland farms, and 'the Shetland ewe is capable of spectacular results when given the opportunity of better pastures and a higher feeding level' (NSA 1989). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.47">Both pure-bred Shetlands, and Shetland cross ewes are used for both the early and spring lambing periods. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.47">Of the Shetland crosses, a number of ewes are Shetland x Poll Dorset. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.47">Poll Dorset ewes have the ability to breed at almost any season of the year (NSA 1989). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.47">The benefits of the Shetland, crossed with the benefits of the Poll Dorset, produce a ewe capable of conceiving successfully at an early time, and produce a fat lamb within a relatively short period. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.47">
<s n="s1.1;p12.47">The early lambing ewe flock are put to the following rams, for the following reasons: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.47">
<s n="s1.1;p13.47">Hampshire Down - 'Hampshires are widely acknowledged as the sire that produces the fastest growing and earliest maturing cross bred lamb' (NSA 1989). </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.47">
<s n="s1.1;p14.47">Suffolk - Crossed lambs mature early at a good weight, with a high percentage of lean meat and little wasteage. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.47">
<s n="s1.1;p15.47">Texel - An ideal terminal sire, producing most significantly a good male lamb (suitable for selling as ram lamb, later in the season). </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.47">
<s n="s1.1;p16.47">Charollais - Easy lambing, good conformation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.47">
<s n="s1.2;p17.47">Various terminal sires are used, because each breed produces lambs that mature and lay fat down at different weights. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.47">The use of lambs with differing growth patterns enables the constant supply of fat lambs, easily spread throughout the year. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.47">
<s n="s1.3;p18.47">The number of lambs per ewe, are in actual fact lower than would be expected of an organic lowland farm. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.47">Table 1 shows the number of lambs born per ewe. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.47">From this we can see that the early lambing flock, is in fact less productive than the UK average. </s>

</table>
<p n="p19.47">
<s n="s1.2;p19.47">Prolific ewes, such as the Lleyn, and some of the traditional mule crosses, are favoured on some lowland farms for their ability to produce two or more lambs, with as suggested above. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.47">However, at Sheepdrove, they do not aim to have any triplets, and where possible avoid supplementing the ewe (associated costs). </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.47">
<s n="s1.2;p20.47">Ewes are scanned at 80 days of pregnancy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.47">If ewes in the early mating flock, are not in lamb, they will be recycled into the later lambing flock, and culled if they then appear to be barren. </s>

<div2>
<head>Housing and Feeding</head>
<p n="p21.47">
<s n="s1.4;p21.47">The early lambing flock, are housed in January, to allow ewes to settle and avoid stress prior to lambing. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.47">The ewes are fed grass silage, and oats. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.47">It is common practice on sheep farms, for ewes to split according to the number of lambs that they are carrying. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.47">Here however, ewes are split according to their condition, to enable their diet to reflect this. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.47">
<s n="s1.3;p22.47">Lambs are not tail docked or castrated, because Sheepdrove believe that they do not need to, not because there are any organic rules saying that they cannot. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.47">This is understandable where leaving ram lambs entire is concerned, as ram lamb meat is a speciality product. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.47">However, not tail docking can increase the incidence of fly strike, an issue that is dealt with with the ewes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.47">
<s n="s1.2;p23.47">Ewes and lambs from the early flock, are turned out at two weeks old. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.47">This protects lambs from adverse weather, but makes them more susceptible to a large number of diseases and infections. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.47">
<s n="s1.3;p24.47">Lambs from the early flock, are finished early, with the intention of gaining the premium. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.47">The lambs are reared on grass, with a feed supplement of forage (including turnips and kale) speeding the liveweight gain. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.47">Lambs are slaughtered at 38kg, a larger size than the UK average of 16-22kg (Croston et al 1994). </s>
