<head rend="bold italic">Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.51">
<s n="s1.4;p1.51">Max Weber is one of the greatest thinkers and precursors of our age for his complete examination and diagnosis of modernity, the modern life, and the modern personality shaped and invoked in this new epoch. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.51">However, Weber would decline any attempt to categorize him as a philosopher. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.51">He labeled his works humbly and self-consciously under the name of sociology and national economy and advocated specialization in one's own vocation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.51">Weber has left us with voluminous works covering various spheres of human life, but most of them remained fragmented and seemed to be lack of clear consistency with each other. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.51">
<s n="s1.3;p2.51">In his essays of methodology, Weber emphasizes the distinction between empirical knowledge observation and value judgment, and adheres to the principle of "value neutrality" in social science, which invites many critiques. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.51">Weber is thus often called as "a nihilist, a relativist, and a decisionist". </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.51">(Schluchter, 1979: 59) These critiques are reasonable to some extent, but they have all ignored the background in which modern science is located: the disenchantment and rationalization of the world, which serve to be the central theme of Weber's whole works. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.51">
<s n="s1.4;p3.51">This essay attempts to explore the interconnection of Weber's methodology and his religious studies. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.51">In doing this, we can find a clue to the understanding of "value-neutrality" in the context of disenchantment of the world. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.51">The first section will draw on three essays on methodology, <hi rend="italic">Value-judgment in Social Science</hi>, <hi rend="italic">"Objectivity" in Social Science and Social Policy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Science as a Vocation</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.51">The critique of Leo Strauss will also be included and examined. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.51">
<s n="s1.3;p4.51">The next section will return to Weber's religions study to explore the dialectical relation between religion and science through a brief account of Weber's historical and comparative research of world religions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.51">I will show that Weber's religious study is central and consistent with his methodology. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.51">In other words, a dimension of religion needs to be considered to better understand the condition under which Weber develops his theory of value neutrality and science of culture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.51">
<s n="s1.3;p5.51">In the third section, I will compare and contrast Kant and Weber in order to point out Weber's idea does not come from nowhere. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.51">He is the last man of Enlightenment, standing at the end of the great tradition. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.51">He does not merely mourn the passing away of the old God, but provides the remedy to the culture crisis in his own way. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.51">
<s n="s1.7;p6.51">"What should we do? </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.51">How should we live?" </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.51">These Tolstoyian questions are then addressed in the final section. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.51">In this disenchanted world, how should we adapt our life? </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.51">What kind of person we are going to be? </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.51">By answering these questions, I will argue that Weber is not a nihilist. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.51">His whole works, instead, set out to deal with and overcome the paradox of modernity and to rebuild science on "objective" bases. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold italic">Value Neutrality and Objectivity</head>
<p n="p7.51">
<s n="s1.1;p7.51">Value-judgment is defined as "the 'practical' evaluations of a phenomenon which is capable of being influenced by our actions as worthy of either condemnation or approved", "whether based on ethical standards, cultural ideals or some other kind of 'world view'" (Weber, 1978: 69) </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.51">
<s n="s1.4;p8.51">In <hi rend="italic">Value-judgment in Social Science</hi>, Weber criticizes von Schomoller's "admission of value-judgments into teaching," though he could "perfectly well understand this, as an echo of a great age which he and his friends helped to create." </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.51">(1978: 71) Weber argues that teachers should resist the temptation of being "professional prophecy" (1978: 72) to preach their personal value judgments in the lectures. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.51">Likewise, university should not be "a priests' seminary" either. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.51">(1978: 74) </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.51">
<s n="s1.3;p9.51">Weber insists upon the clear-cut distinction between logically demonstrable or empirically observable fact and practical value-judgment (1978: 70), which means in practice "all that an empirical discipline with the means at its disposal can show is (i) the unavoidable means; (ii) the unavoidable side-effects; (iii) the resulting conflict of several possible value-judgments with each other in their practical consequences." </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.51">(1978: 85) Neither could normative rules be grounded in the observation data of human life, nor could we foresee the human history or destiny from the moral laws. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.51">Descriptive and normative knowledge belong to distinct spheres of human life and thus they need to be kept separated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.51">
<s n="s1.4;p10.51">In <hi rend="italic">"Objectivity" in Social Science and Social Policy</hi>, Weber has restated the restricted realm of science as the "analytical ordering of empirical reality" (1949: 54). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.51">Here, he assigns another function to science: it can also "judge" value-judgment critically. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.51">"The criticism can of course have only a dialectical character, i.e., it can be no more than a formal logical judgment of historically given value-judgments and ideas, a testing of the ideals according to the postulate of the internal consistency of the desired end." </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.51">(1949: 54) </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.51">
<s n="s1.2;p11.51">What does he mean by the critical judgment of value-judgment? </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.51">It is a new discipline which Weber founded and developed in the name of science of culture, or social science: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"...an empirical science of concrete reality (Wirklichkeitswissenschaft). Our aim is the understanding of the characteristic uniqueness of the reality in which we move. We wish to understand on the one hand the relationships and the cultural significance of individual events in their contemporary manifestations and on the other the causes of their being historically so and not otherwise." (1949: 72)</quote>
<p n="p12.51">
<s n="s1.3;p12.51">Social science, in Weber's definition, is distinct both from natural science and from "those which involved 'absolute' ethics and teleological philosophies of history."(Turner and Factor, 1984: 39) </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.51">On the one side, social science differs from philosophical disciplines, in that the former, as we have discussed above, refrains from any attempt of value-judgment; while the latter, "by means of reasoning the 'meaning' of the value-judgments, and their ultimate structure and consequences from the point of view of meaning: in this way they can assign them their 'place' within the totality of possible 'ultimate' values and mark out their spheres of application from the point of view of meaning. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.51">(Weber, 1978: 85) </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.51">
<s n="s1.6;p13.51">On the other hand, Weber does not have the ambition to "build a social science similar to physics in precision, scope, and utility."(Wrong, 1970: 8) </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.51">The subject matter of social science is social-economic data (Weber, 1949: 63), but these data are not absolute "objective", for they are "conditioned by the orientation of our cognitive needs, as it arises from the specific cultural significance which we attribute to the particular event in a given case." </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.51">(Weber, 1949: 64) In other words, human's cognitive capacity is always inadequate compared to the infinite knowledge of the world. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.51">In dealing with the infinity, natural science confines its attention on the general and repeatable, while social science selects from the infinite only "those which interests us, which are related to human values." </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.51">(Aron, 1970: 77) Social science "involves 'subjective' presuppositions insofar as it concerns itself only with those components of reality which have some relationship, however indirect, to events to which we attach cultural significance". </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.51">(Weber, 1949: 82) </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.51">
<s n="s1.1;p14.51">Therefore, "Objectivity" in the quotation mark, signifies that </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"the objective validity of all empirical knowledge rests exclusively upon the ordering of the given reality according to categories which are subjective in a specific sense, namely, in that they present the presuppositions of our knowledge and are based on the presuppositions of our knowledge and are based on the presuppositions of the value of those truths which empirical knowledge alone is able to give us." (Weber, 1949: 110) </quote>
<p n="p15.51">
<s n="s1.3;p15.51">Instead of "retreating to pure scientificity, social science takes into account the extra-scientific standards within scientific judgment". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.51">It is not the "elimination of guiding 'value ideas' and interest, but their objectivation, so as to provide a basis for us to distance ourselves from them". </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.51">(Löwith, 1993: 53) </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.51">
<s n="s1.3;p16.51">Weber does not stop at the discussion of the relation between cultural significance and objectivity of social science. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.51">He further develops that the concept of culture, as a value-concept (Weber, 1949), is comprised of "different value systems of the world stand in conflict with each other." </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.51">(Weber, 1989: 22) "John Stuart Mill, once said that, simply on the basis of experience, no one would ever arrive at the existence of one God－and, it seems to me, certainly not a God of goodness－but at polytheism."(Weber, 1994: 78) </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.51">
<s n="s1.6;p17.51">Any attempt to achieve scientific "objectivity" by balancing the various value-judgments against each other is bound to fail, as it is a battle between God and Devil. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.51">Weber provides two examples here to shed light on the irreconcilable conflicts: how could we compare a devout Catholic and a freemason on the same level? </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.51">Is it possible to decide "scientifically" between the value of France and Germany? </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.51">The conflicts not only happen between various value-spheres and world views, but also within one particular world view. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.51">Neither of them is more rational or more legitimate than the other. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.51">Weber gives his explanation: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Nowadays, the legitimacy of such value-judgments is no longer defended in the name of an ethically imperative demanding, in a (relatively) unpretentious fashion, that justice be done－a demand which in part really was and in part seemed to be (relatively) simple and above all (relatively) impersonal because it was unambiguously supra-personal, both in the character of its ultimate foundations and in the consequences to be drawn from it. (Weber, 1978, 71)</quote>
<p n="p18.51">
<s n="s1.4;p18.51">"Destiny, certainly not 'science' prevails over these gods and their struggles" (Weber, 1989: 23), because science itself is just one of these world views. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.51">Therefore, science should restrict itself to the following uses in the practical and personal "life": (1) techniques to control the external things and people's behavior through calculation; (2) methods of thoughts and tools; (3) clarity, which makes clear such-and such means in order to carry out one's belief in practice. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.51">(Weber, 1989: 25-6) </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.51">Science should by no means transcend the boundary between value-judgment and logical deduction. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.51">
<s n="s1.3;p19.51">Weber's claim of value neutrality and impossibility of reconciling different value-spheres has invited lots of critiques from his contemporaries and those of our own age. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.51">He is often depicted as (a) value relativist, "values are on a footing of equality of their validity"; (b) value antagonist, values are in conflict with each other"; and (c) value decisionist, since there are no rational bases grounds for making choices, but irrational. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.51">(Lenhardt, 1994: 37) </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.51">
<s n="s1.5;p20.51">Leo Strauss is one of the most important critics of Weber's theory of value. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.51">As a natural right theorist, he argues natural law is the highest moral principle, upon which social and political forms are to be based. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.51">And moral law could be grasped or discovered by the faculty of human reason. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.51">Strauss "terms 'natural right': the right of the wise (the philosophy) to use the highest form of human knowledge (philosophy/science) to discover the natural and superior form of right or good for 'man'". </s>
<s n="s5.5;p20.51">(Gane, 2002: 38) </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.51">
<s n="s1.3;p21.51">Strauss's version of science could be equalized with reason, which is prescriptive and descriptive at the same time, for it is used to confer 'ought' on the basis of what 'is', by nature. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.51">It could never be value-free, "for it is to be employed to establish a 'natural' value-standard according to which values may be ranked", and prevails and transcends all the opposing value positions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.51">(Gane, 2002: 39) </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.51">
<s n="s1.4;p22.51">By contrast, a closed system of general values with a well-ordered hierarchy of values for Weber is impossible. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.51">For Weber, it is not only the issue of value differences, but also of value collision and conflict, which could not be reconciled by any rational or empirical scientific procedure. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.51">(Schluchter, 1981: 16-7) What's more, there is an unbridgeable gap between spheres of cognition and of evaluation. </s>

</p>
<p n="p23.51">
<s n="s1.5;p23.51">The critique of Strauss is reasonable to the extent that he shows Weber's deliberate refusal to establish a substantial basis of value, but he does not ask the questions further: Why does Weber fail to find a secure foundation of value? </s>

<s n="s1.4;p25.51">The relation between religion and science is one of the key themes of the Enlightenment. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.51">One dominant interpretation held by people during the Enlightenment is that the whole human history could be viewed as a progress of science over myth, mystery, magic. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p25.51">Enlightenment applauds science's gaining predominance over the religion, with the latter retreating into the private sphere of people's life. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.51">

<p n="p27.51">
<s n="s1.3;p27.51">As we have mentioned above, Weber's religious studies are not merely for their own sake, but are linked to disenchantment and rationalization of the world. </s>
