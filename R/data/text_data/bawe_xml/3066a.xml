<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.6">
<s n="s1.3;p1.6">Aphra Behn begins this poem by relating the narrator's passion to a stream, through the use of metaphorical language. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.6">The second line creates an image of a fork in the stream as it splits into different, but equal courses. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.6">This appropriately summarises the theme of the poem; the narrator has to decide on a course to take, meaning she has to choose either Damon or Alexis. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.6">
<s n="s1.3;p2.6">In terms of rhyme scheme, the first and third stanzas consist of three rhyming couplets (aabbcc). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.6">This type of rhyme scheme is sometimes referred to as 'metrically accelerated rhyme' - the rhyme words are as close together as possible, speeding up the pace of the poem. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.6">The fast pace suggests a rapid stream of thought as the narrator, or persona, tries to make sense of her complex situation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.6">
<s n="s1.3;p3.6">The rhyme scheme changes to ababcc in the second stanza, and consequently there is a break from rhyming couplets. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.6">This highlights the unexpected sound of 'mourn' at the end of the second line. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.6">The idea of mourning is central to the poem, as it helps relate a sense of longing and sadness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.6">
<s n="s1.8;p4.6">There is a fairly equal balance of perfect and imperfect rhyme throughout the poem, although most of the imperfect rhyme occurs in the last stanza (god / blood and back / take). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.6">These are examples of pararhyme; the vowel sounds differ, but the consonants remain the same (in this case'd' and 'k'). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.6">Typically half or imperfect rhyme creates a disconcerting feel, and this is true for the last stanza. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.6">The increasing sense of tension and frustration is reinforced further by the question mark at the end of the fourth line. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.6">This is apt for the subject of the poem, as there is no satisfying conclusion. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.6">The narrator cannot choose between her two lovers, so the poem ends on a hopeless and resigned note. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.6">Despite the full rhyme in the final lines of the poem (crost / lost), the words simply reinforce each other and heighten the sense of loss and disillusionment. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.6">'Crost' is a form of 'crossed', and in the phrase "all my hopes are crost" it probably meant 'obliterated'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.6">
<s n="s1.4;p5.6">Another instance of full rhyme that is more disturbing than agreeable is 'heart / part' in the first stanza. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.6">Although the words are acoustically similar, they clash in terms of meaning. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.6">In this context the pairing of 'heart' and 'part' suggests something that should be complete, but is in fact separated. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.6">This could be referred to as 'counter-semantic' rhyme, because the connotations of 'part' question those of 'heart'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.6">
<s n="s1.6;p6.6">Generally the poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with the last line of each stanza in iambic pentameter. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.6">Usually the second syllable of each line is emphasised, but there are some exceptions, such as the first line of the third stanza. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.6">In this case the first syllable 'cure' is stressed. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.6">This is a particularly significant point in the poem as it marks a change in tone. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.6">The third stanza begins commanding Cupid to take action. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.6">It signals a break from the more reflective nature of the preceding stanzas and offers the reader some sort of conclusion. </s>
