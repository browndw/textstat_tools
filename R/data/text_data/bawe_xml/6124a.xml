<s n="s1.3;p1.39">The principal contribution of micro morphology analyses are that it enables simultaneous new high-resolution analysis of the microscopic properties of individual sediments and artefactual and bioarchaeological remains, within precise depositional and post depositional contexts in occupation deposits. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p2.39">Furthermore the samples examined will enable study of the use of space in early agricultural and urban sites including Çatalhöyük in Turkey around 7400-6200BC. Çatalhöyük is known as one of the largest and most complex of sociocultural Neolithic settlements. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.39">The sample deposits, which applied to this report, mainly include palaeoecological sequences and landscapes, architectural materials, plant remains and dung, sequences of floors and deposits and ritual contexts(Renfrew and Bahn 2000:236). </s>

<p n="p3.39">
<s n="s1.3;p3.39">These micro-stratigraphic sequences and micro-residues in accumulated occupation deposits contribute to identify the trace of routine practices, microenvironment and aspects of material culture as well as exceptional events and changes through time and across space form its foundation to closure. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p5.39">In Neolithic Near East, planning is often represented. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.39">This evidence largely suggests that there are powerful organisations for sharing and maintaining sociocultural conventions. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.39">Moreover, the traces of ritual features are identified from this micro morphological sample. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.39">This suggests that ritual is playing a significant role in both private and wider sociocultural cohesion in Ancient Near East. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.39">In 1999, to investigate preservation of organic and inorganic remains at the base of the mound, the research project was started. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.39">The main research aim of Çatalhöyük research project is to place the complex architecture and symbolism within its sociocultural and palaeoecological context, as well as investigating its nature of deposit, as well as origins and development. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.39">
<s n="s1.2;p6.39">However, one of the critical considerations in this aim is to establish the spatio-temporal and contextual relationships between the paintings and other features, as well as artefactual and bioarchaeological remains within the settlement and landscape. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.39">The sequence of wall plaster is from the south-eastern corner above hearths. </s>
