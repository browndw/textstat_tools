<s n="s3.5;p16.36">The protein contents found from Lowry assay were different from that of the Bradford assay although same samples were used. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.36">That's why we need triplicate and carry out various protein assays to obtain a fair result. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.36">Actually, cow's milk should contain higher protein content than soya milk because many proteins were lost or denatured during process and treatment of soya milk. </s>

<p n="p17.36">
<s n="s1.3;p17.36">In Lowry assay, folin-phenol reagent binds to the protein and bound reagent is slowly reduced and changes color from yellow to blue. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p27.36">Bradford Assay is a rapid and accurate method and uses about the same amount of protein as the Lowry assay. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p27.36">This method is sensitive to about 20 to 200mg of protein/ml. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p27.36">The assay is based on the observation that the absorbance maximum for an acidic solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 shifts from 465 nm to 595 nm when binding to protein occurs. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p27.36">Both hydrophobic and ionic interactions stabilize the anionic form of the dye, causing a visible color change. </s>
