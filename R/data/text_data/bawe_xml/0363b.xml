<p n="p1.13">
<s n="s1.8;p1.13">The whole world is undergoing what is now an unavoidable change in climate and how and the extent to which this will affect people will range substantially from region to region. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.13">How the water supplies and water-related disease in semi-arid areas such as the grasslands of Africa, North East China, The Mediterranean and parts of Australia will be affected by the changes is investigated in this report. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.13">The water supply in these areas will be diminished by changes in precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture, river flows and groundwater re-charge which occur due to the rising temperature. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.13">Food production will be greatly affected by the unpredictable nature of the weather with changing seasons, high rainfall, floods, and droughts all featuring. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.13">These factors also greatly influence the spread of disease. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.13">Water-borne disease can be brought about either by contamination brought on by flooding or the use of poor quality, contaminated freshwater during a drought. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.13">Flooding and the temperate nature of semi-arid countries will facilitate mosquitoes which aids the spread of malaria, yellow fever and dengue. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.13">Through flooding malaria could be transmitted to areas to dryer areas where it did not figure before as conditions were not favourable to mosquitoes, which creates the risk of a malaria epidemic. </s>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.13">
<s n="s1.6;p2.13">The Earth's climate is a major factor in the way that people across the world live their lives. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.13">Due to man's activities, particularly with respect to carbon pollution, a mean global temperature rise of 2ยบ is now almost a certainty and this will impact hugely on everyone in the world. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.13">Particularly crucial to human survival is how the temperature increase will affect the water supply as fresh water will become scarce. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.13">Semi-arid areas such as the grasslands of Africa, North East China, The Mediterranean and parts of Australia are very susceptible due to their very nature and as these areas cover one-third of the Earth's surface, accommodating 900 million people, it is a very important issue. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.13">Global warming will affect the water supply by altering precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture, river flows and groundwater re-charge which will in turn affect diseases for which water is involved. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.13">Specifically how these will be affected is detailed below. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head>Precipitation</head>
<p n="p3.13">
<s n="s1.13;p3.13">Precipitation is the main cause of variability in water balance over space and time and in semi-arid countries it is generally low already and highly seasonal.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.001"/> The change in climate is predicted, according to simulation studies to reduce precipitation in the African monsoon, reduce precipitation all year round in the Mediterranean and increase rainfall in the Asian monsoon.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.002"/> In all of these areas, the variability of the rainfall is set to increase. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p3.13">Different areas have varying rainy seasons and different levels of rainfall but the people are all well adapted to this and base their agricultural methods upon it. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p3.13">For the success of farming, factors such as the timing of the first rains (when affects when the crops are planted), distribution of the rains within the growing season and the effectiveness of the rains are all very important.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.003"/> However, due to global warming, rainfall will become more erratic and rainy seasons will tend to become shorter and less predictable without trend and this uncertainty will in turn affect crop yields. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p3.13">Drought is another element that people have come to cope with, as in many instances it is predictable and they can therefore work around them, however with the changes in the climate, there will be little or no trend. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p3.13">On the other extreme, due to the erratic nature of the rainfall, there is risk of flooding. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p3.13">Risk of flood damage is particularly great in small settlements in semi-arid regions due to the rarity of extreme rainfall and in a warmer world the frequency of these storms would increase. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p3.13">During extreme rainfall, houses, roads, irrigation systems, and other constructions are destroyed and human settlements in oases are isolated because telecommunication and traffic connections are broken. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p3.13">As settlements have become adapted to the dry conditions, the total numbers of deaths and the total amount of damages caused by drought and other impacts of dry conditions often are smaller than those caused by heavy rainfall. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p3.13">Damages to the water supply caused by flooding can be disastrous; it can damage water treatment works, flood wells, septic tanks and waste disposal areas and sometimes overwhelm treatment systems, contaminating water supplies. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p3.13">In the case of drought, reduced water availability could force people to use polluted water sources in settlements at the same time that reduced flow rates reduce the rate of dilution of water contaminants. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p3.13">The quality of the water supply can also be affected with the growth of algae and other plants being much more prolific in higher temperatures, leaving behind nutrients when they decompose. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p3.13">These changes and unpredictability of the rains will impact on the welfare of the people with increased hunger, tiredness and sickness. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p3.13">Massive impacts will also be felt on natural resource based livelihoods, which are very common, generally in terms of crops dying, less feed for animals, less or poorer quality grass which all compound to have financial implications. </s>

<head>Evaporation and Soil Moisture</head>
<p n="p4.13">
<s n="s1.8;p4.13">Climate change has the potential to affect all aspects of evaporation from the land's surface, which encompasses evaporation from open water, soil, groundwater and water stored on vegetation. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.13">Evaporation will be enhanced by an increase in the land's surface temperature, which combined with a saturated vapour pressure increase will lead to a decrease in soil moisture. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.13">In semi-arid regions, the soil moisture will be decreased to a greater extent than most other areas due to the relative humidity of the lower troposphere decreasing with global warming and the precipitation rate not increasing enough to replenish this.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.004"/> Semi-arid regions lack water in the first place, so scarcity of water becomes an even greater possibility. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.13">The amount of water stored in the soil is of fundamental importance to agriculture and influences the amount of evaporation, groundwater recharge and generation of run off. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.13">The increase in temperature will increase the demands for evaporation and the soil moisture will therefore be reduced for most of the year. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.13">Irrigated water will also be subject to greater evaporative demands, which puts further strain on the water supply. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.13">As the majority of semi-arid regions are surrounded by desert, it is thought that the reduction of soil moisture will result in a worsening of desertification.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.005"/> River flows and other areas of open water will be subjected to heightened evaporation which will decrease their size and could lead to conflicts over water management. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.13">Hydroelectric power plants will be affected as levels in dams in these regions become lower which will impact upon electricity supplies. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p8.13">Major causes of diarrhoea linked to heavy rainfall, flooding and the contamination of water supplies that this can bring are: cholera, cryptosporidium, E.coli infection, giardia, shigella, typhoid and viruses such as hepatitis A.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.009"/> It is therefore very important that handling of sewage is kept from separate from storm water defences that would be used in the event of a flood. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.13">In the other extreme, water scarcity, to which semi-arid regions will be subjected, can necessitate the use of poorer quality sources of freshwater, such as rivers which are often contaminated.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.010"/> Decreases in water supplies could also reduce the water available for drinking and washing, which would lead to increased concentration disease carrying organisms in water supplies through lowering of the efficiency of local sewage systems. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.13">Warming of open water areas, would also create favourable conditions for diseases such as cholera and increase the risk of transmission into surrounding countries. </s>
