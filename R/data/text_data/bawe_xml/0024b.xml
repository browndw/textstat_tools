<s n="s1.9;p1.19">The term 'cultural diversity' can be interpreted in many different ways. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.19">In their manifesto 'Ambitions for the arts', the Arts Council of England state that, 'We will take the broadest interpretation - as meaning the full range and diversity of the culture of this country, but with a particular focus on race and social background." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.9;p1.19">As important as planning an artistic programme which accommodates a full range and diversity of culture appears to be for the arts venues in Britain, ensuring social inclusion is also standard policy for most arts schemes. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.19">On the surface of these schemes, the outlook for the future of the arts and the constant attempt to make arts accessible for everyone looks promising. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.19">The Arts Council manifesto is full of good intentions and such promises as, 'we will adopt a more modern definition of the arts' and 'we will agree that being involved with the arts can have a lasting and transforming effect on many aspects of people's lives.' </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.19">These are fine words indeed, and are reflected on the welcoming home pages and programme brochures of the many performing arts venues in Britain. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.19">There will undoubtedly be sections devoted to 'Education' and 'How to join in' as a member of the community with the services they provide. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.19">It is no surprise that performing arts venues are keen to promote themselves as providers of a positive service to the community, one that provides the finest experience and the best productions and events. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.19">West Midlands Arts, The Regional Arts Board, has identified priorities in theatre and drama, two of which include cultural diversity in theatre, 'by prioritising support for international visiting work which widens cultural horizons of both audiences and artists'<ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.002"/> and social inclusion, 'in particular in priority areas such as Youth and Disabled arts/artists; through support for organisations specialising in learning and the arts; and through the removal of physical and attitudinal impairments to practice, experience and management of theatre'. <ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.19">Let us first create a more detailed definition of the terms social inclusion and cultural diversity before exploring how an arts venue may demonstrate a commitment to each one. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.19">It is obvious that the Arts Council itself is keen to illustrate its own awareness of the importance of these concepts. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.19">Particularly in recent years, in which a review, 'The Arts and Social Exclusion' was published in September 2001, and a seminar, 'The Shared Space - Cultural Diversity and the public domain' was held in February 2002. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.1;p3.19">'There has been growing policy and research interest in the social impact of the arts; more recently the focus of attention has been on the contribution of the arts to neighbourhood renewal and social inclusion.'<ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.4;p4.19">Social inclusion is about people. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.19">It is about everyone feeling part of the local community and playing an active role in making it better. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.19">Social inclusion covers a wide range of issues - from poverty and employment to health and education. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.19">Ultimately though, its purpose is to help in shaping future and the quality of life. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.19">
<s n="s1.7;p5.19">In January 2001, the Arts Council of England commissioned research to explore different methods of social inclusion work occurring in the arts. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.19">Due to a recently increased awareness of the role the arts play in improving the quality of community life, closer attention has been paid to evaluate the impact of the arts by policy makers in Britain, leading to the decision of the Council to invest in the arts in disadvantaged communities and committing itself to measuring the impact of that investment. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.19">The Arts and Social Exclusion review states that research has suggested the role of the arts in supporting community development is vital. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.19">Social inclusion is a catalyst for generating community development. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.19">In seeking its role at the heart of community life, an arts venue must demonstrate a commitment to the concept of social in its artistic programme - not only in the productions it presents but also in the events and services it provides for the public. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.19">Of the many aspects of social inclusion, education often plays a major role in the work of an arts venue. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p5.19">I shall explore this further later on. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.19">
<s n="s1.9;p6.19">The change in national demography and its impact on cultural life, which is one of the major challenges to contemporary cultural policy, was discussed at 'The Shared Space' seminar. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.19">One way of viewing cultural diversity is to focus on the relationship between ethnic minorities and the mainstream. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.19">However, 'The Shared Space' seminar discussed the difference between making more places within the mainstream for diverse populations and changing the working of the mainstream itself. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.19">'The ability to accommodate diversity, in short, was seen as a core item in the health check of every organisation, indicating a broader ability to deal flexibly and creatively with change and to achieve a state of equity in management of the public cultural space." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s5.9;p6.19">Similar to the increased awareness of the importance of social inclusion, the Arts Council's commitment to Cultural diversity progressed promisingly in April 2003 when the final year of their New Audiences programme was launched with a seminar addressing the promotion and development of South Asian Arts and South Asian audiences. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.19">For this essay I have decided to compare and contrast the artistic programmes of the Birmingham Hippodrome and Derby Playhouse. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.19">Each of these is located within a city; meaning greater competition is faced for them from other venues. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.19">Their locations also mean that the Hippodrome and the Playhouse attract audiences from a wide and broadly cultural area, as they are city regional theatres with large theatre-going sectors. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.19">Although the venues are similar in these ways, they are vastly contrasting in others. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.19">Derby Playhouse is a producing theatre. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.19">Nearly all its productions are Derby Playhouse productions, although sometimes in conjunction with another theatre. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.19">As the Derby Assembly Rooms and the Guildhall Theatre - both run by Derby City Council are located within the same audience catchments area, the artistic programme of the Playhouse predominantly consists of play productions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.19">The Birmingham Hippodrome is primarily a non-producing venue although it is in partnership with the Birmingham Royal Ballet and DanceXchange - companies which are based at and perform there. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.19">Its recent multi-million pound development has turned it into 'One of the finest theatre complexes in the world and a majestic combination of tradition and modernity." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.006"/>

<s n="s4.7;p8.19">Ethnic minorities form 21.5% of the population. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.19">It revealed that 21,144 persons belonged to ethnic minorities in Derby, which represents 9.7% of the population. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.19">In demonstrating a commitment to social inclusion, an arts venue must also show an awareness of the accommodation of all minority groups including the disabled, the young and the old. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.19">The Arts Council's 'Ambitions for the arts' highlights their importance, 'We recognise the transforming power of the arts in relation to young people...creative partnerships can bring about profound change in how education relates to the arts and vice versa...we want to see the same principle - putting people and high quality artists and art together to create transforming experiences - applied to other sectors and ages.' <ref target="BAWE_0024b-ftnote.007"/> </s>
