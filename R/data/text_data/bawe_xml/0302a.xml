<s n="s5.11;p3.12">Roosevelt's policy, therefore, did encourage an economic upturn. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p3.12">Though this has been attributed to the failure of Keynesian- style economics, it is more likely that it was the half- hearted nature and lack of commitment to his policies that resulted in the poor result. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p3.12">Keynes argued that intentionally unbalancing the budget would boost demand to the point where recovery would take place. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p3.12">Roosevelt was reluctant to accept any increased deficit spending, however, to prevent mass suffering. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p3.12">Only when the Second World War increased production and forced an unbalanced budget on the scale that Keynes advocated did the depression end. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p3.12">Therefore though Roosevelt did encourage an economic upturn, his policies were too conservative to enable a full- scale economic recovery. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p4.12">Additionally, when higher wages went into effect, prices rose and consumers stopped buying. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.12">In addition to trying to rejuvenate the American economy through businesses and banks, the New Deal intended to resolve various problems in American society, such as unemployment. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.12">When Roosevelt came into office, 25% of all Americans were unemployed with Fortune magazine estimating that 28,000,000 had no income.<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.011"/> Unemployment in 1939 had been reduced to approximately 10% (9,000,000) through such agencies as the Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.12">The latter, for example, provided cheap electric power and flood control as well as recreational opportunities to the entire Tennessee River Valley. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.12">For a leading industrialised nation, however, 10% unemployment is still indicative of a serious depression, suggesting that Roosevelt's "fundamental fiscal conservatism"<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.012"/> rendered the policies less successful than they were portrayed at the time. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.12">Therefore though the New Deal did offer more employment opportunities, it was not until the War that the unemployment problem was completely solved, rendering the success of the New Deal limited in both scope and long term success. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p7.12">Roosevelt's key policy aimed at "countering the deep malaise that American agriculture had fallen into"<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.016"/> was the Agricultural Adjustment Act. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.12">This required farmers to lower their output by destroying crops and animals in order to raise prices and "establish relative balance between agriculture and the rest of the national economy." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s5.7;p7.12">As Leonard J Arrington later noted, "the prime goal would seem to have been the restoration of income for individual farmers rather than the achievement of a greater equality." </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.12">It was a very unpopular policy, condoning the destruction of food when millions of Americans were starving. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p8.12">It has been argued that Roosevelt's policies were particularly successful for black Americans. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p8.12">The decade became one of positive change despite discrimination for job places. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p8.12">Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, was an active champion of black rights, and many New Deal programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps prohibited racial discrimination. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p8.12">This resulted in many blacks switching their support from the Republicans to Roosevelt's Democrats, which has largely continued to today. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p8.12">The economic assistance, however, was far more limited for blacks than for whites, and discrimination was widespread. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p8.12">Blacks lived in substandard barracks whilst working for the TVA, and skilled jobs went first to whites. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p8.12">Blacks were 11% of the work force but only received 9% of the payroll.<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.018"/> Furthermore, many of the policies were administered by the states, giving Southern states' governments enough power to ensure that more Federal aid "went to rural areas than to cities, and to whites rather than blacks." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.019"/>
<s n="s8.11;p8.12">It was however, a start which blacks were grateful for; Charles Matthews, who became one of the first black democratic chairmen in Newark, stated that "discrimination or not, we were participating.... </s>

<s n="s10.11;p8.12">Additionally, it should be noted that the discrimination was directed at whites as well as blacks; poor evicted farmers, for example, were despised and abused, and labelled as 'Okies.' </s>

<s n="s1.11;p9.12">Similar is true of other minorities, such as the Native Americans and women. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p9.12">As regards the former, the New Deal introduced the Indian Reorganization Act which ended the sale of tribal lands and restored ownership of unallocated lands to Native American groups. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p9.12">John Collier also attempted to reform Native American policy by re- establishing tribal self- government. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.12">The political structures that had previously governed them, however, were no longer there. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p9.12">The reform therefore failed, leaving a "new generation of Indians to define themselves." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s6.11;p9.12">Women, on the other hand, were poorly treated by the New Deal at first; the Hundred Days did nothing for the 140,000 homeless women and girls or the 4 million unemployed. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p9.12">Later, however, Eleanor Roosevelt pushed for reforms. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p9.12">Initially, for example, she sponsored a White House Conference on the Emergency Needs of Women, resulting in 300,000 women employed within two months. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p9.12">Discrimination still existed; in the CCC, relief administrators "refused to allow women 'outside' work"<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.022"/> and discrimination in salaries and all benefits continued. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p9.12">Furthermore, employment was slow, sporadic and inadequate; over three million women remained unemployed. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p9.12">Therefore, though the New Deal was unprecedented and an improvement on the preceding era, discrimination was still wide- spread for minority groups and many civil rights issues were not fully addressed. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p10.12">Previously ill-favoured by minorities, the New Deal not only gained their support but also ensured that the Democrat Party was perceived as the natural party of government; as Badger asserts, it "fashioned the Democratic Party into the new national majority party," rendering it successful in following elections. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.12">The New Deal marked the end of laissez- faire policies and increased scope for the executive, with Congress "willingly delegate[ing] vast, unencumbered authority to the president." </s>

<s n="s1.5;p11.12">Further to this, it is often stated that the character of Roosevelt, rather than the actual policies he implemented, created the greatest change in America. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.12">Roosevelt connected with the American people and encouraged optimism through "fireside chats," hundreds of formal speeches, 998 press conferences, and measures that encouraged citizens that something was being done, even if great change was not happening. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.12">The Social Security Act, for example, excluded many sections of the work force such as farm and domestic workers, yet it helped millions of Americans feel more secure. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.12">This was a "remarkable departure for an institution that had previously tended to deal with the public through respectful newsmen, handing written questions to the President's press secretary, to be answered at his convenience." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.025"/>
<s n="s5.5;p11.12">Roosevelt's attitude more than his policies, therefore, counteracted the failure of many aspects of the New Deal and encouraged optimism in the American people which sustained the economy until the onset of the Second World War. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p12.12">The New Deal was not entirely unsuccessful; it set precedents for equal rights among blacks, women, and Native Americans that were previously unheard of, and it did go some way to improving employment and recovering the economy. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p12.12">The impact of such measures, however, should have been much more obvious after almost a decade. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p12.12">Roosevelt's conservatism prevented greater success and encouraged opposition such as the American Liberty League. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p12.12">The New Deal, therefore, can be seen as largely unsuccessful and inconsistent; "expansionist and reductionist; conservative and progressive; deflationary and inflationary. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p12.12">It did not end the Depression, unemployment, or poverty." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.026"/>
<s n="s6.10;p12.12">Due to Roosevelt's optimism, however, business owners, bankers, depositors, homeowners, farmers and ranchers still felt "a new sense of security and action replaced years of anxiety and political torpor." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302a-ftnote.027"/>
<s n="s7.10;p12.12">Roosevelt created previously unimagined changes to the role of the President and the relationship between the three branches of government which have continued to this day. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p12.12">He persuaded many American people that change was being successfully implemented, encouraging them to have optimism in their country and the economy. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p12.12">Therefore though the New Deal may have been unsuccessful, Roosevelt's portrayal of it and his impact on the American people meant that its success was perceived as much greater. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p12.12">This successfully sustained the country until the Second World War started and ended the American Depression. </s>
