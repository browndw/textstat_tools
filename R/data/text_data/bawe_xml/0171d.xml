<s n="s3.5;p7.16">The large range of values, minimum (3600) and maximum (31992) support the view that there are outliers in the upper quartile as well as the values of skewness and kurtosis which indicate that there is a skew to the left and there is a leptokurtic peak. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.16">This means that the majority of values are at the lower end of the range and the distribution is peaked, probably given the skew value, at the lower end of the range. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p8.16">When looking at Beginning Salary in relation to the variable Gender, a large difference (£2883.77) in the beginning mean salary paid between males and females is found. </s>

<p n="p10.16">
<s n="s1.2;p10.16">This would affect the value of the mean salary of males and females, therefore to accurately look at whether there is a pay gap between the male and female employees, an analysis of beginning salary by employment category needs to be performed. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p11.16">It is necessary to see if the same issues arise when looking at the current salary figures. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.16">
<s n="s1.8;p12.16">The mean current salary is £13767.83 and has a median value of £11550.00, this suggests that there are not as many extreme outliers within the current salary as there were within the beginning salary. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.16">This is supported by the standard deviation value, which is almost double that of the beginning salary variable. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.16">A large S.D. value indicates that there are not many outliers, but the values cover a larger range, as seen when the ranges of both variables are compared. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.16">The value of skewness and kurtosis also support the idea that there is a greater range of values within this variable, compared to the beginning salary variable. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.16">The skewness value of the current salary is slightly less than that of the beginning salary this indicates that the current salary distribution does skew to the left, although not to the same extent of the beginning salary distribution. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.16">The kurtosis value indicates that the distribution of current salary is more platykurtic than the distribution of the beginning. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.16">This means that whilst the majority of values are still at the lower end of the distribution, this majority is not as peaked as that of the beginning salary variable. </s>

<p n="p16.16">
<s n="s1.2;p16.16">It has also been seen that employees from minority backgrounds are being paid less than those who are not from a minority background even if they are of the same gender. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.16">Therefore, female employees from a minority background are the lowest paid employees within the company, however due to the limitations of the analysis of the information no firm conclusions can be drawn from this data to explain why this is. </s>
