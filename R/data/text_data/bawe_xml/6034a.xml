<s n="s1.1;p4.34">The aim of this essay is to show, that the third CAP objective of market stabilisation, only partially reflected in the Polish strategic document for agriculture, is still relevant to the situation on the soft fruit market in this country, but cannot be met due to the inadequate policy instruments. </s>
