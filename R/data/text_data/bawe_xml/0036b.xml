<s n="s1.4;p2.32">Since Charles Darwin pioneered the concept of systematic hierarchy representing an approximation of evolutionary history, there are more and more attentions have been paid on phylogenetic systematics, a term for identifying and understanding the evolutionary relationships normally due to a gradual populational phenomenon, among all kinds of living things on earth, both extant and extinct. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.32">In the evolutionary hierarchy, an evolutionary diversity is regarded at many levels from genes, species, to genera and higher taxon. </s>

<hi rend="bold">Figure 8</hi> legend: bootstrap analysis proceeds in three steps. The dataset is randomly sampled with replacement to create multiple pseudo-datasets of the same size as the original (a); (b) individual trees are constructed from each of the pseudo-datasets. (c) Each of the pseudo-dataset trees are scored for which nodes (groupings) appear and how often. In this case, a node uniting seqA plus seqB is found in two of the three replicate trees. This gives a bootstrap support for this grouping of 2/3 or 67%. Figure adapted from Baldauf (2003)</head>

<s n="s1.2;p32.32">At present, difficulties of phylogenetic analysis are mainly come from the reliability of the inference of phylogeny tree due to the resource and the methods, and the limited biological information that phylogenetics is starving for. </s>
