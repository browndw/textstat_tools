<s n="s3.4;p3.38">Ideologies and politics played a major part in the building of increasingly large dams, often without regard for the costs to a nation.<ref target="BAWE_0027c-endnote.001"/> In the later part of the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, many of the benefits of large dams began to be called into question by ever strengthening opposition, with a building case on the negative environmental, economic and social impacts of large dams. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.38">As a result of this, and the saturation of the hydro resource of many countries, there has been a great decline in the number of projects being commissioned. </s>
