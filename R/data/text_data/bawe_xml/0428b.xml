<head rend="underlined bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.53">
<s n="s1.3;p1.53">Since the late 1970s, with the adoption of neo-liberal economic policies by US and UK, the world economy entirely shifted its direction. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.53">Practices such as free trade and deregulation policies became so widespread that they came to be known as "The Washington Consensus". </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.53">Even the end of History, with the final triumph of Capitalism, was heralded. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.53">
<s n="s1.2;p2.53">Hedge Funds, as will see below, are not in any way the product of neo-liberalism. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.53">They were, at least in their most recent form, much fostered by some of its facets, such as deregulation and liberalisation of capital flows, which were much aided by the coming of the Internet. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.53">
<s n="s1.3;p3.53">But globalisation is not without its drawbacks. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.53">At this point, a parallel with taxation may be helpful, for at least some of the challenges Hedge Funds present are similar to those faced by regulators as to tax shopping before the enactment of transfer pricing rules - in that the dilemmas our issue presents can never be efficiently tackled solely from the perspective of a single country, even though regulation is intrinsically a sovereign governmental activity, not easily made compatible with a global strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.53">In addition, the weighing of interest by government authorities in regulating hedge funds is far more convoluted than in taxation - where, at least theoretically, most problems could be solved by delegating all powers to a global authority who had powers apportion public revenue amongst states in much the same way a central government does with sub-national entities, so as to attain to the objective of fiscal neutrality as to investment allocation decisions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.53">
<s n="s1.1;p4.53">Conversely, not only do financial regulators of different countries compete against one another for the scarce liquidity that few economic agents apart from hedge funds can provide, they can do so only if the regulations they enact are neither so loose that they fail to protect against crisis, nor so draconian as to prevent maximisation of returns and discourage funds from doing business within their jurisdiction. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.53">
<s n="s1.3;p5.53">Moreover, unlike taxation, those Highly Leveraged Financial Institutions (HLIs)<ref target="BAWE_0428b-ftnote.001"/> can only deliver nearly-stratospheric yields if they are allowed to exploit to the fullest, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, discrepancies in time and is space that are entailed by the pursuit of diverse national economic policies, in a practice known as arbitrage<ref target="BAWE_0428b-ftnote.002"/> in the jargon of the financial markets. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.53">To our imaginary Earth Revenue, tax havens would simply be banned. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.53">Conversely, hedge funds cannot do without them - as most their most common corporate structures rely on a tax-haven based parent company so as to benefit from lower disclosure requirements and tax rates. </s>

</note>
<p n="p6.53">
<s n="s1.1;p6.53">If taxation is the antithesis of globalisation - in that it depends on what divides countries - national sovereign powers _, instead of what unites them, hedge funds can only blossom in a globalised world such as ours. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.53">
<s n="s1.1;p7.53">Moreover, financial authorities, unlike their tax counterparts, have little incentive to act in coordination while profit is being made, but have all incentive to join one another in action as systemic crises arise. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.53">
<s n="s1.6;p8.53">Tax have as a condition rationality, for public revenue is for tax authorities what profits are to an entrepreneur, but the former are entirely contingent upon the latter. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.53">If each tax authority elected to tax all resources available, they would drain off all incentive of private players to make money. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.53">Besides, as the opportunities of making profit are limited in the national level, firms and individuals often go abroad. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.53">If countries cannot strike a bargain as between themselves, double taxation would remove all incentive from overseas activities. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.53">Therefore, countries have much incentive to negotiate alongside lines previously known to all in the form of the Model Conventions. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.53">Conversely, Hedge Funds need diversity to flourish by exploiting differences in currency and interest policies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.53">
<s n="s1.2;p9.53">As to Hedge Funds, is the reverse: in the event all countries adopted the same economic policies in all respects, there would be short of opportunities. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.53">HFs would never flourish under a Fiscal Leviathan, but would be in serious jeopardy under Hobbesian anarchy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.53">
<s n="s1.2;p10.53">National authorities the world wide must, therefore, strike a very delicate balance between their wealth acquisition and their conduct regulation practices, their need to combine occasional collaboration with their overseas counterparts without dismissing the competitive aspects of the interaction between inside and outside the limits of their territory, within and beyond the limits of their sovereignty. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.53">In this respect, as we will be analysing, US and UK authorities seem to have taken different stances in their approaches to hedge funds, with the latter being much laxer then former, with seemingly better results - at least up to now<ref target="BAWE_0428b-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

<p n="p11.53">
<s n="s1.1;p11.53">In fact, devising an ideal strategy, either municipal or global, for regulating hedge funds is no easy task, but it does give us much food for thought on new challenges of law and regulation of securities and financial markets and possible strategies that may be developed to tackle them, as this is time when long-established distinctions, such as private and public, hard law v. soft law, all blur, and the view of the state as a harmonious whole is no longer tenable, but a new supra-state is not yet born. </s>

<p n="p23.53">
<s n="s1.3;p23.53">It seems to us that the expression "regulation" in the title of this essay should be given a broad meaning if it is to be given a proper answer. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.53">Therefore, while analyzing whether a particular country is in position of curbing threats of financial crises, an overall view of the applicable law thereto will be required, instead of a quick look at current measures of the specialized regulatory agency, for ultimately a country will need the full force of its whole legal system if it is to sort out this crises, and even that may not suffice - for systemic crises triggered by HFs may assume gargantuan proportions requesting a global response by gathering regulators all over the world<ref target="BAWE_0428b-ftnote.024"/>, all to act in a ad hoc basis in a very much impromptu way, responding to circumstances as they present themselves. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.53">Anyway, before we give a definitive answer, we should have an overall view the tools that the UK legal system possesses to carve out a solution. </s>

<p n="p24.53">
<s n="s1.4;p24.53">In the UK, the chief regulatory agency as to securities is the Financial Services Authority (FSA), as is the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US, the Bank of England performing pretty much the same role of the Federal Reserve as the local central bank. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.53">Prone to a British tradition of self-regulation of the markets, the FSA is perhaps less rigid than the SEC, which is constantly involved in litigation with investors in judicial proceedings. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.53">The FSA refrains from regulating hedge funds directly, as most of these have their central management and control offshore, therefore outside the reach of its powers - whose exercise abroad cannot be required for other countries as it would amount to a denial of sovereignty thereto. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.53">Nevertheless, Hedge Funds normally keep permanent establishments in the cities where most of their prospective clients are located, mainly New York and London, therefore within full reach of local laws and regulations. </s>

<p n="p25.53">
<s n="s1.2;p25.53">US stance is in stark contrast with UK's in that, thanks to doctrines such as the effects theory, as well as blatantly extraterritorial statutes such as the FCPA, ATCA, RICO, and worldwide tax liability, an expression whose construction is entirely in the discretion of the Magistrate applying the law, who will ponder interests while considering the circumstances. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.53">Moreover, the crude wording of statutes such as the Patriot Act provides them with various opportunities to assert its jurisdiction to traditional hedge fund locations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.53">
<s n="s1.1;p26.53">In contrast, UK, even before being bound by EU laws, had always fare more modest long-arm statutes, and not much more than one big exception to extraterritorial rules _ worldwide asset freezing orders, once known as Mareva injunctions. </s>

<p n="p47.53">
<s n="s1.1;p47.53">The introduction of the Capital Requirements Directive will mark a huge step forward in developing a modern capital framework that will improve the risk sensitivity of capital standards for firms across the EU. Considerable uncertainties remain, however, not least in the timing of its introduction </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.53">
<s n="s1.1;p48.53">It should be noted that, despite apparent (arguably, intended) loopholes, the 2000 Act provides for a own-initiative power, which provides the FSA with considerable discretion in activity. </s>

<head rend="underlined">FSA's own-initiative power</head>
<p n="p49.53">
<s n="s1.12;p49.53">Under Section 45. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p49.53">(1) of the FSMA, FSA may exercise its power under an authorised person not only where he judges that is he is failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy certain threshold conditions, but also, in a very broadly written clause, where "(c) it is desirable to exercise that power in order to protect the interests of consumers or potential consumers." </s>
<s n="s3.12;p49.53">It may go as far as varying permissions already granted to UK authorised firms following acquisition of their control by foreign firms as well as, under Section 47. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p49.53">Most significantly, it may assist overseas regulators in respect of an authorised person. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p49.53">In that event, it must, while deciding whether or not to exercise that power in response to the request, consider whether it is necessary to do so in order to comply with a Community obligation. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p49.53">For that purpose, it may take into account in particular criteria of reciprocity. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p49.53">Besides, it nearly resuscitates the practice of the double actionability rule, as it excuses itself from cooperating if the practice does not constitutes a breach of law in the UK . </s>
<s n="s8.12;p49.53">It also cites non-recognition of the jurisdiction is not recognized by the United Kingdom, as if systemic crises would spare a market of the importance of the UK in view of diplomatic considerations. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p49.53">More understandably, the relevance of the case is a factor taking into consideration. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p49.53">Phrasing that it will "consider the importance to persons in the United Kingdom" may appear reasonable, but shows little sensitivity to the current interconnectedness of financial markets. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p49.53">Public interest is by far the most acceptable criteria - as in some cases this may not coincide with the interest of the overseas regulators, being the interest of the British public whist abiding by widely acknowledge standards. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p49.53">Lastly, the requirement for previous commitment of undertaking contributions for the FSA to meet the costs of carrying on its action, without any exception, seems a bit unreasonable in the example of a request of an authority of a poor country whose market has a background of money laundering, as is the case of Burma. </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.53">
<s n="s1.1;p50.53">This seems to us an unacceptable parochial view in many respects. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p51.53">
<s n="s1.2;p51.53">From the very beginning it might have been tempting to state that not only UK's, but all national financial regulations inadequate to protect as to financial crisis, for the very simple reason that regulators are limited in their action to the limits of their territory and slow in their bureaucratic habits, whilst hedge funds are hectic and global. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p51.53">Besides, it might be contended that much of British "unregulation" is a conscious policy, as the FSA is in fact striking a bargain with funds by allowing them a larger margin of freedom than the US so that it can reap the benefits of their profit maximization techniques. </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.53">
<s n="s1.2;p52.53">On the other hand, it is clear that, although the FSA does abide by certain virtually universal standards financial market regulation, an absolute uniformity of rules is in any way desirable, as might be the case as to taxation, for it would dry off various sources of liquidity for the global economy. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p52.53">In the present state, though, there is not much the UK can do on its own - except, perhaps, lobby for the development of a new global financial architecture whilst acknowledging for the differences between countries, and assigning them different functions by allowing them to enact alternative standards. </s>
</p>
<p n="p53.53">
<s n="s1.3;p53.53">In Westphalia, the Great Powers gathered an decided the Switzerland, which had not sent any representatives, should remain neutral. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p53.53">Surprisingly enough, not only it still is and is likely to remain as such, as it also has never had its neutrality violated. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p53.53">Perhaps the time for a new Westphalia has come. </s>
