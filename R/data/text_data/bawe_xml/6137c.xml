<p n="p2.33">
<s n="s1.2;p2.33">A study of the atomic and magnetic structure of melt-spun amorphous Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi> was carried out by Alex Hannon in 1991.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It may initially be thought that the structure of an amorphous material could be modelled by a random packing of hard spheres; however, it was found that there were no Ni-Ni contacts in the material, which would not be expected from such a model. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.33">A more ordered structural model is therefore needed which takes this into account. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.33">
<s n="s1.3;p3.33">The aim of this project is to discover whether a possible atomic structure for Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi> can be found using a model based on a random packing of hard spheres, but including forcing the Ni atoms apart to the distance found in the above experiment; or whether further modifications to this model would be needed to find a structure. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.33">I will write a computer program in fortran 95 to try to find a possible structure for Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.33">The topic is of interest because rare earth-transition metal glasses such as this have been studied little <hi rend="sup">1</hi>, and the structure of this material is still not understood. </s>

<head rend="bold">Amorphous metals</head>
<p n="p4.33">
<s n="s1.4;p4.33">Amorphous metals were first discovered in 1959 by Duwez and associates <hi rend="sup">2,3</hi>, who found that it was possible to form a glassy alloy by quenching a mixture of liquid metals. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.33">Since then many different amorphous metals (also called metallic glasses if they have been cooled from the liquid state <hi rend="sup">4</hi>) have been created. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.33">In order to prevent crystallisation, the liquid metal must be cooled very rapidly. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.33">In the melt-spinning technique, this is done by a jet of molten metal hitting a rapidly rotating copper wheel, so that it is cooled at a rate of around 10 <hi rend="sup">6</hi> K s <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>, and a very thin ribbon of metallic glass is produced.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Amorphous metals are almost always alloys; recently pure amorphous metals have been produced, but they crystallise well below room temperature so are of little practical use. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.33">
<s n="s1.3;p5.33">Amorphous metals were the focus of considerable interest during the late 1970s and 1980s <hi rend="sup">4</hi>, because of their unusual physical properties: they are hard, ductile, not brittle and are relatively good electrical conductors <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.33">The magnetic properties of amorphous alloys containing ferromagnetic materials were of greatest interest, as it was found that they could be magnetised and demagnetised with little loss of energy.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Despite this, amorphous metals have not yet found widespread practical application; the reasons for this include problems with cost and the difficulty of producing bulk blocks of the material. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.33">However, amorphous metals may yet be put to wider use, and the field is still one of interest which is not fully understood. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.33">
<s n="s1.2;p6.33">X-ray or neutron diffraction studies are used to study the structure of amorphous metals. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.33">The data can be used to produce a graph of the partial correlation function <hi rend="italic">t</hi>(<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) against distance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> for particular combinations of atoms, where <hi rend="italic">t</hi>(<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) is given by: </s>

<s n="s2.3;p8.33">The radial distribution function, which gives the number of atoms of a particular type at a distance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> from any atom, is found by multiplying <hi rend="italic">t</hi>(<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) by <hi rend="italic">r</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.33">As the experimental data is one-dimensional, it is impossible to find a conclusive three-dimensional structure, but a possible structure may be found. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.33">
<s n="s1.4;p9.33">These studies have shown that metallic glasses are very densely packed, and also that they have a higher degree of short-range order than liquids; this is shown by the second peaks of the partial correlation functions splitting into two 'shoulders'.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Studies of metal-metalloid glasses have shown that metalloid-metalloid nearest neighbours do not occur, as would be expected in a dense random packing structure.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This is the same feature that occurred in the Hannon experiment, with no contact between transition metal atoms. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.33">One suggestion for the structure of Dy <hi rend="sub">7</hi>Ni <hi rend="sub">3</hi> is that the Dy atoms may be arranged in trigonal prisms, as occurs in the crystal form of dysprosium nickel. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.33">The Ni atoms would be in the centres of the prisms, and hence not in contact with each other. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.33">Randomly arranging these prisms would give a Dy:Ni ratio of 6:1, so in order for the atomic ratio to be correct, some Dy atoms would have to be shared between prisms. </s>
