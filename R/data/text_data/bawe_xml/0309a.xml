<s n="s4.4;p2.81">As it is a positive skew, most of the data lies on the left hand side of the graph (more students spend less hours on statistics). </s>

<p n="p3.81">
<s n="s1.4;p3.81">I also plotted a scatter graph to analyse the relation between the qtmark and the proportion of classes attended (attc) (Graph 2; appendix p1). </s>

<p n="p4.81">
<s n="s1.5;p4.81">From the correlation tables, we can see that the strongest correlation is between qtmark and attl, where the correlation of results and the proportion of lectures attended is strong and positive (0.3739). </s>

<s n="s3.5;p4.81">The strongest correlation is between attc and attr (0.74998). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.81">Such strong correlation between the two may be a sign of imperfect multicollinearity and should not be taken together when running regressions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.81">This is because it becomes increasingly harder to identify their separate effects and one of the variables should be dropped. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p76.81">As table 6.1 (appendix p7) shows, the t-prob of variables are very close to zero (if not zero), except for hrsqt where it is 0.0325. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p76.81">We then reject the null hypothesis for each of the variables ability, attc, attr and alevelsa at 1% level of significance, as well as the null for hrsqt at 5% significance level. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p76.81">The t-prob of the f-test is also zero meaning that we also reject the null hypothesis of joint significance. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p78.81">With the exchange rate of the pound high, not many international students are able to afford studying here in the UK and therefore, most of them are scholarship holders, sponsored by their home government and private companies. </s>
