<s n="s1.1;p92.100">To improve it even further; a robot can wind up the string and release the mass, to ensure that each repeated experiment is exactly the same. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p94.100">If I was to design a better experiment, it would probably have the disc rotating from rest with a controlled constant acceleration up to a point where terminal velocity (measure the time taken to get from rest to terminal velocity), where past the terminal velocity, it would be unsafe. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p94.100">This Apparatus would be hard to construct, because to maintain acceleration, there would have to be a control/feedback mechanism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p95.100">
<s n="s1.2;p95.100">As stated in the Analysis, the predicted shift of the results of higher mass wasn't present. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p95.100">This could be the result of not enough friction being produced, or some sort of human error. </s>
</p>
<p n="p96.100">
<s n="s1.1;p96.100">Using laser technology, you could place laser beams intermittent of the displacement, to plot the change in acceleration in further experiments. </s>

<s n="s4.8;p99.100">As discussed before, it is mainly the error of the measuring rule that has increased the error value. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p99.100">This cannot be helped because no other source was available or indeed feasible at the time to measure lengths more accurately than a rule. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p99.100">If a strong recommendation was to be made, it would be to use a more accurate form of a rule (to improve results). </s>
<s n="s7.8;p99.100">This would be because of the small values for the Moment of Inertia in this experiment. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p99.100">It would be satisfactory if a rule of the same accuracy was used when there would be a high Moment of Inertia. </s>
