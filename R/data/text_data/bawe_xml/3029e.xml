<p n="p1.8">
<s n="s1.4;p1.8">A priority of conservation biologists is to assess primate population densities in order to determine conservation status and identify species most urgently in need of protection. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.8">To ensure a precise estimate of population density it is essential that appropriate research techniques be employed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.8">In order make an educated choice it is essential to be familiar with the species ecology (e.g. home range, nocturnal / diurnal / cathemeral, breeding season, detectibility) and the area of study, prior to commencing research. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.8">This can be achieved by carrying out a pilot study, through extensive reading or by conducting interviews with locals. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Research methods</head>
<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.6;p2.8">Actual population density can be acquired through a Direct Count. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.8">To ensure accuracy all animals must be easily detected, clearly seen and reliably identified (Sutherland, 2000). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.8">A census of <hi rend="italic">Aloatta pigra</hi> was carried out using a variety of methods to thoroughly search the study site and confirm the correct identity of all individuals (Estrada et al., 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.8">Not only did this method take several days to complete, but, assuming animals learnt to avoid commonly used paths, repeatedly walking the existing trail system possibly resulted in unreliable results. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.8">The survey provided preliminary results only and it was concluded that further assessments be carried out in the area to test consistency (Estrada et al., 2002). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.8">Actual counts can be unsuccessful in acquiring primate population densities and often it is more accurate to estimate absolute populations from representative samples through Qudrat or Distance Sampling. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.8">
<s n="s1.14;p3.8">Quadrat sampling involves the observer assessing population density in replicate plots within the study site. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p3.8">This method is used to carry out indirect observations, counting sedentary objects such as dung or nests. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p3.8">Indirect sampling has been employed to census population densities of a range of Great Ape species (Buij, Singleton, Krakauer &amp; van Schaik, 2003; McNeilage et al, 1997). </s>
<s n="s4.14;p3.8">To estimate the population of <hi rend="italic">Pan troglodytes verus</hi> in southeastern Senegal systematic line-transects of chimpanzee nests were conducted (Pruetz, et al., 2002). </s>
<s n="s5.14;p3.8">Transects radiated from a central point traversing a range of habitats providing unbiased results, once the results had been weighted according to the proportion of habitats within the chimpanzee home range. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p3.8">It was assumed that each weaned primate built a new nest every 24 hrs and the duration of each nest was consistent throughout. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p3.8">Only "fresh nests" were counted and decay rate was measured according to a scale determined in a previous study allowing comparisons to be made (Baldwin et al., 1984; Fernandez and Tutin, 1981). </s>
<s n="s8.14;p3.8">No fresh nests were observed along line transects radiating along systematic compass points so, in addition, areas known to be most used by chimpanzees were selectively sampled. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p3.8">This method also relied on every animal being seen or detected within each plot. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p3.8">Small teams covered areas working in a series of strip transects to improve vigilance. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p3.8">Employing multiple observers in a single area made it necessary to mark the objects being counted to avoid double counting. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p3.8">Strip transects require determining a cut-off point according to the distance that the observer can see animals. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p3.8">In dense forest areas species density may be under estimated due to poor visibility. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p3.8">To overcome this, Parallel Transects can be used. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.8">
<s n="s1.4;p4.8">Parallel transects require the observer to be familiar with the study site and are often used in long-term study areas. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.8">During <hi rend="italic"> Gorilla gorilla beringei</hi> censoring at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park a sweep of the study site was conducted (McNeilage et al, 2001), thoroughly covering the entire area and allowing a large amount of data to be collected fairly rapidly. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.8">Parallel transects avoid bias caused by single line transects which often misrepresent features such as vegetation type, within the study area (Ross &amp; Reeve, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.8">Results obtained agreed with previous studies in the area indicating a reliable data collecting technique. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.8">
<s n="s1.4;p5.8">Like the parallel transect method Distance Sampling eradicates limitations caused by poor visibility, but requires less ground to be covered. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.8">It may be more useful when surveying unexplored areas of dense forest. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.8">This method assumes only a proportion of animals will be detected along a randomly chosen line transect or within a plot. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.8">The total number of animals is determined from the proportion within a known distance according to species detectability. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.8">
<s n="s1.6;p6.8">Line Transects enable the observer to cover a large area while recording constantly and are often a favoured technique when studying wide ranging primates occurring at low densities (Ross &amp; Reeve, 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.8">Line transects should be carried out at a standardized speed and new trails cut in straight lines. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.8">Following established trails regularly used for additional activities such as hunting or logging will cause bias (Sutherland, 2000). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.8">Due to time restraints, topography and to limit habitat damage it may be more appropriate to follow existing trail systems as illustrated in a three-month study of <hi rend="italic">Eulemur fulvus</hi> carried out in South-eastern Madagascar. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.8">Despite conducting test surveys of proposed methods, results were unreliable. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.8">Low, imprecise density estimates resulted from short transects and too few replications (Johnson and Overdorff, 1998). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.8">
<s n="s1.5;p7.8">In situations where terrain is particularly treacherous Point Sampling can be employed (Nguyen, 2000). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.8">Point sampling causes minimal disturbance and is extremely useful when studying highly conspicuous or nocturnal primates (Gursky, 1998). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.8">The absolute density of <hi rend="italic">Propithecus tattersalli</hi> in an area of North-eastern Madagascar was assessed using fixed-point sampling from high altitude observation points (Vargas et al., 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.8">While this method does not allow for detailed data on group composition or habitat type, it can provide reliable information on species presence across a geographic range, assuming the landscape is clear and the species highly visible. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.8">Independent data points may be obtained from point sampling, useful for management purposes and this method avoids inaccuracies caused by inadequate transects (Sutherland 2000). </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p8.8">
<s n="s1.4;p8.8">No single method is the most accurate in measuring population density of primates. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.8">In practice, population surveys are never completely without bias. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.8">Often more successful studies employ a range of sampling techniques in order to minimise limitations. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.8">From the knowledge acquired as a result of accurate density sampling realistic conservation goals can be set and future losses prevented. </s>
