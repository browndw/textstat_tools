<s n="s1.7;p1.17">In this opening quotation George Eliot highlights a crucial theme that pervaded not only her novels but also her private life; the role of the outsider. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.17">Eliot's refusal to attend church with her father between the January and May of 1842, the translation of prominent anti-Christian texts; namely Strauss's <hi rend="italic">Life of Jesus (1844-46)</hi> and Feuerbach's <hi rend="italic">Essence of Christianity (1854)</hi>, and her relationship with the married George Lewes secured her own status as a religious and social transgressor. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.17">These histories strongly suggest that the characters of her first novel, <hi rend="italic">Adam Bede (1859),</hi> would experience similar rejections. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.17">Indeed, the quotation cited demonstrates the perennial ethics of a traditional, provincial community like Hayslope which will not tolerate those characters who do not conform to the tenets and codes of behaviour established in this bucolic pastoral world. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.17">A character's social and moral integrity is established by their adherence to these implicit codes. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.17">Dorothy Van Ghent concurs that there is a "mute recognition by which the community lives...it is a recognition that personal good has communal determinations." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s7.7;p1.17">Therefore, to explore the category of the outsider it is beneficial to analyse Eliot's literary methods, the treatment of her characters and the intellectual tropes concerning realism, Darwinism and the religion of humanity. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p2.17">Therefore, those characters that introduce these anomalies are considered outsiders. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.17">Accordingly, the reader must also keep in mind that without the existence of typically good characters like; Adam, Seth, Lisbeth and Mr Poyser, their antithesis's, the outsiders; Hetty, Dinah and Arthur would not exist, as Eliot highlights all 'men's lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe.'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.004"/> </s>

</p>
<p n="p4.17">
<s n="s1.7;p4.17">Eliot portrays her protagonist, Adam Bede, as a 'Saxon' <ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.005"/> who embodies the traditional values and beliefs of bucolic Hayslope. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.17">His defining characteristics of strength and intellect establish him as no 'ordinary character among workmen'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.006"/> and the moral yardstick by which all other characters are measured by the reader. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.17">Indeed, the religious significance of his name can easily be assimilated to Adam in the Garden of Eden. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.17">Accordingly, his employment as a carpenter is reminiscent of Jesus' vocation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.17">Similarly, his brother Seth is an insider due to his obliging ' benignant'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.007"/> behaviour, but Eliot is keen to highlight his inferiority in comparison to the muscular Adam by denoting the prominent 'coronal arch', which according to the science of phrenology that was introduced to Eliot by George Combes, is a sign of weakness in a man. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.17">Their mother, Lisbeth, at times alienates the readers through her constant fretting but this is overwhelmed by her enduring 'mother's voice,' <ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.008"/>which links her to nature and therefore the community. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.17">Accordingly, her constant residence inside the family home consolidates her status as an insider, as she never strays outside to compromise or transgress her allotted social role. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p5.17">Eliot juxtaposes Adam's moral integrity with Arthur's fickle nature to establish his liminal status. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.17">Indeed, the religious connotations implicit in Adam's name suggest that Arthur's betrayal of Adam is equivalent to Judas' betrayal of Jesus. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.17">This suggestion is supported by Arthur's 'absence'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.009"/> at Thias Bede's funeral. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.17">In his affair with Hetty, Arthur is forced to meet her, neither on a farm nor on an estate, but on 'the Chase,'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.010"/> a liminal place where they are free to explore their erotic desires without the condemnation of the community. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.17">Indeed, Arthur must undergo a symbolic death during his fight with Adam in the grove, to emerge understood but not forgiven by the community, for Eliot makes it clear to the reader that 'our deeds determine us as much as we determine our deeds,'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.011"/> suggesting that Arthur is responsible for his actions and no malign fate is at work. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.17">Valentine Cunningham agrees that 'Eliot was doubtful that destiny was determined entirely by character." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s7.8;p5.17">Here Eliot is seen to be exploring contemporary thoughts on Determinism within her text. </s>

<s n="s2.9;p7.17">She is an integral part of the community, however, it is her outspoken nature, similar to Chaucer's Wife of Bath that classifies Mrs Poyser as an outsider. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.016"/>

<s n="s5.9;p7.17">Interestingly, Mrs Poyser is never punished for her strident remarks to the Old Squire Donnithorne. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p7.17">I feel this is because her strong dialect and comical idioms undermine the strength of her arguments. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p7.17">Raymond Williams agrees that these dialects evoke " a ballad element which denies (her) the possibility of articulating ideas and developing a higher consciousness." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s8.9;p7.17">This suggests that Mrs Poyser would not flourish outside Hayslope, yet Eliot creates the impression of Mrs Poyser's larger than life character being constrained by her social role within the community. </s>

<s n="s5.8;p12.17">The 'murder of her child'<ref target="BAWE_3001e-ftnote.024"/> simultaneously contradicts religious beliefs and indicates her denial of the natural role of motherhood, both actions heavily transgressing the traditional ethics of Hayslope. </s>
