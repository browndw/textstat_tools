<head rend="underlined bold">Self-Excitation Check</head>
<p n="p15.109">
<s n="s1.7;p15.109">Before our investigation, it is important to ensure that the generator can self-excite i.e. without relying on an external power source. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p15.109">This can be done by connecting the dc shunt generator to a three phase supply from the variable voltage unit to the induction motor. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p15.109">The rated voltage when the induction motor is connected in star (380V line to line). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p15.109">This is approximately 85% on the variable voltage unit. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p15.109">The dc machine must be connected as illustrated in the instruction sheet. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p15.109">The induction motor is then switched on and the dynamometer controller to measure speed. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p15.109">If generator fails to self excite, there are several possible causes: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p16.109">
<s n="s1.4;p16.109">There may be no residual flux in the generator thus the generator will not be able to start. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.109">If no residual flux exists then there is no voltage build up. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.109">In this situation disconnect the field from the armature circuit and connect directly to an external dc supply (e.g. a battery); this will thus allows current to flow for one instant and thus when dc supply is removed and original circuitry reconnected then a residual flux will be left in the poles. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.109">This process of adding an external dc source is better known as "flashing the field". </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p17.109">
<s n="s1.6;p17.109">The field resistance may be adjusted to a value greater than the critical resistance. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.109">Under normal operating conditions the shunt generator has an increase in its magnetisation curve up to the point where it intersects the field resistance. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.109">At the point where the field resistance is parallel to the magnetisation curve the generator can fluctuate widely with only tiny changes in field resistance or armature current. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.109">This resistance value is known as the critical resistance. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.109">If the field resistance exceeds the critical resistance (i.e. gradient becomes steeper) then the steady-state operating voltage is essentially at the residual level, and it never builds up. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.109">In order to cure this problem it would be advisable to reduce the field resistance. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p18.109">
<s n="s1.4;p18.109">The generator rotation direction may have been reversed or field connections may have been reversed. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.109">In both cases residual flux produces an internally generated voltage. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.109">The voltage then produces a field current which produces a flux which opposes the residual flux, instead of increasing it. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.109">In this case no voltage build up is possible and to solve this problem, we just flash the field with an opposite magnetic polarity or by reversing field connections. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.109">
<s n="s1.2;p19.109">Finally, the shunt generator may be switched off once all the above tests have been completed. </s>
