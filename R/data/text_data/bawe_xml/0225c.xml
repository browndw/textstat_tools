<s n="s5.6;p1.10">The fact this case reached the most Supreme Court in the English hierarchy of courts and that it created a new precedent, highlights its impact on the development of the law of negligence, in particular in cases were proximity between parties is not of contractual or fiduciary nature but akin to it. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p4.10">Although the defendant had the professional ability to provide reliable advice and that the it was provided in a professional environment, the fact that Heller and Partners Ltd choose to place a disclaimer demonstrated that the defendant did not voluntarily assume responsibility<ref target="BAWE_0225c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.10">In addition the defendant must know for what purposes his/her services are required, for whom they are required and that the listener will act upon them without any further clarification. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.10">Although Heller and partners new that an advertising agent, client of the National Provincial Bank, inquired the reference, they did not know for what purpose and if it would be solely relied upon. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.10">The claimants should have considered the bank's conflicting position before relying entirely on the reference.<ref target="BAWE_0225c-ftnote.004"/> The enquiry was a quick free of charge check on Easipower´s credit potential rather than a detailed and considered advise on the matter. </s>
