Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s1.4;p1.12">The experiment was carried out using a Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller and IER Embedded Workbench. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.12">The given incomplete code which was written in C was completed, then debugged using C-Spy and executed via the hardware. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.12">This procedure was used to control one of the two 7-segmant LED displays to display a clockwise rotational pattern, all segments simultaneously and decimal point. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.12">Then the pattern starts again. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Procedure</head>
<p n="p2.12">
<s n="s1.2;p2.12">First the IER Embedded Workbench is opened and a new project is opened. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.12">This program supports the Mitsubishi M16 microprocessor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.4;p3.12">Then the created project is set to default factory settings after choosing ICCM16C and X-Link in the project options. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.12">The program C-Spy was chosen as the debugger. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.12">Then in the project files the incomplete C code, .xcl file and .s34 file was selected. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.12">Then the incomplete C code was opened and the missing codes were entered. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.3;p4.12">The M16C development board was then connected to the power supply and the PC via the serial link. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.12">Then the circuit board was switched on and .s34 and .xcl files were added to the project. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.12">The C-Spy was run as the debugger and the program was executed in the ROM monitor mode via the M16 development board. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.1;p5.12">Then a clockwise rotational pattern display, simultaneous all segment display and the decimal point display could be observed repeatedly on the first 7-segment LED display. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">Problems encountered in Completing the missing codes in the C program Code:</head>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.1;p6.12">Even though there was a slight problem with figuring out the missing hex codes for the right LED segments, after studying the hex code to binary code conversion and the pattern in the unsigned char display codes it was easy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.1;p7.12">The rest of the missing codes were straight forward but there was a code missing in the main loop with out the 'missing code' sign. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.2;p8.12">The other difficulty was that the C file (ass2.c) provided was a corrupted file and could not be opened using the project in the IER workbench software. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.12">The C code had to be opened in Microsoft Visual Studio the copied to the C file in the IER Workbench. </s>
