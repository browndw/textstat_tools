<s n="s1.4;p1.19">The Great Leap Forward was an initiative put forward by Mao Zedong which was ratified in May of 1958 at the Second Session of Eight Party Congress and was chiefly an attempt to catch up with the West in economic terms. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.19">Mao focussed on setting grain and steel targets to boost production and moulded the existing cooperatives into a smaller number of communes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.19">He wanted to achieve this through a process of 'walking on two legs' by combining modern, large-scale capital intensive methods with traditional, small-scale methods of production. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.19">However, despite these seemingly good intentions the Great Leap Forward was a one of the biggest failures in China's recent history and there are a number of reasons for its lack of success. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.19">
<s n="s1.3;p2.19">One important reason to consider is how much it was solely Mao's influence and how much he personally was responsible for the Great Leap Forward's (GLF) lack of success. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.19">Obviously as the most powerful man within the Chinese Communist Party the majority of authority lay with him and certainly "Mao himself, as with the Hundred Flowers earlier, again was clearly the critical figure pushing forward an innovative program"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.19">Of course this alone does not necessarily mean he was the reason for its unsuccessful path but there are a number of examples of how Mao did indeed make the situation worsen and reach crisis point. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.19">Some historians have concentrated on Mao's utopian views perhaps not allowing to him to see the actual situation and having too much faith in human nature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.19">His decision to call the process a 'Leap' forward shows he knew how much he wanted to achieve against a very small time scale and he has been criticised for not thoroughly planning how would be the most effective way of doing so. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.19">Mao knew how far China was behind the West in terms of their economy but seemed to believe that having faith in socialism overtaking capitalism would be enough. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.19">It was almost as though he was actually "convinced that he had a formula for boosting agricultural production which would guarantee the success of his utopian plans"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.002"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.19">It could be argued that Mao's desire to beat the West overshadowed everything else and led him to have such a blinkered view that ultimately he would have done anything to achieve his goal. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.19">So even if he did not have an infallible belief in human nature before he came to power, he forced himself into believing that "human will and energy, properly mobilised can overcome any objective impediments to revolutionary change and economic development"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.19">All of this contributed towards the impossibly ambitious aims and methods Mao pushed forward and which were the some of the main causes for the number of people who suffered as a result of the GLF. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.19">Even in the official Resolution on Party History ultra left deviations were blamed and Mao's policies of "excessive targets, the issuing of arbitrary directions, boastfulness, and stirring up of a 'communist wind'"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.004"/> are all identified as reasons for the failure of the GLF. It could be argued that if Mao had set more realistic targets within a larger time scale the GL may have enjoyed some success but instead he set huge targets mainly in grain and steel production. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.19">It was not only those who already worked in these areas who had to contribute, "Everyone had to meet a quota by handing over their metal possessions." </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.19">However it was not solely Mao who was responsible for these policies and ambitious targets, the entire leadership of the Party can have part of the blame attributed to them at least. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.19">The Party had been extremely successful up until the period of the GLF and maybe they could not envisage one of their policies completely failing in such a way. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.19">The "combination of inexperience and arrogance that it said to have characterized the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.006"/> could have led to the devastating impact that the GLF had on the Chinese people. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.19">This may have led the leadership into falling into Mao's train of thought where they let "their own revolutionary aspirations overwhelm their appreciation of the material and ideological constraints on what was possible to do at that point in time"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.007"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.19">One glaring example of this is Mao's treatment of the Minister of Defence, Marshall Peng Duhuai, who was one of the few people to report back to the Party that things were not actually as good as they appeared to be when he toured parts of the country in the autumn of 1958.<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.009"/> The result of this was that in the Lushan plenum in 1959, Peng and other supposed 'rightists' were purged and Mao sent a clear signal that criticism would not be tolerated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.19">This one incident had a dramatic effect on the success of the GLF as it meant that a new upsurge in radicalism took place in 1959 and 1960 as "everyone was eager to demonstrate that they leaned to the 'left' instead of to the 'right'"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.19">This has led to the argument that if enough senior leaders had dared to stand up to Mao "the famine could easily have been arrested after the first year of the GLF"<ref target="BAWE_0244n-ftnote.011"/> and the number of people who died would have been greatly reduced. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p15.19">The existence of communal places to eat, where theoretically one was allowed to eat as much as you liked, meant that none of the excess food was saved and when the leaders demanded sufficient food to feed the cities, neither the people in rural or urban areas had enough to eat. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p16.19">Furthermore Mao and the Party began to see the peasants as the enemy and not as a group that desperately needed help and freedom from the restrictions of the GLF. Party documents at the beginning of the GLF show that officials believed peasants to be standing in the way of progress and Mao even believed that the peasants were hiding their grain so he refused to open the state granaries to ease the crisis. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p17.19">Even if the Party had acted more quickly as the failure of the GLF policies began to emerge they still would have faced major difficulties due to the state planned structure of the Chinese economy not being able to cope or adapt to the situation. </s>
