<s n="s1.3;p22.37">P84 is a difunctional tri-block copolymer surfactant of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. </s>

It finds many varied applications owing to its surfactant properties, for example in pharmaceuticals as a drug solubilizer and delayed release agent, also in the textiles and detergents industries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.37">
<s n="s1.3;p23.37">The aqueous solubility of the both comonomers is temperature dependant, with the degree of solvation dropping with increasing temperature, hence a reduction in solubility. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.37">However, whilst oxyethylene is highly soluble at all temperatures in water (0º-100ºC), the solubility of oxypropylene is dramatically temperature dependant - being fairly soluble in water below 20ºC but nearly entirely insoluble above. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.37">Thus the amphiphillic behaviour of the triblock polymer exhibits interesting temperature dependence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.37">
<s n="s1.5;p24.37">As a surfactant, P84 in aqueous solution has a strong propensity for aggregation, leading to the formation of micelles; thus P84 is fairly soluble (>10% w/w, 25ºC). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.37">Prior to micellization, single-chained polymer-coil unimers of P84 exist in aqueous solution. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.37">Above the cmT (or cmC), spheroidial micelles form, with cores of partially solvated polypropylene oxide and highly solvated corona's of polyethylene oxide. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.37">By means of light scattering techniques, it has been observed that with increasing temperature, dehydration of the core occurs, and enables the elongative growth of the micelle to a thread-like structure as the aggregation number rises. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.37">Micellization is found to be dependant upon the ionic strength of solution, and the critical micellization temperature can be brought down by the addition of ionic salts. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p25.37">The co-dissolution of sodium chloride acts to raise the ionic strength of the solvent, which has the effect of lowering the critical micellular temperature and the micelle 'sphere to rod' (sol to gel) phase transition temperature. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p25.37">Under the conditions of the experiment, the temperatures range is such that the rod aggregation mode predominates in vast excess over spheroid and unimer modes. </s>

The transition from region AB to B at both temperatures is fairly abrupt, however the transition at 42ºC occurs at a significantly higher shear rate (which implies the force required for alignment is greater), and thus the plots intersect one another. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p30.37">At 37ºC (graph 5), the solution exhibits the bevahiour typical of non-Newtonian shear thinning fluids, with the three expected distinct regions: the early and ending portions of the Newtonian regimes, with the intervening power-law region. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.37">However, at 42ºC (graph 6) the linear plots are much less defined, with a more gradual transition from the early regime to the non-Newtonian regime; also, the ending data points show signs of noise. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.37">In order for more accurate analysis to be carried out at 42ºC, much lower sheer rates would need be investigated as the viscosity clearly drops significantly from Newtonian behaviour even over the lowest of investigated sheer rates. </s>

<p n="p34.37">
<s n="s1.3;p34.37">This suggests at the two extremes two different phases exist, and that at intermediate sheer rates, there is co-existence of the different phases. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.37">This can be rationalised by considering that in solution at zero sheer rate, thermal motion has the polymer rods intertwining into a random weaved network; and then as the solution has exerted onto it an increasing shear force, the molecules are 'dragged out' into alignment. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p36.37">At 37ºC, the rods are shorter and so the disordered phase (at low sheer rates) is less extensively networked, and thus exhibits a lower viscosity. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p36.37">The power law region is very similar, but is true for a shorter range of shear rates at 37ºC, which perhaps suggests a greater range of shear rates over which the coexistence of phases occurs at higher temperature (reflecting the requirement of more force to align up longer molecules). </s>
