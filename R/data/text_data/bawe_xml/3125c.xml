<s n="s1.4;p1.32">This paper is based on what I have discussed in my presentation which is meronymy of the English language. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.32">I will first explain the basic concepts. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.32">I will then give a detailed description about prototypic features in the relations. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.32">Finally I will conclude it by bringing the main points together. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.32">
<s n="s1.4;p2.32">To begin with meronymy is a semantic relation between units of meaning as hyponymy and synonymy (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.32">Meron means part and holos refers to whole in ancient Greek. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.32">A system based on meronymies is called mereology (Lobner, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.32">Mereological form is shown as below (Lobner, 2002: pp96): </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.32">
<s rend="bold" n="s1.1;p3.32">If A is a <hi rend="italic">meronym</hi> of B, then B is a <hi rend="italic">holonym</hi> of A. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.32">
<s n="s1.2;p4.32">As the term suggests meronymy shows a part-whole relation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.32">For example the figure below shows meronymy of body parts. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_3125c-fig.001">
<head>Figure: Meronymy of body part terms</head>
</figure>
<p n="p5.32">
<s n="s1.1;p5.32">body </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.32">
<s n="s1.1;p6.32">head neck leg arm </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.32">
<s n="s1.1;p7.32">ear face hand </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.32">
<s n="s1.1;p8.32">eye nose mouth finger palm </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.32">
<s n="s1.1;p9.32">lip tongue </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.32">
<s n="s1.1;p10.32">For example <hi rend="italic">finger is a meronym of hand</hi> means <hi rend="italic">a finger is a part of a hand</hi> while <hi rend="italic">hand is a holonym of finger</hi> refers to <hi rend="italic">hand has fingers</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.32">
<s n="s1.1;p11.32">In addition there is a logical form in meronymy as follows (Cruse, 2004: pp150): </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.32">
<s rend="bold italic" n="s1.2;p12.32">X is a meronym of Y. </s>
<s rend="bold" n="s2.2;p12.32"> </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.32">
<s rend="bold italic" n="s1.2;p13.32">For an entity A, A is in X entails A is in Y. </s>
<s rend="bold" n="s2.2;p13.32"> </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.32">
<s n="s1.6;p14.32">For example canteen is a part of Oxford Brookes University. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.32">Therefore John is in the canteen entails John is in Oxford Brookes University. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.32">However there are exceptions of this structure. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.32">For instance wheel is a part of a car. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.32">The wasp is on the wheel does not entail the wasp is <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the car. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.32">It should be the wasp is <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the car (Cruse, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.32">
<s n="s1.1;p15.32">Meronymic relations also apply to transitive structures as follows (Cruse, 2004: pp153): </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.32">
<s rend="bold" n="s1.1;p16.32">If A is wholly located within the part of B and B is wholly located within the part of C, Then A is necessarily wholly located within the part of C. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.32">
<s n="s1.1;p17.32">This form is acceptable with the following concepts, </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.32">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p18.32">Fingers are part of the hand. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.32">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p19.32">The hand is a part of the body. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.32">
<s n="s1.1;p20.32">Then, <hi rend="italic">Fingers are a part of the body.</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.32">
<s n="s1.3;p21.32">However all the relations do not always meet the transitive structure. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.32">This fact is easily understood when finger, hand and body relation is changed to finger, hand and arm relation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.32">The latter relation is shown as follows (Cruse, 2004: pp153): </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.32">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p22.32">Fingers are parts of the hand. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.32">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p23.32">The hand is a part of the arm. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.32">
<s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p24.32">Fingers are a part of the arm </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.32">
<s n="s1.9;p25.32">The last sentence does not sound correct which will be explained more later on. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p25.32">So far it has been discussed basic forms and functions in meronymy. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p25.32">It is said that there is sometimes a disagreement whether units of meaning are regarded as meronymy. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p25.32">For instance it is not entirely certain whether a pan lid is or is not part of a pan. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p25.32">It is affected by contextual factors such as whether the pan means a saucepan or a flying pan. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p25.32">The decision is also different between people (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s7.9;p25.32">Cruse (2004) suggests that prototypic features enable people to find meronymic relations. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p25.32">In other words units of meaning which have the features between them are generally more accepted as meronymy. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p25.32">The prototypic features are necessity, integrality, discreteness, motivation and congruence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.32">
<s n="s1.5;p26.32">The first feature is necessity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.32">It is to consider whether a part is essential for well-formed structures (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.32">For example beard is part of face but it is only optional. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.32">On the other hand nose is an essential part of well-formed face. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p26.32">Therefore it is said that nose-face relations are more prototypical than beard-face relations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.32">
<s n="s1.5;p27.32">The second characteristic is integrality. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.32">It is to think about whether a part is integrated or attached to the whole. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.32">For instance <hi rend="italic">the handle is a part of the door</hi> sounds normal when it changes to <hi rend="italic">the handle is attached to the door</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.32">However <hi rend="italic">the fingers are attached to the hand</hi> does not sound right compared to the previous sentence as the relation is more integrated than simply being attached to (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.32">In this view it is said that hand-finger relations are more prototypical. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.32">
<s n="s1.4;p28.32">The third aspect is Discreteness. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.32">It is about how a part moves independently from the whole. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.32">For example the tip of the tongue is not clearly separated from tongue while the division is rather clear in arm-body relations (The Everything Development Company, 2002). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.32">In this aspect the latter relation is more prototypical. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.32">
<s n="s1.5;p29.32">The fourth feature is Motivation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p29.32">It is about whether a part is functional to its whole. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p29.32">For instance the handle of a door enables people to grasp and open or shut the door as an identifiable function. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p29.32">The wheels of a car are for the car moving smoothly over the grounds (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p29.32">In other words these parts are more prototypic as a meronymic relation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.32">
<s n="s1.11;p30.32">The last feature is Congruence. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p30.32">There are separated features, range and phase. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p30.32">The first feature is range which shows how limited meronym is related to the holonym. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p30.32">Supermeronym is a meronymic relation with more than one holonym (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.11;p30.32">For example leg has chair, table, and human body as holonym. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p30.32">It is said that supermeronym is less prototypical meronymy since the meronym has a broad sense of holonym. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p30.32">The other feature of congruence is phase. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p30.32">It is to think about whether parts and wholes exist at the same time (Cruse, 2004). </s>
<s n="s9.11;p30.32">For instance grape juice and wine are both made of grapes and it is possible to say wine is a part of grape juice. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p30.32">However flour-bread relations are not the same case since flour is not quite part of bread but rather one ingredient of bread. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p30.32">Therefore the latter relation is less prototypical. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.32">
<s n="s1.3;p31.32">In conclusion meronymy is simply defined as a part-whole feature. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p31.32">However each unit of meaning is related differently. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p31.32">Therefore how meronymic relation is structured is only found by looking carefully at each relation with prototypical features. </s>
