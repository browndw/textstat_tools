<s n="s2.2;p13.37">The FIA provides both sporting and technical regulations that all competitors within a particular championship must comply to. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.37">
<s n="s1.5;p14.37">The Formula One World Championship is one such series that is governed by the FIA. The FIA has sporting and technical regulations that each team, car and driver must comply with in order to compete in each race of the championship. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.37">Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to a variety of penalties from race bans to expulsion from the Championship. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.37">If a team incurs such a penalty it can inflict financial damage due to loss of revenue associated with competing in races and also damage to the reputation of the team which could lead to reduced sponsorship. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.37">It is therefore necessary to make sure that all components on the racing car conform to the technical regulations as set out by the FIA. Appendix 1 shows two of the technical drawings that illustrate technical regulations which are supplied to Formula One teams showing the FIA rules regarding rear wing design, for example, Regulation 3.10.1 states: No part of the car behind the rear wheel centre line may be more than 800mm above the reference plane <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.37">The aerodynamic designers therefore need to design a rear wing that complies with these various regulations. </s>

<p n="p32.37">
<s n="s1.6;p32.37">CAD allows rapid and cost effective evaluation of a design. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p32.37">It is possible to test a large number of designs with relatively low cost compared to evaluating a large number of designs by manual techniques. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p32.37">Using manual techniques can be expensive, for example, using scale models and wind tunnels. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p32.37">If a small modification is made to the design it may be necessary to construct a new scale model at cost. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p32.37">Manual techniques are also expensive due to the cost of construction and running costs associated with wind tunnels. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p32.37">CAD allows small modifications to be made to the design and reduces the cost as no new prototype is needed as with manual techniques. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.37">
<s n="s1.3;p33.37">CAD has a relatively low investment compared with manual techniques as the computers and software are the only initial costs compared to manual prototyping techniques and wind tunnels. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.37">There is also hazard reduction when using CAD compared to prototype testing and many CAD promoters suggest that using computer aided design is more durable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.37">One of the largest benefits of using CAD is the ability to use the software to visualise the results of the analysis easily. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.37">
<s n="s1.4;p34.37">Not only is prototyping expensive but it raises scaling problems associated with using models that are smaller than the actual design. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.37">CAD overcomes these problems as it is possible to draw the sketch to the actual size of the component. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.37">Scaling problems arise in prototyping as using models of different sizes affects the Reynold Numbers achieved. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.37">With a different Reynold Number for the prototype this can lead to results of the prototype being different than those that will be achieved when the final component is tested, this can potentially be dangerous as the component could fail and cause injury as the correct prototype results were not obtained. </s>

<p n="p35.37">
<s n="s1.4;p35.37">CAD generates more information than other methods of analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p35.37">This can be both an advantage and disadvantage to the design process as a large amount of data can be harder to analyse, as the operator needs to be able to extract the correct information that will be useful for evaluating the design. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p35.37">It is necessary that the engineer using the software is skilled enough to evaluate the results but also configure the parameters. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p35.37">An over dependence of the engineer on the software/computer in configuring the parameters can lead to results having no value within the design problem </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.37">
<s n="s1.4;p36.37">Once CAD and analysis has been performed on a design it may be necessary to validate the results obtained, this is when manual techniques can provide useful. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p36.37">Within F1, teams still use wind tunnels to analyse the final design before going into production, to validate the results obtained from their computational fluid dynamic analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p36.37">F1 teams overcome the scaling problems by using a full size model of the car within the wind tunnel. </s>
