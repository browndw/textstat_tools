<p n="p24.34">
<s n="s1.2;p24.34">News reports indicate that early in 2006, the World Trade Organization is expected to rule in favour of the United States on a Bush Administration challenge to European delays in approving new types of genetically modified (GM) foods and various European Union member state bans on specific GM varieties. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.34">The current U.S. case does not challenge present European Community (EC) regulations on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), which include rules on safety testing, labelling and traceability, but concerns the EU's delay in granting new approvals of GM crops while the European-wide policies were being put into effect (6). </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.34">
<s n="s1.2;p25.34">The EU rules on labelling and traceability are in response to the consumers' demands for more and better information on GMOs and in the same time to facilitate the freedom of choice between new and traditional agricultural products. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.34">According to the EU officials, EU system is and will be science based, not driven by economic considerations (4). </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.34">
<s n="s1.3;p26.34">US were accusing EU of 'moratorium' applied in October 1998 in respect to approval of new GM varieties. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.34">Since then no GMOs have been authorized for release into the environment in the EU. This happened due to the fact that EU's regulatory regime was incomplete to address recent achievements of quickly changing GM technology. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.34">New EU regulatory framework was adopted in March 2001 and was entered into force in October 2001. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.34">
<s n="s1.2;p27.34">David Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer protection stated: 'We have been working hard in Europe to complete our regulatory system in line with the latest scientific and international developments. (...) </s>
<s n="s2.2;p27.34">This is essential to restore consumer confidence in GMO's in Europe'(4). </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.34">
<s n="s1.3;p28.34">The Bush Administration claims that the EU's delay in granting new GM crop approvals has resulted in lost markets for American farmers. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.34">But clearly consumers' preference for non-GM food is the true engine of the market collapse for American crops. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.34">Even before the delay in GM crop approvals began in 1998, U.S. corn sales to Europe had dropped by more than half (6). </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.34">
<s n="s1.2;p29.34">Commissioner Byrne recalled that it is the lack of consumer demand for GM-products that accounts for the law sales of GMOs in Europe. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.34">'Unless consumers see that the authorisation process is up to date and takes into account all legitimate concerns, consumers will continue to remain sceptical of GM products'(4). </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.34">
<s n="s1.4;p30.34">From the other hand taking into account example of soy, the US soybean growers cultivate only the GM soybean authorised in the UE, so that they have no problem with accessing EU markets. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.34">Different situation is in terms of maize, as in the US various GM maize varieties are cultivated, not only those approved by the EU. Decrease in US soybean and maize sales may also be explained by decreasing competition of the US agriculture on the world market. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.34">US farmers are no longer low-cost producers and are less and less able to compete especially with Argentina and Brazil. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.34">Those two in turn seem not to be affected by EU rules on GMOs. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.34">
<s n="s1.2;p31.34">Contrary to US claims, the UE is one of the largest importers of GMOs and derived food and feed. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.34">So far more than 30 GMOs or derived food and feed products have been approved for marketing in the EU (5). </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.34">
<s n="s1.3;p32.34">Food safety regulations in the UE are far stricter than in the US and logically it takes longer to approve a GMO in the EU, than in the US. Apart form differences in national regulations US refused to sign Cartagena Protocol on Biodiversity, which the EU considers to be the key international agreement governing the transboundary movements of GMOs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.34">The protocol has been signed by 130 countries, its aim is to ensure through international rules, that countries exporting and importing have the necessary information to make informed choices about GMOs (5). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.34">In line with Cartagena protocol is that sovereign body like the UE and its Member States or any other country in the world, has the right to enact its own regulations on the food its citizens would eat, providing that the measures are compatible with existing international rules and based on scientific evidence. </s>

<p n="p33.34">
<s n="s1.7;p33.34">North American consumers had begun to share European concerns about the risk of genetically modified crops, which was reflected in drop of GMOs consumption in the US (6). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p33.34">NGOs such as Greenpeace and Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) closely cooperating with Consumers International played a role in that shift in public opinion, having created an international coalition of organizations that oppose the use of GMOs (3). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p33.34">In the US Consumer Union (CU) is the organization, which is seriously involved into the battle against GMOs, highly specialized experts working for CU, provided many international organizations with their expertise. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p33.34">Consumers organizations on both sides of Atlantic apart form favouring global rule-based trading system highly opposed WTO decision. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p33.34">They however mutually agree that the recent WTO decision will not make European consumers accept GMOs any more than they do presently. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p33.34">As force-feeding never works, it is more likely that the WTO decision will have an adverse effect, if consumers feel that GMOs are being forced at them (1). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p33.34">In case of present dispute 'TACD has vigorously protested the United States suit and has repeatedly urged the US and the EU to resolve disputes over consumer, public health and environmental matters outside of the WTO where public interest regulations are regularly ruled against in the name of free trade'(6). </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p34.34">
<s n="s1.4;p34.34">From the information presented above one can see there are various factors influencing drop in US GMOs sales both in Europe as well in the US themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.34">Among those factors are increasing world competition on the GMO crop market, especially faced form Argentina and Brazil, but also increasing consumers awareness and pro-environmental attitudes all over the world. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.34">Challenging EU authorisation system and the right to sovereignty of the EU member states, which by the way is in accordance with international biodiversity agreement, seem not to be enough in order to rule in favour of the US in case of such delicate issue. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.34">Such questions as public health and environmental concerns seemed not to be addressed, maybe long awaited panel report will revel more firm arguments, on which panel decision was based. </s>
