<s n="s1.3;p1.19">Flour and glycine contain proteins, and all proteins contain nitrogen. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.19">Thus by determining the nitrogen content, we can calculate the protein content in these samples. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p2.19">From the experiment, sample is first digested by heating with concentrated sulfuric acid, catalyst and potassium sulfate (which raises the boiling point). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.19">In the presence of excess acid, nitrogenous matter is decomposed to carbon dioxide, water and ammonium sulfate (NH <hi rend="sub">4</hi>)<hi rend="sub">2</hi>SO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.19">Then the sample is distillated under reflex by adding an excess of concentrated (50%) sodium hydroxide (NaOH). </s>

</p>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.7;p3.19">However, before we start the distillation process, we need to add anti-bumping granules to ensure even heating inside the distillation flask. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p3.19">Water is also added to the stoppered funnel to avoid leakage. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.19">Make sure the delivery tube is dipped into boric acid so as to create a close system. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.19">Ammonium (NH <hi rend="sub">4</hi>) is converted to ammonia (NH <hi rend="sub">3</hi>), which has low boiling point, under alkaline condition and is collected under boric acid. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.19">NH <hi rend="sub">3</hi> reacts with boric acid to form borate which can then titrate with standard sulfuric acid. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Discussion</head>
<p n="p16.19">
<s n="s1.9;p16.19">Amino acids occur naturally in food proteins, but other amino acids may be found as a result of processing. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p16.19">The %N found experimentally is slightly higher than the one calculated from the molecular formula. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p16.19">But normally the yield of nitrogen obtained is a fraction less than that present in the protein. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p16.19">It is because complete digestion is hard to achieve. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p16.19">Some discrepancy between the calculated values and the actual values obtained is due to the physical differences in digestion. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p16.19">The temperature at which decomposition takes place will vary, depending upon the type of nitrogen linkage, i.e. whether amine, amide, nitro, heterocyclic and whether the compound is aliphatic or aromatic. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p16.19">The position of the nitrogen-containing group also possesses effect in the decomposition temperature. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p16.19">Thus the digestion temperature may not be high enough to decompose the sample. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p16.19">Some ammonium ions may be converted to volatile nitric acid. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.4;p17.19">The rate of distillation is dependent upon the temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.19">However, the greater portion of the ammonia will distill over during the first 5 or 10 minutes even with low heat. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.19">During the distillation process, the heat of reaction of sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide is great enough to cause loss of volatile ammonia. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.19">Distillation should be carried out under regulated conditions, for examples, to a specific volume or for a specified length of time. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.2;p18.19">Observation errors of the colour change at the end points may increase or decrease the amount of sulfuric acid used. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.19">It is better for us to use a reference solution for comparison of the end point. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.9;p19.19">Protein content is important for determining bread quality. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p19.19">There is a positive correlation between loaf specific volume and the percentage protein present. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p19.19">The prevalence of wheat flour for making aerated bread is due to the properties of its protein. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p19.19">Wheat with reasonably high protein content is called strong wheat. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p19.19">An elastic, cohesive and three-dimensional structured substance called gluten forms once the flour is mixed with water. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p19.19">Flour from strong wheat usually requires more water then flour from weak wheat (with lower protein content) and in turn flour with high water absorption capacity is preferred for breadmaking. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p19.19">So good breadmaking flour is characterized as having protein which is adequate in quantity and which yields gluten which is satisfactory in respect of elasticity, strength and stability when hydrated. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p19.19">Bread dough is a plastic mass that can be moulded and shaped. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p19.19">Gluten is important in creating an extensible framework, soluble protein in the dough may also contribute to gas retention. </s>
