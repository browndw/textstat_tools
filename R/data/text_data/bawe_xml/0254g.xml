<s n="s1.9;p1.50">An experiment was conducted to investigate the performance characteristics of a single stage centrifugal pump at two different speed settings, which were 2000 RPM and 3000 RPM.

<s n="s1.7;p43.50">Figure 1 in the Appendix 2 showed the performance characteristics of the centrifugal pump. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p43.50">Firstly, the total head of the pump decreased as the discharge increased, whatever the pump frequency was 2000 RPM or 3000 RPM. The curves of the relationship between total head and discharge were identical between 2000 RPM and 3000 RPM, but the total head of 3000 RPM was much higher than the one with 2000 RPM.

<s n="s6.7;p43.50">Overall, the higher speed pump worked more efficient than lower speed pump. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p43.50">Thirdly, input power was direct proportional to the discharge for both speed settings, but the gradient of the relationship with 3000 RPM was greater than the one with 2000 RPM, it indicated that the input power increased faster with higher pump speed. </s>

<p n="p46.50">
<s n="s1.1;p46.50">Standard error propagation methods showed that measured values of suction and delivery pressure were not accurately the total pressure needed in the fundamental calculation, because there was friction in the suction and delivery valve, and dissipated energy was not considered when the suction and delivery pressure were read from pressure meters. </s>
