<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.5;p2.11">This excerpt demonstrates the symbolic use of nature and landscape to convey the social, political and scientific upheavals that occurred within Queen Victoria's extensive reign from 1837 to 1901. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.11">The proliferation of scientific material, notably Charles Darwin's <hi rend="italic">The Origin of the Species (1859),</hi> the periodic economic depression inflicted by the Corn Laws passed in 1815 that resulted in starvation and depraved living conditions as highlighted in Freidrich Engels <hi rend="italic">The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845)</hi> and the passing of the Reform Act in 1832, allowing the industrial middle class to vote, created a deep-rooted instability that was reflected in the themes covered by Victorian regional novelists. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.11">As highlighted in the above quotation, these were themes of Darwinism, class conflict, nostalgia for lost community and even divergence among the sexes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.11">By employing landscape and symbolic geography Victorian novelists were able to express these developments and changes in individuals and communities. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.11">Interestingly, each of the novelists wrote at different periods of the Victorian era, therefore I will examine Elisabeth Gaskell's portrayal of Manchester, during the 'hungry forties,' in her industrial novel <hi rend="italic">North and South (1855),</hi> the 'golden age' bucolic pastoral East Midlands of George Eliot's <hi rend="italic">Silas Marner (1861)),</hi> and explore Thomas Hardy's Wessex in <hi rend="italic">Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Woodlanders (1887.)</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.38;p3.11">First then, I will examine the novelists' use of landscape to explore the conflicts that existed between different social classes. </s>
<s n="s2.38;p3.11">As Enid Duthie highlights in the fiction of Elizabeth Gaskell "landscapes...are inseparably connected with the lives of her characters." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s3.38;p3.11">Indeed Margaret Hale embodies the unbreakable link between southern prosperity and northern misery that comprises the broader theme of class conflict in Gaskell's <hi rend="italic">North and South.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.38;p3.11">Freidrich Engels portrayal of working class Manchester filled with "the heaps of debris refuse...and standing pools for gutters [which] would make it impossible for a human being in any degree civilised to live in such a district"<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.003"/> highlights this working class misery. </s>
<s n="s5.38;p3.11">The second chapter entitled 'Roses and Thorns' is symbolic then of the social divide between the 'golden stillness'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.004"/> of Helstone and the 'purpose-like' and 'hopeless'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.005"/> streets of Milton. </s>
<s n="s6.38;p3.11">The significance of this title is emphasised at the conclusion of the novel, when Thornton shows Margaret the roses he brought from Helstone, perhaps a symbol representing the union between North and South and the social classes they embody. </s>
<s n="s7.38;p3.11">In contrast, the riot of angry mill workers who mob Thornton's home, is an obvious motion of conflict. </s>
<s n="s8.38;p3.11">Gaskell relates the 'fierce unearthly groan' they emit, filled with the 'demonic desire of some terrible wild beast for the food that is withheld from his ravening." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s9.38;p3.11">This animalistic imagery equates the mill workers with nature, thus presenting Thornton's behaviour as unnatural. </s>
<s n="s10.38;p3.11">Similarly, the mutiny that occurred upon Frederick's ship is perhaps a direct reflection of this riot between Thornton and the mill workers and Gaskell's reminder that conflict between the classes was universal, irrelevant of location or landscape. </s>
<s n="s11.38;p3.11">Certainly, Gaskell wishes to emphasise the unnaturalness of Milton due to its removal from nature. </s>
<s n="s12.38;p3.11">Margaret mistakenly concludes the screen of cloud, which she 'had taken to foretell rain' is in fact 'black, un-parlimentary, smoke." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s13.38;p3.11">This motif is explored further when Thornton abolishes the autonomy of his workers by referring to them as 'hands,' via metonymical classification and patronises them by employing the father-child metaphor, that 'masters would like their hands to be merely tall, large, children...with a blind unreasoning kind of obedience,'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.008"/> used by paternalists during the era, to define his relationship with his mill workers. </s>
<s n="s14.38;p3.11">Similar to Thornton's work ethic is Silas Marner's love of money and material possessions that symbolise the destructive nature of industrialisation. </s>
<s n="s15.38;p3.11">George Levine states that in "George Eliot's realism the details reverberate with significance and the images are as much a part of the consciousness of the characters as representations of material reality." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s16.38;p3.11">His obsession with counting money whose 'form and colour were like the satisfaction of thirst to him'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.010"/> and attachment to 'the brown pot'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.011"/> he breaks are symbolic of industrialisations consciousness of capitalism. </s>
<s n="s17.38;p3.11">Significantly, its poisoning effects are mirrored in Silas' mental degradation in the form of 'catalepsy' fits. </s>
<s n="s18.38;p3.11">Like Thornton, Silas must fight this individual desire in favour of a moral responsibility to Eppie. </s>
<s n="s19.38;p3.11">Thomas Hardy created many memorable heroines, but the most intricate of his characters was Wessex, his "partly - real, partly-dream country"<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.012"/> as he described it in the preface to <hi rend="italic">Far from the Madding Crowd (1874.)</hi> Originally a south-western region of Britain ruled by the Saxons, Hardy clearly wanted to evoke connotations of antiquity, essentially though Wessex has come to embody an entire culture that is predominately rural and pre-industrial. </s>
<s n="s20.38;p3.11">Like Margaret Hale in Eliot's <hi rend="italic">North and South,</hi> Grace in <hi rend="italic">The</hi> Woodlanders embodies the class conflict; she 'combined modern nerves with primitive feelings." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s21.38;p3.11">The cruelty of nature in which 'stoats' suck ' the blood of the rabbits'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.014"/> and 'etiolated arms of ivy...grope in vain for some support'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.015"/> reflects these conflicts. </s>
<s n="s22.38;p3.11">"Grace then is the pivotal figure, who has to choose between town civilisation and country life in choosing between Fitzpiers and Giles." <ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.016"/>Grace compares Fitzpiers presence in Little Hintock, to like finding ' a tropical plant in a hedgerow." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s23.38;p3.11">Whilst, Mr Melbury is listening to the drunken Fitzpiers criticisms of his family, the trees take on the appearance of 'sentinels...pikes...lances'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.018"/> in reflection of Mr Melbury's violent thoughts. </s>
<s n="s24.38;p3.11">These instances show that "the trees, whether viewed as subjects or as objects, are the medium through which the community lives and expresses itself." <ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.019"/>The gardens of Mrs Charmond's Hintock House, in <hi rend="italic">The Woodlanders,</hi> are essentially man-made with nature being restricted to only 'an old tree here and there'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.020"/> and 'an endless shearing of the heavy armed ivy...and a continual lopping of trees and shrubs." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.021"/>
<s n="s25.38;p3.11">Similarly, Fitzpiers' garden is 'so regular in [its] plan that they might have been laid out by a Dutch designer of the time." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.022"/>
<s n="s26.38;p3.11">These images are in direct contrast with Giles' home within the forest and symbolic of the class conflict. </s>
<s n="s27.38;p3.11">Often the theme of depicting conflict between the classes is addressed by the authors extending the boundaries of landscape into the interior landscape within the homes of individual characters. </s>
<s n="s28.38;p3.11">Margaret's aunt's residence at Harley Street that is filled with lavish fabrics of 'white muslin' and 'crimson damask sofa[s],'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.023"/> lies in stark contrast to the home of Bessy and Nicholas Higgins among 'the crowded narrow streets'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.024"/> of Milton. </s>
<s n="s29.38;p3.11">In George Eliot's <hi rend="italic">Silas Marner (1861)</hi> the Red house belonging to the Cass' is an eyesore among the traditional cottages and firmly establishes the division of classes, for when Godrey meets a local 'there was no pleasant morning greeting between them...because the sweet flower of courtesy is not a growth of such homes as the Red house." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.025"/>
<s n="s30.38;p3.11">Hardy effectively establishes correspondence between location and the quality's they denote about the types of community who inhabit them. </s>
<s n="s31.38;p3.11">Alec's home is 'a fancy farm'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.026"/> made from modern brick a 'rich red colour'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.027"/> in stark contrast to the surrounding green 'fertile and sheltered'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.028"/> land of Marlott, where Tess is from. </s>
<s n="s32.38;p3.11">Not only is his modern dwelling in conflict with the traditional homes in the Vale of Blackmoor, but it is 'built for enjoyment pure and simple'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.029"/> and it's intrusion upon the landscape signals Alec penetration of Tess. </s>
<s n="s33.38;p3.11">Sandbourne is an 'exotic' and 'fashionable watering-place,' 'a Mediterranean lounging - place on the English Channel' entirely in conflict with the surrounding countryside and symbolic of the social divide between the aristocracy and rural artisan class. </s>
<s n="s34.38;p3.11">In <hi rend="italic">The Woodlanders</hi> Mrs Charmond's living room at Hintock House is filled with 'showy Versaillese furniture,'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.030"/> 'a red-shaded lamp'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.031"/> all in a 'style unlike that of the structural parts of the building as it was possible to be." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.032"/>
<s n="s35.38;p3.11">Even the urban interloper Fitzpiers acknowledges that 'the window curtains were closed'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.033"/> because it was raining. </s>
<s n="s36.38;p3.11">Mrs Charmond is literally trying to shut herself off from nature. </s>
<s n="s37.38;p3.11">Her abode is in direct contrast to the bustling, functional home of Mr Melbury that is a higgledy assortment 'of all sorts of buildings'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.034"/> In further contrast, is the room that functions as 'kitchen, parlour, and bed chamber all in one'<ref target="BAWE_3001c-ftnote.035"/> belonging to Giles Winterborne. </s>
<s n="s38.38;p3.11">The discrepancies between the three homes only serve to embellish the divide between rich and poor. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p10.11">An admirer of J.M.W. Turner's impressionist paintings, Hardy's vast set-piece descriptions of Wessex are breathtaking in their 'painterly' detail and help evoke a sense of nostalgia for the fading rural traditions. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p11.11">In conclusion, analysis of Gaskell, Hardy and Eliot's use of symbolic geography and landscape as an analogy to explore the themes of class conflict, Darwinism, loss of community and differences between the sexes, has shown that despite the lapse of time between each of the authors work and the varied social settings, they all adopted the nature and landscape leitmotifs as a vehicle to make a wider social comment, ultimately expressing the often-conflicting demands of the individual and the community at a time of accelerating social change. </s>
