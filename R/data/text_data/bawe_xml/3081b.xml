<p n="p1.65">
<s n="s1.1;p1.65">The report aims to identify through research whether Canada is a suitable market for a British hospitality company to enter and expand its business. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.65">
<s n="s1.11;p2.65">UK based boutique hotel in the countryside was established in 1989, and is planning an expansion to Canada. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p2.65">After a successful operation in the UK the hotel was rolled out across other countries during the next 16 years. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.65">Currently is operating in five European countries and the United States. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.65">One unit runs in each European country and three units in the US; all are discretely sized properties. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p2.65">The same brand name is utilized across all countries: Finesse Boutique Hotels (FBH). </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.65">All the properties have a special identity adapted to the culture of each country while offering a unique atmosphere, charm, authenticity and calm everywhere in a beautiful scenic mountainside or countryside setting. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.65">As being such a huge success in the United States the company decided to expand and make presence in Canada, where nature is outstanding with its huge mountains and lakes. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.65">It is an interesting place for the company to explore because environmental scanning of Canada suggested that it could be an easy environment to get in, in the view of more similarities with the UK than differences. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.65">Canada is the world's second largest country, rich in natural resources. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.65">The country profile compiled by Datamonitor (2003) states: "Canadians are rightly proud of their tradition of tolerance, openness and stability", which suggests that they are a welcoming nation. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p2.65">It can be considered as an attractive market, because it is politically stable, economically very well developed, accounting for the seventh largest economy in the world (see Appendix 2 for details). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.65">
<s n="s1.4;p3.65">International marketing intends to offer a product tailored to the needs of the local customers within a global framework (Usunier and Lee, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.65">Therefore it is necessary to recognise the needs and interest of the customers one aims to offer their product to. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.65">The main characteristics of FBH are personalised, high quality service, relaxing ambience, pampering spa treatments, fine wines and fine dining, all of which created and delivered with attention to detail. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.65">Therefore the targeted segment is a specialised niche, luxury market with high education and high disposable income, health awareness and aged between 25-55. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.1 Evaluation of the Business Environment</head>
<p n="p4.65">
<s n="s1.4;p4.65">A successful company always needs to be adaptive to the changes happening in the environment it operates in (Bowie and Buttle, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.65">Both macro- and micro-environments need to be taken into consideration when evaluating business environment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.65">The macro- environment has been analysed through Political, Economical, Social, Technological and Environmental (PESTE) scanning in order to identify key similarities and differences between external environments of UK and Canada (see Appendix 2 for more details). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.65">The micro- environment has been investigated through analysing potential employees and customers as internal factors affecting marketing and direct competitors as external factors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.65">
<s n="s1.9;p5.65">For a British company the Canadian environment can be considered as easy to enter for the following reasons: both are open economies encouraging tourism, there is high business- and consumer confidence (Datamonitor Canada and UK, 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.65">Joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 enabled Canada to specialise in some profitable industries (Nations of the World, 2004) such as aeronautics or network technologies. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.65">Canada's independent foreign policy helped some firms especially in tourism sector to work on some lucrative joint venture projects in connection with the Caribbean Island (Datamonitor Canada, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.65">The macro- economic framework created in 1990s supported well Canada's economy to produce at its prospective (OECD, 2004), there were no major imbalances. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.65">The only exception was 2003 when two outbreaks of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in western Canada and forest fires and electricity blackout in Ontario affected some sectors and regions; but in general did not have a big affect on annual GDP growth according to Bank of Canada, 2003 (ibid). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.65">These disasters negatively influenced the tourism industry in Canada, while the UK was not that much affected by these happenings. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.65">There are more natural resources such as oil, natural gas and timber (Datamonitor Canada, 2003) in Canada than in the UK, which in terms of exports accounts for a great deal. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.65">Also the close trading relationship between Canada and the US cannot be ignored as it is unique. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.65">85% of total exports exit Canada for the US market (Datamonitor Canada, 2003) while US being the biggest trading partner for the UK it accounts for only 15% of total exports (Datamonitor UK, 2003). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.65">
<s n="s1.4;p6.65">From political point of view there is one major difference that needs attention, the issue of the French-speaking province of Québec in Canada who rejected "a referendum on secession from the Federation in 1995" (Euromonitor International, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.65">There is a big divide between the Francophone province and the rest of the country. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.65">Many feel their ethnicity is at risk from the huge Anglophone culture of North America. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.65">Also the east-west split influences the political culture in Canada. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.65">
<s n="s1.2;p7.65">Economically both countries are very well developed, Canada counting for seventh, the UK for the fourth largest economy in the world and future predictions are promising, too. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.65">(Appendix 2, Economical factors) </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.65">
<s n="s1.2;p8.65">From socio-cultural point of view the main difference is again the French- English internal tension in Canada. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.65">There is bilingualism in Canada (English, French) and one official language in the UK. There will be no language barriers when conducting a business in Canada which is a great advantage (Appendix 2, Social influences). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.65">
<s n="s1.3;p9.65">Technologically both countries are very advanced there is a lot of investment in new technologies in both countries (Appendix 2, Technological influences). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.65">When conducting business in a foreign country this fact is essential in terms of marketing communication possibilities. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.65">The spread use of the internet is just one possible feature to be used for successful marketing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.65">
<s n="s1.4;p10.65">From environmental point of view there are a lot more opportunities in Canada than in the UK. Canada's natural environment is outstanding with its mountains, lakes, national parks, wildlife suggesting a lot of opportunities for tourism (Appendix 2, Environmental influences). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.65">As sport and health tourism are among the most popular ones nowadays these are supportive factors however the increasing popularity of 'new' destinations such as South- America, Central America and the Caribbean cannot be ignored. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.65">There is a future forecast by World Tourism Organization (1999) that there will be the lowest growth in tourism arrivals in the North- American part, while the highest growth is expected in Southern America until the year of 2020. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.65">While Canada is an attractive environment there is a big marketing challenge for Canadian hospitality industries to remain at the top. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">2.2 Demand</head>
<p n="p11.65">
<s n="s1.3;p11.65">There is a need for analysing the demand for travel and tourism in the destination country before deciding whether to enter the foreign market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.65">Drivers of each type of hospitality demand apply to all countries for travel and tourism according to Middleton and Clarke (2001) which need to be constantly monitored by marketing managers in order to gain competitiveness. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.65">The same external factors of market demand influence all hospitality industries, the difference in success lies in the way they respond to these determinants. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.65">
<s n="s1.4;p12.65">Looking at international arrivals, American visitors are far the biggest sector for Canada (Loverseed, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.65">There is an interesting growth from year 2001 to 2002 which might be surprising after the 11 September terrorist attack, however it can be explained that many US tourists cancelled their overseas holiday plans choosing Canada instead as 'safe' place and alike to their home. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.65">There is a decrease (Appendix 3) in US travellers according to the previous year, which might be associated with Canada's choice not to participate in the Iraqi conflict, SARS outbreak (ibid). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.65">Nevertheless the table below shows that US is still the largest inbound market to Canada. </s>

<p n="p13.65">
<s n="s1.4;p13.65">After the US international demand comes from the UK and France. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.65">For Europeans Canada is an attractive destination as the prices related to tourism such as food and lodgings are comparatively lower than in their home countries, thus Canada is a 'good value for money' (Loverseed, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.65">Travel and Tourism Intelligence research also suggests that domestic and international business demand comes from Vancouver where a large convention and meetings clientele exists. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.65">Advantages of business customers are that bookings are arranged very much in advance and cancellations are rare, whereas domestic leisure consumers are more likely to change their minds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.65">
<s n="s1.4;p14.65">Economic factors influence the volume of demand (Middleton and Clarke, 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.65">Looking at annual disposable income in Canada and tourist expenditures in 2003, both show growth comparing with the previous year which suggest 'income elasticity' (Appendix 4 and 5). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.65">There was a slight fall back in expenditure in 2001 and 2002 but the following year it has risen again. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.65">International tourism receipts decreased in 2003 (Appendix 4), mainly due to SARS outbreak however this affected domestic tourism in a positive way. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.65">
<s n="s1.5;p15.65">Inflation in Canada is very low and has remained between the range of 1 to 3 per cent since 1991, which was established by the Bank of Canada and the Government as a target and is predicted till the end of 2006 when it will be reviewed again (OECD, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.65">Exchange rates are very in favour of Canada, there was a currency appreciation in 2002-2003. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.65">"Sharp and rapid appreciation of Canadian dollar weighed on demand." </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.65">(Euromonitor International, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.65">Low interest rates sustained domestic demand and personal consumption rose by 4.3% in 2003, while there were not very large wage increases. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.65">
<s n="s1.2;p16.65">Future outlook is very positive, though there is a risk to be considered which the rise in oil prices is. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.65">Although Canada would benefit from higher export income it would bring down the demand from the US and would put downward pressure on Canadian exports, but this is impossible to predict with accuracy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.65">
<s n="s1.3;p17.65">Demographic data suggest the average household in Canada consists of 2 persons which is typical of developed economies (Middleton, 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.65">In the last decade more detailed segmentation and niche marketing have been introduced in order to get a better picture about consumer needs. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.65">Especially in the luxury market sector, there are people with high income but probably with different interest coming from different business backgrounds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.65">
<s n="s1.3;p18.65">Geographic factors are becoming more and more influencing on travelling decisions. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.65">As WTO suggests that tourist are becoming more interested in activity inclusive vacations rather than classical sightseeing (World Tourism Organization, 1999). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.65">The climate, diverse nature and scenic appeal of Canada are definitely attractive for future visitors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.65">
<s n="s1.5;p19.65">From socio-cultural point of view holidays are believed to be a necessity rather than a luxury and this applies to Canada. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.65">Growth in earlier discussed disposable income, short working hours a week (average working week in Canada in 2003 was 32,5 hours according to International Labour Organisation), personal mobility enables people to travel more and more often (Euromonitor International, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.65">Tourist arrivals by road are the highest in terms of method of transport (Appendix 6). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.65">National Parks though in Canada have their regulations for entrance by private car. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.65">Sustainability is a concern taken care of in Canada. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.65">
<s n="s1.3;p20.65">Influence of the media and the information technology are another factors influencing demand. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.65">In Canada 33.6% of households make travel arrangements through the World Wide Web (Appendix 7), which is going to increase in the future. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.65">Governmental regulations on eco-tourism are very effective in Canada in order to protect the nature and the wildlife. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.65">
<s n="s1.1;p21.65">People in luxury segment are looking for something inspirational, satisfying their special interest. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.3 Supply Factors in Canada</head>
<p n="p22.65">
<s n="s1.1;p22.65">When entering a foreign market there will be presence of existing hospitality companies and the competition needs to be examined. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.65">
<s n="s1.4;p23.65">Porter (1980) recognised that understanding and analysing competitors helps to convey the best from a company. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.65">He identified 'five competitive forces' that drive industry competition: '<hi rend="italic">bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products or services, intensity of rivalry among existing firms.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.65">A combined strength of these forces establishes probable revenue for the industry. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.65">Suppliers and rivalry among existing competitors is being looked at in more detail. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.65">
<s n="s1.8;p24.65">Main issues in bargaining power of suppliers from hospitality prospective are the workforce and labour relations from marketing manager point of view. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p24.65">Ronen and Shenkar's figure (1985 cited in Bowie, 2005) of country clusters shows that Canada belonging to the "Anglo" Country Cluster as well as the UK and US will make it easier to work there. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p24.65">Canada having one of the official languages English there are no language barriers. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p24.65">On the other hand there might be issues with the question of skilled staff, as to be able to deliver high-standard service. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p24.65">In the luxury market sector skilled, dedicated personnel is essential to perform at their best ensuring customer satisfaction. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p24.65">While unemployment remains relatively high: in 2002 "more than 500,000 new jobs were created", principally in the services segment. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p24.65">The 99% literacy in Canada (Datamonitor Canada, 2003) shows sophistication. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p24.65">A large number of highly skilled employees at FBH will probably take away a great part of the company's profit. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.65">
<s n="s1.8;p25.65">According to Porter's (1980) five forces model 'intensity of competitive rivalry' needs to be analysed, in case of FBH number and type of competitors. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p25.65">As targeting a niche market segment both domestic and international competition need to be looked at. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p25.65">Thorough research of the author indicated that there are a large number of boutique hotels in Canada. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p25.65">Due to space limitation the ones big large number of rooms is being ignored, only the 'smaller' ones are being looked at. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p25.65">However research suggests that in North America there is a different understanding of 'small' than in Europe. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p25.65">Key competitor hotel brands identified are the 13 Relais &amp; Chateaux hotels and restaurants across Canada, from which the Post Hotel and Spa in Lake Louise, Alberta have been chosen to be analysed; and other small boutique hotels in the area such as: Whistler Pinnacle, Sundial Boutique Hotel and Pan Pacific Whistler Village Centre. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p25.65">There is the Lumière Restaurant which however is not a hotel but cannot be ignored because of its Relais Gourmand title, a top restaurant in town of Vancouver being unique in the area (Appendix 10). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p25.65">These hotels all target a niche market sector. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.4 Market Attractiveness</head>
<p n="p26.65">
<s n="s1.4;p26.65">Canada attracts both small and large companies from any part of the world (Osland <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.65">, 2001) and has one of the world's most open economies for foreign investment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.65">Dynamically encourages non-Canadians to commence a new business activity or expand their existing one by setting up small number of restrictions and regulations (Government, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.65">Federal requirement is to file a notification within 30 days of the implementation with Investment Canada. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.65">
<s n="s1.6;p27.65">Selecting an entry mode is one of the most central strategic decisions an intercultural company has to make (Root, 1994 cited in Osland <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.6;p27.65">, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p27.65">Implementing the appropriate mode of entry may help to achieve competitive advantage. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p27.65">Firm specific internal and location specific external factors need to be considered (Hollensen, 2004) when looking for the right method of entry strategy. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p27.65">Internal factors in case of FBH are as follows: a relatively small hotel with small number of bedrooms, with international experience in five countries in Europe and the United States, high economies of scale, using global reservation system, need for investment in training. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p27.65">External factors suggest a politically stable country with business confidence, high level of economic development, not much cultural distance from the home country. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.65">
<s n="s1.4;p28.65">However climate change cannot be ignored when evaluating market attractiveness. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.65">The outstanding natural environment in Canada with its scenic mountains and lakes, national parks are all determining attractiveness for tourism and are a critical factor when defining a quality tourism product according to HLA Consultants &amp; ARA Consulting Group in 1995 (Hall and Higham, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.65">The loss of these natural settings out coming from climate change could have a great deal of negative implications on Canadian tourism in the Rocky Mountain and the Great Lakes area as well. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.65">The tourism industry must be adaptive to climate change and should work together with scientists in order to develop a sustainable tourism program. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.65">
<s n="s1.4;p29.65">Hollensen (2004) ranks the entry modes in export-, intermediate- and hierarchical groups. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.65">Export modes are indirect or direct exporting, or export marketing groups; which are typical choices when entering a foreign market for the first time and supplying from the domestic set. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p35.65">It is a narrow niche market looking for perfection. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.65">
<s n="s1.6;p36.65">Niche markets such as spa are emerging in Canada (Loverseed, 2005) and they are targeted by smaller competitors, who are proposing original and appealing packages to attract specific interest travellers. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p36.65">Golf and cruises are behind the spa tourism. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p36.65">The spa usage is more likely to be linked with holiday taking as it is supposed be a stress relieving, fitness and health activity for both genders rather than beauty treatments or weight loss for only women as it used to be in the past (Travel and Tourism Analyst, 1998). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p36.65">Health consciousness of highly educated consumers creates a demand for health tourism in a relaxing and beautiful area offering nutritious and gourmet meal at the same time. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p36.65">Targeting a niche market who is not interested in mass destinations where 'sun-sea-sand' desires are fulfilled but looking for something more personalised and meaningful in order to learn about themselves and their lives. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p36.65">Enjoying a relaxing holiday treat while remaining healthy, keeping fit and young-looking in a beautiful scenic setting of mountains. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p39.65">This is a perfectly acceptable route when looking after people from UK in Canada, which could be a possible approach adopted by FBH as it has been seen from statistics earlier that UK visitors are the second largest inbound market in Canada. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.65">
<s n="s1.2;p40.65">The poly-centric orientation focuses on the host market, tailoring their marketing to the needs of local customers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p40.65">There is a great domestic demand in Canada but considering that there are no fundamental differences between the UK and Canada as seen from the PESTE analysis of the Canadian environment perhaps this approach would not be the best to follow. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.65">
<s n="s1.2;p41.65">The regio-centric direction concentrates on the regional demand, consumers from the US in this case. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p41.65">FBH could possibly follow this approach as US demand is the greatest in the host country. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.65">
<s n="s1.3;p42.65">Finally the geo-centric orientation addresses the global market, having an affirmative mind-set towards any culture in the world and implementing the best management techniques from many different countries. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.65">Though there is a great regional, host- and home market demand in Canada FBH targets a narrow, niche Anglo- American market. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p42.65">The similar values are recognised rather than the country of origin. </s>
</p>

<s n="s1.4;p52.65">Secondly the 'product' element of the marketing mix is being discussed. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p52.65">According to Usunier and Lee (2005) it is an essential matter to decide whether to standardise or adapt products when planning international marketing strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p52.65">A large number of firms offer a standardised "core" product and adapt if necessary. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p52.65">Within the product there is a range of characteristics that might need different level of standardisation or adaptation according to different customer routine in various cultures. </s>
</p>
<p n="p53.65">
<s n="s1.4;p53.65">However there is a very strong argument against this from Levitt (1983) who believes that there is no need to differentiate in little details that might come out from various cultures. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p55.65">Physical attributes such as size and facilities need to be standardised, on the other hand design should be adapted to the host country as the 30 individually decorated rooms are created by two famous Canadian designers. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p55.65">Each room will have its own name and fragrance according to the style and atmosphere it will offer. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p55.65">At the same time this will apply to the lounge areas and the Champagne Bar, the two main dining rooms and one private dining room. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p55.65">Leisure facilities offering spa treatments shall be standardised in terms of quality but adapted to local needs and potentials. </s>

<p n="p57.65">
<s n="s1.4;p57.65">Symbolic attributes are normally explaining physical attributes. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p57.65">The size of the hotel, the colours used in décor, the name of the brand and logo all represent a meaning. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p57.65">Though this can be understood in different ways by various cultures in case of FBH this would not apply. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p57.65">Symbolic attributes should be standardised. </s>

</p>
<p n="p60.65">
<s n="s1.5;p60.65">Ransley and Ingram (2001) believe that a valuable design can catch the attention of the targeted market segment and makes it possible for the hotel to set the prices consequently. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p60.65">This theory applies to FBH as all the suites, restaurants and lounges are individually designed by professionals creating a special value and lifestyle is one of the main characteristics of the brand. </s>
