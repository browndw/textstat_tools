<s n="s1.9;p1.10">This essay will analyse the extent to which current Western understandings of Asia are informed by Orientalist assumptions. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.10">In order to address the question appropriately, it is, of course, necessary first to define the term Orientalism and therefore give a brief description of the expression and its origins. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.10">William D. Hart summarizes Orientalism as 'a Western style of domination and authority, through which the Orient is restructured'.<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.001"/> A noticeable change in Orientalism is from where ideas have tended to generate. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.10">Initially, France and Britain were at the forefront of the movement but since World War II, America has led the way. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.10">However, perceptions are still based on Oriental assumptions. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.10">Films, television and modern media have reinforced Oriental ideas, while there are very few literary references to Orientals leading to a dehumanized perception of Orientals. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.10">Finally, the influence of American culture may have even intensified Orientalism. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.10">One could even argue that the Orient is Orientalizing itself! </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.10">The essay will, therefore, come to the conclusion that popular Western understandings of Asia are still almost exclusively framed within the narrow parameters of the ideas of Orientalism. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p2.10">An Orientalist was the term designed by Edward Said to describe someone with a scholarly knowledge of the Orient. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.10">The Orient was a European invention and covered an area including the Middle East and Asia. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.10">The fact that this vast geographical mass was lumped together under one broad title shows the racism inherent in the term itself. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.10">Orientalism originated in India and the Orientalists came from a conservative tradition spanning from the 1770s to the 1820s. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.10">Orientalism was used by Said to explain the Western understanding of the East. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.10">It was 'a way of coming to terms with the Orient that is based on the Orient's special place in European Western experience'.<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.002"/> In general, according to Said, the Western scholars wrote about the Orient in negative terms. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p3.10">There was a general feeling of intellectual authority over the Orient within Western culture. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.10">A feature of European-Oriental relations was that Europe always seemed to be in a position of strength. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.10">For Said, 'Western domination of the non-Western world [was] not some arbitrary phenomenon but a conscious and purposive process governed by the will and intention of individuals as well as by institutional imperatives." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s4.9;p3.10">The Orientals themselves were also portrayed in a negative light. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.10">They were seen as irrational, depraved, childlike, and 'different' and the European as rational, virtuous, mature, 'normal'. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.10">Embedded in the understanding of Orientalism was a definite sense of the 'Self' and the 'Other': 'For Orientalism was ultimately a political vision of reality whose structure promoted the difference between the familiar (Europe, the West, "us") and the strange (the Orient, the East, "them")." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s7.9;p3.10">Hart argues that Orientalism is 'the quintessential Western representation of otherness, the constitutive other of the West, that without which there would be no West'.<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.006"/> The Orient was seen as undeveloped and inferior compared to the superior, rational and developed West. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.10">To summarize, therefore, in Said's own words, 'Orientalism is the generic term that I have been employing to describe the Western approach to the Orient; Orientalism is the discipline by which the Orient was (and is) approached systematically, as a topic of learning, discovery and practice." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s9.9;p3.10">However, this discipline was inherently racist and portrayed the Orient as backward and consequently in need of civilisation whilst also justifying the West's domination over the East. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p4.10">Now that the expression Orientalism has been defined, it is thus possible to examine the extent to which Western understandings of Asia are still informed by Orientalist assumptions. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.10">One of the major changes in the West's portrayal of the East is from where the assumptions are generated. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.10">Previously, Orientalism was dominated by French and British perceptions of the East due to their sprawling global Empires. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.10">However, since World War II, America has gained in significance on the world geopolitical stage and has therefore taken the lead in developing Orientalism: 'France and Britain no longer occupy center stage in world politics; the American imperium has displaced them." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s5.8;p4.10">A consequence of this has been a shift away from Orientals in India and China towards a greater focus on the Arabs of the Middle East. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.10">Indeed, 'Since World War II, and more noticeably after each of the Arab-Israeli wars, the Arab Muslim has become a figure in American popular culture." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s7.8;p4.10">Said even states that the Arab has been transformed from a faintly outlined stereotype to an accepted caricature. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.10">This is extremely relevant considering the recent Danish cartoons depicting Arabs as suicide bombers. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.10">Another difference with American Orientalism was that the Arabs were depicted as 'Semitic'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.10">They were presented as having sharply hooked noses with evil leers on their faces. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.10">There was a transfer of anti-Semitism from the Jew onto the Arab. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.10">This was done smoothly since the figure was essentially the same. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.10">The Arab was seen as an obstacle to Israel's creation in 1948. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.10">
<s n="s1.11;p6.10">The change in focus of depiction, however, does not affect the fact that the perception of the Arabs is still based on Oriental assumptions: 'These contemporary Orientalist attitudes flood the press and the popular mind. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p6.10">Arabs, for example, are thought of as camel-riding, terroristic, hook-nosed, venal lechers whose undeserved wealth is an affront to real civilisation." </s>

<s n="s3.11;p6.10">This can be seen with the current issue regarding the increased oil and gas prices. </s>

<s n="s7.11;p6.10">The West feels impotent in relation to the price increases that the Arab states have implemented which it feels are completely unnecessary. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p6.10">In fact, in this particular case, the Arab states are merely following Western ideology: capitalism. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p6.10">A shortage, or perceived shortage, of oil and gas has led to a greater demand, which in turn has led to higher prices. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p6.10">The West cannot bear the thought of Orientals making huge profits at their expense, which they see as unjustified. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p6.10">The idea of the greedy Arab milking the West was first born after the 1973 war where Arabs were depicted 'standing behind a gasoline pump turned up consistently.' <ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.012"/> </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0029e-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s4.15;p7.10">Orientals are commonly presented as more sinister in modern times rather than just helpless as was the case in the past. </s>
