<s n="s1.10;p1.29">Changes in the structure and features of woodland are dynamic both in spatial and temporal scale. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.29">In terms of the span of an event in woodland there is great variation, dominant trees may live up to 300 or 500 years while significant changes may occur within a very short period of time. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.29">For instance, a storm may level stand trees in a large area within an hour, but the successive reformation of woodland would take several decades after such a disturbance. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.29">Gap formation and regeneration may continuously take place in an interval of a few decades. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.29">On the other hand, field and ground layer vegetation which is comprised of various annual and perennial grasses, herbs and shrubs have much shorter life cycle (Kirby and Morecroft, 2000). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.29">Due to such a variety of effects on woodland process most of which last longer than the duration of experiment, monitoring on site is often impractical. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.29">Therefore, prediction on the changes of woodland structure is very difficult. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.29">This is particularly problematic when dealing with the changes in field and ground layer vegetation which are strongly influenced by the growth of other layer vegetations and the environment. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.29">One useful tool for this purpose is a simulation model. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.29">This report summarises the attempt to construct a model which demonstrates changes in woodland structure over time with an attention to the understory vegetation cover and factors affecting the rate of increase on the filed and ground layer vegetation in order to take account of those factors in planning of woodland management. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.29">In response to the increasing interest on the creation of new woodland or restoration of abandoned woodland for recreational and educational purposes as well as for biomass or timber production, the features of field and ground layer vegetation has become to be considered as an important point in planning and management. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.29">For recreational purposes, the provision of diverse forest floor annual or perennial plants where visitors can enjoy the view in woodland is a valuable characteristic of the new woodland. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.29">From practitioners' point of view, there is a need to provide quantitative model to assess how the understory vegetation changes over time in such woodland. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.29">One important question is how the understory vegetation cover would be affected by the canopy closure and opening. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.29">Due to the difficulty in assessing the complex abiotic and biotic effects on the colonisation of understory vegetation, and in the generalisation of findings, and the fact that there is limited amount of work carried out in such multi-purpose woodland, there is no qualitative or quantitative model which provides such information. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.29">The aim of the construction of a model demonstrated here is to suggest a simplified example to answer this question using Stella package based on various information available to date. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p4.29">The environment of the herbaceous understory vegetation is modified by the dominants in the plant community, i.e. canopy layer trees which change the amount of radiation penetrated through to the filed and ground layer and affect the proportion of intercepting precipitation (Fedeer and Tanner, 1966). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.29">Although there is a great difficulty in investigating the relative importance and correlation of those factors on the growth of understory vegetation primarily due to technical problems in measuring on site and complexity of those factors which interact easch other (Anderson <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1968), there are several studies which investigated the effects of each factor. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.29">According to Shirely (1945), development of understory vegetation is greatly suppressed under limited light intensity of less than 4% of full sunlight. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.29">This finding was supported by another study which demonstrated that the increasing light intensity leads to the changes in the shoot to root ratio of plants, the allocation of biomass is inclined to shoots in order to increase the level of light interception (Blackman and Wilson, 1951). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.29">In terms of precipitation, general recognition is that two mechanisms are involved in affecting the understory vegetation. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.29">Firstly, the interception of precipitation by the canopy layer and the surface litter limits the total amount of precipitation available to the understory vegetation. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.29">Secondly, competition over moisture which penetrate to the forest floor between canopy layer trees and understory vegetation. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.29">Throughfall precipitation which is defined as the proportion of the precipitation faling directly through holes in the canopy to the forest floor (Voigot, 1960) is one of important components in the total amount of precipitation and moisture available to understory vegetation (Anderson <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1968). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.29">
<s n="s1.8;p5.29">Based on such findings, Anderson <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1968) investigated how herbaceous understory vegetation cover respond to canopy cover, light intensity, and throughfall precipitation in coniferous natural forest and relative importance of those factors in relation to the significance of effects on understory vegetation cover. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.29">Three factors are revealed as important factors in regulating the environment of the field and ground layer, thus the understory vegetation cover. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.29">Firstly, the canopy openness: changes in understory vegetation cover were proportional to canopy openness as expressed in % canopy opening relative to the completely opened condition without trees. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.29">Secondly, modification of light and throughfall precipitation by the canopy layer: the correlation between light and understory vegetation cover was significant, with an increase in light intensity, undersotry vegetation cover increased. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.29">The same pattern of response was found in the case of throughfall precipitation. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.29">Thirdly, environmental factors: one suggestion was moisture content of the upper soil layer which seemed to have effects on the distribution of roots of understory vegetation, however, the importance of such factor was suggested to be less than that of the other two factors. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.29">This early study demonstrated that canopy openness, light intensity and throughfall precipitation as major factors which have control over the understory vegetation cover, suggesting the throughfall precipitation as the most important. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.29">Although such study has not been given much attention in recent years, study by Thomas <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1999) which examined the effects of thinning and fertiliser addition on the understory vegetation also support that the significance of those factors in regulating the growth of understory vegetation. </s>
