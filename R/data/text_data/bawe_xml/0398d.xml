<s n="s1.3;p34.35">Companies are increasingly acceptant of the Combined Code and the Code of Best Practice. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.35">This acceptance, coupled with the willingness of institutional investors to control management, means that there is no need for prescriptive and inflexible laws. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.35">As institutional investors continue to increasingly adapt to their role, monitoring and pressure on the board will increase, and better corporate governance practices will result. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p35.35">It is vital to avoid the repetition of past damaging financial scandals. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p35.35">Should the current system fail to sufficiently regulate excessive managements, legal regulation should be considered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p35.35">Meanwhile, the system should be subjected to continued review and institutional shareholders and the market itself should be encouraged to participate as much as possible. </s>
