<s n="s2.3;p1.17">It was a week since I had cleared my end of year examinations and now I was literally half a world away from revision and examination stress. </s>

<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.5;p2.17">Cairo is a city at once confrontational and yet evasive. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.17">It is home to 16, 18 or 20 million depending on whom you talk to.<ref target="BAWE_0065g-endnote.001"/> But all agree that it is an all-out assault on the senses. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.17">On arrival the city will either seduce or repel. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.17">I was of the former persuasion and could not wait to explore this noisy, chaotic, vast and unpredictable location. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.17">The doors to Cairo airport split open in a mechanized mitosis and I was greeted by the <hi rend="italic">khamseen</hi>, a dry and very dusty wind storm which blows in from the parched Western Desert at up to 150kph (93mph). </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.17">Taxis are cheap and provide an excellent means of exploring the city, which covers 214 sq. kilometers. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.17">There are five millennia of history to see in a city that guards its secrets well. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.17">Historic buildings are buried in age-old quarters of the city and everywhere is teeming with humanity; the corpuscles that give this ancient body life. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.17">The high population density and limited space can feel oppressive especially when the summer heat begins to rise beyond 30Â°C. On hot days it is a blessing to be near the river Nile and to be cooled by the breeze that floats across its shimmering surface. </s>

</p>
<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.3;p5.17">There were many things that surprised me at the ICU. I had not anticipated that all the ward rounds would be conducted in staccato-paced Arabic. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.17">Although the Egyptian doctors studied medicine in English they did not have much opportunity to practice conversational English. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.17">I had to spend two or three hours every night studying Arabic but by the end of the first fortnight I was able to take a basic history in Arabic. </s>

<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.4;p6.17">Some of the senior house officers very kindly offered to show me around their city. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.17">In an effort to combine medicine and sightseeing they would ask me two questions at the start of every journey; "Where do you want to go?" and "What do you want to learn?" </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.17">I had a tutorial about orthopaedic surgery in the shadow of the sphinxes paw. </s>
