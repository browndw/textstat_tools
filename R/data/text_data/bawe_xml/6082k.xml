<s n="s1.1;p19.24">According to the methodology and apparatus used, there are both a fairly high degree of accuracy (with difference of results within ± 0.05cm <hi rend="sup">3</hi>) and minor sources of errors, lead to an anomalous result: </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.24">
<s n="s1.4;p20.24">The main source of error is probably the personal judgement (with naked eyes) of end point, which is when the solution in the conical flask changes colour from colourless to the first permanent pale pink as the flask is swirled. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.24">It is always difficult to be able to control the run down of NaOH. It usually ends up with varied pale pink densities. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.24">On the other hand, it is much more accurate also to measure the absorbance of solution using a photospectrometer at an appropriate wavelength. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.24">It is expected that the higher the absorbance value the higher the pink intensity, thus a positive correlation. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p21.24">C <hi rend="sub">8</hi>H <hi rend="sub">5</hi>O <hi rend="sub">4</hi>K is a stable and non-hygroscopic chemical which is easy to store. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.24">It can be readily made up as a standard solution, the primary standard. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.24">It has a relatively high molar mass, thus to reduce weighing error, which has also been reduced by using an accurate four-decimal-place electronic scale in weighing. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.24">However, the low water solubility of C <hi rend="sub">8</hi>H <hi rend="sub">5</hi>O <hi rend="sub">4</hi>K requires (p.1 Methods - step 3) breaking and grinding manually that are likely to be uneven. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.24">This can be improved by using powder C <hi rend="sub">8</hi>H <hi rend="sub">5</hi>O <hi rend="sub">4</hi>K in order to demonstrate a fairer test and to obtain more reliable and valid results. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p22.24">It is good to have rinsed the weighing boat, stirring rod and the funnel after each transfer, and then the washings were added to the flask. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p23.24">It is important to keep the consistency: either to add two or three drops of indicator in every titration. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.24">A new dry conical flask should be used for each titration, to avoid incompletely cleaned and dry ones, thus to affect the results. </s>
