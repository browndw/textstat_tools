<s n="s1.3;p1.21">The latter half of last century saw some of the most significant developments in international criminal law. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.21">With the establishment of two <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> international criminal tribunals in former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR), the so-called 'internationalized-courts' in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Kosovo and the permanent International Criminal Court (ICC), momentous steps have been taken to implement mechanisms, operating at an international level, to punish those responsible for the commission of the gravest breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.21">As a result, we have witnessed the emergence of what has been heralded as a <hi rend="italic">"new culture of accountability"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069d-ftnote.001"/>, replacing the previous <hi rend="italic">"culture of impunity"</hi>

<s n="s2.3;p2.21">The aforementioned <hi rend="italic">"culture of impunity"</hi> had persisted throughout history for good reason; primarily, due to the unwillingness of states to sacrifice their treasured sovereignty over the <hi rend="italic">"hallowed area of criminal law"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0069d-ftnote.003"/> for fear of being subjected to international scrutiny. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.21">Such philosophy has by no means been ousted among all nations, and as we shall see, it still serves as a critical restriction on the efficacy of international criminal law, as its enforcement is so evidently dependant on the co-operation of states, on their political will and their readiness to limit their sovereignty and submit to international jurisdiction. </s>
