<head rend="bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p3.64">
<s n="s1.6;p3.64">Ants come under the category of hymenoptera and they are one of the groups within this order that are eusocial, ants belong to the family Formicidae, but because there are so many species of ant (9,000 worldwide) 10 subfamilies have been created (Dorling 2001). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.64">The colonies are structured with a queen ant which is the only Female to mate; the fact that she is the only one to mate means the queen is the only one that can produce a female. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.64">The male in the colony can be produced by an unfertilised egg so any female with ovaries in the colony can produce a son by Parthenogensis (Sudd and Franks 1987 as cited from Myrmica;Smeeton, 1981). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.64">However most females in the colony are infertile and without ovaries this is because it is the females in an ant colony that are the worker ants, so they are produced infertile. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.64">Reproduction in an ant is determined by the ant's diet, a rich diet will ensure the ant becomes reproductive, and reproduction is only carried out by the queens and males in the colony (Dorling 2001). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.64">The queen will remain in the nest while the worker ants will go out and forage for food and raise the young. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.64">
<s n="s1.5;p4.64">For the structure of the ant community to be maintained it requires the ants to be able to pass information between them. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.64">The ants' method of communication relies on pheromones which can be used to produce the 'colony odour' which allows nest mates to identify each other, this pheromone dwells in the cuticles of adult ants and is not present in young ants, the pheromones that are not linked to 'colony odour' are secreted from specialised exocrine glands. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.64">Another pheromone is the alarm pheromones which cause the ants to attack any foreign being that enters their colony. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.64">The other types of pheromone used are recruitment pheromones which help in obtaining recourses and sexual pheromones used in mating. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.64">It was Holldobler (1978 as cited in Sudd &amp; Franks 1987) that placed the types of pheromones into these categories. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.64">
<s n="s1.4;p5.64">Within a community there is a verity of jobs that need to be done, the jobs are delectated by age, and this process is based on a polyethism system (Sudd and Frank 1987). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.64">The youngest worker ants remain in the nest were it is safe and perform duties such as tending to the queen, maintaining the nest and taking care of the brood. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.64">Foraging duties are given to old worker ants because this work contains more hazards and these ants are near the end of their life. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.64">It is these old worker ants that this study looks at, for they are what leave the nest. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.64">
<s n="s1.2;p6.64">This study was carried out at Rennes field centre in Paimpont, France. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.64">The study looked at the community structure of ants in different habitats, since the worker ant is the only ones to leave the nest it was the structure of worker ants that was looked at. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.64">
<s n="s1.2;p7.64">To be able to address how different habitats affect the structure of ant's community a site was needed that contained a wide rang of habitats. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.64">The area this study was conducted in was 15m by 18m and was on a very gentle slope that sloped downwards (fig1). </s>

<p n="p58.64">
<s n="s1.14;p58.64">Research has been done on the types of interactions that accrued between ants, the interactions have been categorised into groups depending on how much the two species interacted. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p58.64">The groups ranged from cohabitation with no interaction to a complete association between a parasite and the host colony (Lenoir etl 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.14;p58.64">The ants that fall between these two extreams of interaction are the thief ants, which only interact when the thief ant steals pupae or the forage from another worker ant of a different species. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p58.64">
<hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> tends to be a victim of <hi rend="italic">Solenopsis</hi> <hi rend="italic">fugax</hi> which raids the nests of <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca (Sudd + Franks 1987).</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.14;p58.64">Another ant that steals pupae from <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> is <hi rend="italic"> Polyergus rufescens</hi> (Sudd 1967), however none of these two raiding ants were found on our site. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p58.64">The results gathered from our site showed <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> to have a relationship with <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi>, the chi squared test showed that <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi> benefited from each other, this is seen in the fact that you have a higher amount of them together than expected. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p58.64">Nether of the two species of ant have ever been recorded as acting as parasite or host ant to the other species. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p58.64">So this suggest another reason for the association, <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi> has been recorded to form temporary mixed colonies in the summer, this fusion of unrelated ants can accurse due to the shortage of nesting site (Lenoir etl 2001). </s>
<s n="s9.14;p58.64">However in this study a nest was found for both species of ant, the fact that both species of ant now have their own nest dose not rule out the possibility that earlier in the year the two species of ant did coexist as one colony put makes this hypothesis unlikely. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p58.64">The other possibility is that <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi> once was a large colony that split into two leaving one colony without a queen ant, so for this community of ants to survive they needed a queen ant, so formed a mixed colony with <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> (Lenoir etl 2001). </s>
<s n="s11.14;p58.64">This behaviour from <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax Nylanderi</hi> has been recorded before, if you look at fig 26 you can see around the nest site of <hi rend="italic">Formica</hi> <hi rend="italic">fusca</hi> there is quite a few <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax Nylanderi</hi> species present. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p58.64">The behaviour of the ants was recorded in this study as well and none of the ants around this nest were acting acresavle to each other. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p58.64">The two different species of ants would have different 'colony odours', so the <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> ant should have secret an alarm pheromone and attack the <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax Nylanderi.</hi> </s>
<s n="s14.14;p58.64">The evidence from this study suggests that these two species of ant are reliant upon one another for their communities to survive, and it is quite likely they have formed a mixed colony to allow the survival of both colonies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p59.64">
<s n="s1.11;p59.64">The results also show <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax Nylanderi</hi> to have a relationship with <hi rend="italic">Tetramorium Caespitum,</hi> though the reason for this interaction appears to be a different reason to that of the reaction between <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax Nylanderi</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Formica fusc.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.11;p59.64">
<hi rend="italic">Teramorium Caespitum</hi> has been recorded as beening a host ant to Anergates atratulus only when the colony of Teramorium Caespitum is without a queen ant (J.H.Sudd + N.R.Franks 1987). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p59.64">
<hi rend="italic">Teramorium Caespitum</hi> has also been recorded as having a range of ants which are parasitic off them. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p59.64">However the site of our study dose not contain the parasitic ants, instead it shows an interaction between two species of ant that apparently benefits from each others presents. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p59.64">Neither of these two species has been recorded as acting as a host to the opposite species or as an ant that raids the others colony for pupa. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p59.64">The reason for the interaction between these two species is highly speculative, the study shows no evidence to suggest any reason for there interaction, and there appears to be no records of these two species interacting. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p59.64">The two species could be beneficial to each other by providing each other with protection from predators, if they share the same predator its more likely that at least one ant from one species will spot the predator. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p59.64">H.A Gleason hypothesis as to why different species would interact is because they require similar abiotic factors (Cited from Campbell, Reece &amp; Mitchell 1987). </s>
<s n="s9.11;p59.64">However F.E Clements came up with an interactive hypothesis that is the community is linked by biotic interactions without these links a community cannot function as a unit (Cited from Campbell etl 1987). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p59.64">Whether these two species of ant are interacting due to biotic or abiotic factors cannot be determined from this study. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p59.64">The reason for the interaction between them cannot be determined from this study only speculations can be made, for a more accurate reason for the interaction between the two species they would have to be observed in more depth. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Tetramorium Caespitum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Formica fusca</hi> where found to have a chi <hi rend="sup">2</hi> of 1.79430 which is lower than one degree of freedom (3.84), this means there presents in one area has no effect on the other species. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p60.64">There is no association or dissociation between these two species, the location of these two species is random and not influenced by the other species. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p60.64">The nest is located at the edge of the site, then if you look at the location of each species found on site (fig 26) it shows <hi rend="italic">formica pratensis</hi> is only located in the A column, this suggest that <hi rend="italic">formica pratensis</hi> forages to the side of the site and only has its nest within the site. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p60.64">This shows an interesting structure to <hi rend="italic">Formica pratensis</hi> worker ants, there worker ants only forage in one direction from there nest, which takes them off the study site. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p60.64">If you look at the location of Leptothorax Nylanderi nest you can see they use a different structure for there foraging techniques, instead of just foraging in one direction from the nest they forage all round the nest, this can be seen in fig 26. </s>

<p n="p61.64">
<s n="s1.4;p61.64">Another aspect looked at in this study was whether the time of day effected the presents of ants. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p61.64">The start of the day when it was cool and still damp resulted in very few ants of any species being present, by the time morning had warmed up more ants are about, by mid day the majority of ants are out. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p61.64">In the evening the nest for <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> was discovered and ants were located around the nest but other than that no ants were found in the evenings. </s>

<p n="p62.64">
<s n="s1.11;p62.64">The temperature is not the only aspect to affect the amount of ants present in an area, the type of habitat present also effect the location of the ants. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p62.64">
<hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi> seem to have a slightly preference to a lower amount of coverage (see fig 8). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p62.64">There is only a slight difference between the amount of ants located in the 50% regain and the 90% reign. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p62.64">However there are a few more ants located between 10% cover and 50% cover than between 50% and 100% coverage. </s>

<s n="s6.11;p62.64">
<hi rend="italic">Tetramorium Caespitum</hi> is another ant that prefers the lower percentage covering to the high percentage covering, (this is shown in fig 14 and 15). </s>

<hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> on the other hand was found mainly in the 50% to 100% coverage (fig 20); however fig 21 shows the high percentage patches to have more of <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> absent, suggesting it's not a preferred coverage. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p62.64">The reason for this may be due to or site containing a high proportion of high coverage areas and only a few <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca.</hi> </s>
<s n="s9.11;p62.64">
<hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi and Tetramorium Caespitum</hi> are never found in an area without any cover, a reason for this may be because they are to exposed to predators. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi and Tetramorium Caespitum</hi> also avoid the high coverage patches, if they are in the high coverage patches it's to shaded for them, they like warm conditions, so the go for an intermediate between being exposed or being to cold and go for mid coverage. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p63.64">The structure of the ant communities found on site varied slightly from species to species. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p63.64">The structure of the communities were partly effected by the surrounding habitats, for habitat influences the location the ants are most likely to be found in, for example a <hi rend="italic">Tetramorium Caespitum</hi> colony is most likely to be found in an area with 30 to 50 percent cover. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p63.64">However it is not just the habitat that affects the structure of an ant community, the abiotic factors also influence the way the colony is structured. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p63.64">All the species of ants in this study preferred warm dry conditions, worker ants only go out to forage in dry warm weather, on a wet day the structure of the colony changes, foraging is replaced with another task. </s>

<p n="p64.64">
<s n="s1.7;p64.64">The biotic factors also contribute to the structure of the community. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p64.64">The majority of the ants found on this site had some kind of effect on another species of ant, though this study can only draw speculation as to why different species of ants are interacting, it dose appear that on this site <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi> are reliant upon one another. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p64.64">Should <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> disappear from the site then the community structure of <hi rend="italic">Leptothorax nylanderi</hi> would fall apart for it is likely this colony is dependent on <hi rend="italic">Formica fusca</hi> queen. </s>
