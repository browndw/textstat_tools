<s n="s4.9;p1.14">The two major conceptual ideas which form the normative basis and ultimate goal of all strands of Liberalism, (the identification of which can be supported by John Gray<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.002"/>, Kant<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.003"/> and Keohane<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.004"/> - see footnotes), can be summarised as follows: 1. </s>

<s n="s6.9;p1.14">2. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.14">The emphasis on individual rights and freedoms as a means by which improvability can progress. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.14">However, as with all theories of International Relations, normative goals require a method of implementation. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.14">For Liberals, this implementation is based on the major conceptual idea of working within the present contextual and structural framework of International Relations in order to promote reform. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.14">A common criticism of Liberalism hinges on the view that Liberalism's emphasis on individual rights and freedoms is a conceptual idea which cannot be universally applied to all cultures and corners of the world. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.14">For example, the incompatibility of Confucianism and Liberalism has been highlighted by political leaders in East Asia who believe that "confrontation, individualism and moral decay...characterises Western Liberalism"<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.14">Tim Dunne describes the main challenge of Liberalism: to "preserve the traditional liberal value of human solidarity without undermining cultural diversity." </s>

<s n="s4.8;p6.14">Furthermore, evidence of the universal respect for the individual can be found everyday across the globe. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.14">For example, families, individuals and locally based NGOs, operating in states which do not formally recognise the rights of individuals, work to ensure that the members of their community are provided with the education, healthcare and support they require in order to live. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.14">This respect for individuals is arguably due to what might be described as a common feeling of humanity. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p8.14">Firstly, the very fact that Liberals theorise the realisation of their goals within the boundaries of the existing structures and conceptual frameworks of International Relations, means that the progress they make will always be historically contextual. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.14">For example, the construction of the UN was born out of the desire to prevent another world war: "The United Nations was established...as a result of initiatives taken by the governments of the states which had led the war against Germany and Japan.... </s>

<s n="s4.5;p8.14">The historical context of the UN is therefore specific to those countries between which World War Two was fought and because the grip of colonisation on the developing world had only begun to weaken, most developing states which are now members of the UN had little or no input into the workings or aims of the institution. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.14">Furthermore, the aim of the UN to prevent international conflict through the cooperation of nation-states is arguably becoming increasingly more redundant as the majority of ongoing conflicts in the world today are civil wars - for which the UN, based as it is on a structure comprising of nation-states, can provide little help in reconciliation or settlement. </s>

<p n="p9.14">
<s n="s1.4;p9.14">Secondly, the political structures of international institutions like the UN are based on those of the Liberal democracies of the states which founded them. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.14">The result is that the hierarchical structure and the over-riding discourse can leave such institutions less open to the political procedures of non-liberal democracies. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.14">Balakrishnan Rajagopal provides an example of this in relation to the underestimated importance of social movements of the developing world: "lawyers tend to have a juro-centric approach... </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.14">Lastly, from a wider perspective, the need for institution and law can be seen to result from the constraints of capitalism as the dominant force of our time. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.14">Due to an insistence on operating within the existent boundaries of International Relations, where those with the means and ownership of production are constantly seeking to sustain their position, Liberals are forced to use the accepted methods of progress and change, whereby it is at risk of becoming a "doctrine of the status quo"<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.14">These methods of institution and law fail to identify and challenge the true causes of the arguably, worsening conditions of human life around the world and lack of meliorism, which can be directly linked to the inequality and injustice inherent in capitalism. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p11.14">There is no doubt that the effects of capitalism in its present form and the pursuit of profit do little to help or promote the ultimate goals of Liberals. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p12.14">Firstly, it can be argued that capitalism at present relies on institutions and powers which are in fact supported or were created by Liberals. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p12.14">This poses significant restraints on the abilities of Liberals to tackle the evils of capitalism without in fact contradicting their own achievements and methods. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p12.14">For example, the relationship between the democratic state and the success and influence of multinational corporations has been highlighted as an essential element of capitalism in our time. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p12.14">Most democratic states consist of party systems where the political parties have moved ever-increasingly towards each other. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p12.14">In terms of policy, they differ only in minor details resulting in a constraint, not only on what is discussed but on what even occurs to people to discuss. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p12.14">This can be seen to facilitate the progress of capitalism in a number of ways: from the maintenance of a docile and unquestioning public to the prevention of issues such as 'the right not to work' from finding a place on the political agenda. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p12.14">Another example is the hospitable environment of low taxation and low labour costs which states provide for multinational corporations as highlighted by Joseph Stiglitz<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p12.14">As responsible to and representative of their citizens, democratic governments feel obliged to attract corporations in order to promote overall economic growth and higher employment at the cost of workers' wages and in many cases, the environment. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p12.14">While this relationship between capitalism and democratic states clearly contributes to the prevention of the realisation of Liberal goals, it is impossible for Liberals to attack the relationship without attacking the Liberal achievements of representative democracy. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p13.14">A second, related limit of Liberalism in relation to capitalism hinges on the weakness of Liberals in recognising the ever-changing and dynamic nature of capitalism. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p13.14">There is evidence to suggest that in the past Liberals have been successful in diluting or even preventing some of the damaging effects of capitalism on human life. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p13.14">For example, monopoly capitalism was held back by the Monopoly Commission or Anti-Trust Laws. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p13.14">However, the implications of global capitalism suggest that companies have found ways of creating monopolies through the use of Liberal institutions and laws such as the Patent Office and also by circumventing the nation-state and the principle of free trade. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p13.14">Again the problem here is related to Liberal boundaries of analysis which recognise non-state actors in the international system, but insist that the emphasis should be placed on states as actors. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p13.14">This is partly due to the reason highlighted above, that democratic, federal states have representative legitimacy due to Liberal historical success, (see footnote<ref target="BAWE_0135h-ftnote.017"/>), but also because, as described in the first half of this essay: for Liberals the most effective means by which improvement in the lives of humans can be achieved is through the use of institution and law. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p13.14">The result of this approach is that other non-state actors, non-democratic states, as well as the potential power of unstructured human compassion and resistance, does not form part of the Liberal method of implementation. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p13.14">Yet due to the limiting effects of the relationship between capitalism and the nation-state, these alternative actors may provide the most progressive way of attaining Liberal goals. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p14.14">To conclude, through an analysis of the limits created by the boundaries imposed by Liberals on their possible methods of progress, this essay has argued that there is a conflicting relationship between the two aspects of Liberal major conceptual ideas about international relations. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p14.14">However, through a consideration of the historical implications of the methods of liberalism, this essay has highlighted the contradictions which result from an approach to progress which fails to question or attack the structural framework in which it operates. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.14">Arguably, the need for the Liberal goals of improvability is in fact structural to the whole system, and by working within the system, improvements are limited and perhaps, ultimately, impossible. </s>
