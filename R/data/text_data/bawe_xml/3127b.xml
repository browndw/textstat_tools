<head>Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.53">
<s n="s1.4;p1.53">This paper presents an analysis of two texts which have been chosen as interesting from a pedagogical view. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.53">The present IELTS exam requires that candidates write either a formal or an informal letter. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.53">By comparing and analysing the texts it should be possible to identify a prototypical letter and how choices realised in the texts achieve their goals. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.53">As Eggins (2004) states, this kind of contrastive analysis is useful because patterns of choice are more easily identified. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.53">
<s n="s1.5;p2.53">Genre and Register theory can enable the linguist to both predict and deduce the likely meanings and linguistic features which are 'at risk' in a text. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.53">Genres are realised through structural patterns, or stages whereas the different contexts manifest in the variables of Register. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.53">This paper will therefore analyse the texts' schematic structure to highlight how closely they conform to the genre and use Register theory to focus on how the writers convey underlying meaning. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.53">Finally the texts are analysed from a pragmatic viewpoint to see to what extent maxims of politeness are followed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.53">The paper concludes with the implications for teaching exam students. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head>Genre</head>
<p n="p3.53">
<s n="s1.9;p3.53">If we can determine what the social or communicative purpose of a text is, we should also be able to identify its genre. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.53">(Martin 2001; Eggins and Martin 1997 pp236-237; Eggins, 2004; Bhatia, 1993). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.53">The social purpose of text B is interactional - a term normally used to refer to spoken discourse to describe the maintaining of social relations. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.53">Text A on the other hand is transactional, the purpose is to inform and request someone to do something. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.53">Although Swales (1990) refers to the overarching category of 'letters' as a 'multigeneric generalisation', when the purpose is identifiable they can be viewed as a specific genre. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.53">Thus from a top-down approach we can say that both texts belong to a multigeneric form of <hi rend="italic">correspondence,</hi> though they belong to different specific genres of a) Letters of Complaint and b) Rejection or 'Dear John' Letters. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.53">It seems likely that the first genre 'a' occurs more commonly in formal letters as in text A, whilst in text B a rejection of a friendship must logically be informal. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.53">Paltridge categorises formal and personal letters as two genres, interestingly, he cites research as showing that the same genre can differ greatly in its linguistic patterns' and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.53">(Biber cited in Paltridge, 1996. p237-239) </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.53">
<s n="s1.6;p4.53">Fairclough (2003) suggests that social transformations change genres and that this change is manifested as a difference in the combination of genres. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.53">One social change of the last 50 or so years has been the advent of computer technology use within organisations. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.53">Formerly, correspondence or communication was generally a one to one interaction between business and client; today much of the administration and logging of correspondence is often complicated by elaborate networks. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.53">From email to outsourced customer services, the potential for lost communications is much greater thus possibly giving rise to a new genre, of which text A is an example. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.53">This genre (which inevitably forms a <hi rend="italic">genre chain</hi>) could be categorized as Correspondence Complaining About Miscommunication. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.53">An example of the <hi rend="italic">genre chain</hi> of text A might be: </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.53">
<s n="s1.1;p5.53">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_3127b-form.001"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.53">
<s n="s1.1;p6.53">whereas such a chain is not likely for text B. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.53">
<s n="s1.7;p7.53">One reason the two texts are identifiable is that they conform to the schematic structure of their genre, although more so in certain stages than others. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.53">Painter (2001) states that: "the purpose of a genre determines its shape (...) </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.53">Thus the structure is not so much an arbitrary prescriptive formula as a facilitating convention." </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.53">Genres are facilitating because in using and recognising the genre (or the purpose) the reader is freed from the burden of repeatedly creating and understanding new patterns of layout, stages and language (Eggins, 2004). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.53">This conformity to a generic type allows us to predict features. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.53">In any correspondence one would expect to see a specific layout and functional stages such as Opening, Closing. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.53">Furthermore in complaint letters one would expect such stages including: </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.53">
<s n="s1.1;p8.53">Situating (including background information), Statement of Problem possibly embedded in reason for correspondence, optional Further Explanation of the problem and/or the background information and optional Request. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.53">
<s n="s1.1;p9.53">It seems that the first two stages could come in either order though Situating is likely to be first, unless the problem is embedded in the reason for writing. </s>

<p n="p13.53">
<s n="s1.7;p13.53">There appears to be a degree of instability in genre definition and classification (Bhatia, 1993; Fairclough, 2003; Paltridge, 1996), however it seems clear the texts differ enough in their communicative purpose to be separate genres. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.53">There are a few stages which are common to both and seem obligatory for the category of letter and some for the genre of <hi rend="italic">Complaint letter</hi> irrespective of register. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p13.53">The first is that of layout; the position of each part of the initial referencing stage is specific and can be mapped onto a cline of degree of flexibility wherein the recipient's name in left position is inflexible, but the date, or addresses depending on formality, might be located on the left or right or missing. </s>

<s n="s9.9;p41.53">Not only could an accusation be libellous, but it would also fail to convey the deliberate flouting of the <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> maxim to produce hyperbole and thus ridicule. </s>

<p n="p42.53">
<s n="s1.4;p42.53">Lines 7i. to 9 are <hi rend="italic">direct speech acts</hi>; the loctuionary and illocutionary force are the same (to apportion blame) and thus defined <hi rend="italic">declarative</hi> (Searle) or <hi rend="italic">performative</hi> (Austin). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p42.53">The perlocutionary force or effect on the reader would be to understand they are being blamed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p42.53">Even though the maxim of quality is flouted with 'good'; using a positive adjective with a negative meaning is sarcasm, the purpose of which might be to ridicule/ embarrass/express contempt. </s>

<p n="p43.53">
<s n="s1.2;p43.53">Line 12i. is by its very nature an <hi rend="italic">on record, bald, without redressive action</hi> FTA. It is both a positive and negative FTA; it is imposing an action on the reader and it is also an indirect ('if') suggestion of incompetence. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p43.53">Although no maxims seem to be obviously flouted in line 15, by referring to the implicature already generated in the letter (incompetence), the writer effects sarcasm with lexis ('usual procedures') normally used to imply efficiency. </s>

<p n="p44.53">
<s n="s1.4;p44.53">Overall, there are 9 FTA's, 4 of which are <hi rend="italic">bald</hi>. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p44.53">As this correspondence is only the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> in the chain, it seems unusually lacking in politeness strategies. </s>

<p n="p45.53">
<s n="s1.10;p45.53">In contrast, text B contains 1 main, 'painful' positive-face threatening act, but also many politeness strategies. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p45.53">Patricia judges the risk of her FTA to be so 'weighty', that she must begin with (line 3) a positive politeness strategy: "I'm sorry". </s>
<s n="s3.10;p45.53">According to Leech's maxims (1983) this could be viewed as a <hi rend="italic">Modesty</hi> maxim, in which the speaker 'maximises dispraise of self' or that of S <hi rend="italic">ympathy</hi> where the speaker maximises sympathy for other. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p45.53">"The Modesty Maxim [is exemplified intrinsically in] apologies". (ibid p132) </s>
<s n="s5.10;p45.53">Another expression which realises this goal is: "I'm afraid' (line 3i). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p45.53">Both phrases are formulaic which brings into question whether Patricia really means it. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p45.53">According to Searle a sincerity condition for an apology is that the speaker "should truly regret it" (cited in Brown and Levinson, 1987). </s>
<s n="s8.10;p45.53">However Cameron (2001) suggests that if the recipient takes it as a real apology it is irrelevant whether it is sincere or not. </s>

<p n="p46.53">
<s n="s1.7;p46.53">Distancing theory, first proposed within psychology, states that the bearer of bad news will in some way distance themselves from the recipient. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p46.53">In replies to job applicants this manifests as "more words before the rejection and fewer words before an acceptance." </s>
<s n="s3.7;p46.53">(Ahmed and Bigelow). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p46.53">With text B this is not the case, perhaps because Patricia sees a need to deal with the phone conversation first. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p46.53">This does follow research showing that most personal letters start with a reference to the most recent contact with the other person" (Mahmoud, 2001). </s>

<s n="s1.5;p47.53">Strangely the FTA itself (3ii) is done baldly with no redressive action. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p47.53">In fact the opposite, it is emphasised. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p47.53">By possibly flouting the maxim of quantity (there is no locutionary need to add 'simply' and 'obviously') she generates the implicature that Juliet demands too much (as above). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p47.53">The purpose is to provide justification to Patricia's indirect directive (that Juliet no longer regard her as a friend). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p47.53">Lines 4 to 5 could be seen as both providing justification for Patricia but also as redressive action in the form of <hi rend="italic">positive politeness</hi> assuring Juliet that there are other reasons for the FTA. In referring to 'fine novels' Patricia again ministers to Juliet's positive face; by identifying shared likes she recognises her as an in-group member. </s>

<p n="p49.53">
<s n="s1.4;p49.53">The analyses reveal to what degree these authentic texts conform to their genre type in both structure and formality. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p49.53">Additionally, we see how the flouting of conversational maxims, use of politeness strategies and lexico-grammatical choices achieve the writer's purpose and reflect their attitudes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p49.53">With regard to exam students we need to consider which of these aspects it is useful for them to be aware of and to what degree. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p49.53">The answer depends on the exam tasks. </s>

<p n="p51.53">
<s n="s1.6;p51.53">It is interesting to note the degree of similarity there is to the genre analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p51.53">Evidently a student does not need to know the layout conventions or openings. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p51.53">Although much of the structural organization has been given, some awareness of and practice in the schema structure including closings would be very useful. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p51.53">As there is such a close correspondence of both structure and content (complaint), it would be interesting and useful for students to analyse authentic letters (Burns, 1990). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p51.53">Using discovery techniques and instruction, formulaic phrases could be highlighted. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p51.53">Such as those above for politeness strategies (I'm afraid) or introducing topics, ('I'm writing about..') </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.53">
<s n="s1.4;p52.53">Both formal and informal letters could be used to help students identify aspects of register and predict the register used from the given context. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p52.53">However, taking the analysed texts as examples of different registers, we see that there is no clear divide of formality. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p52.53">Therefore students need to be aware of the <hi rend="bold">cline</hi> that exists and could be helped by mapping phrases/lexis onto it. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p52.53">The more awareness they have in this the better; as Painter says (2001), the tenor dimension is extremely difficult for students to 'navigate'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p53.53">
<s n="s1.4;p53.53">Despite claims that textbook material is inadequate and does not reflect real language (Badovi-Harlig et al.), in this case it seems that because the exam task is realistic, so is the exam teaching material. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p53.53">Any backwash created by the exam could have useful applications in the real world. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p53.53">To sum up, an analysis such as this is a constructive pedagogic tool to sensitise educators; however it is doubtful that students need to be aware of, for example, FTA's. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p53.53">From insights gained, a teacher should therefore be mindful of what <hi rend="bold">will</hi> be useful such as: exponents of functions, or notions of politeness (providing an explanation for a rejection), and restrict themselves to teaching these. </s>
