<s n="s1.3;p4.10">On the valley plateau, mature heather occurred on gravels. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Potomageton</hi> occurred in such pools, and it was uncertain as to whether the pool vegetation was M29 (<hi rend="italic">Hypericum elodes</hi>-<hi rend="italic">Potamogeton</hi> <hi rend="italic">polygonifolius</hi> soakway) or M30 (related vegetation of seasonally-inundated habitats Hydrocotylo-Baldellion) due to poor descriptions. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.10">Unfortunately, for each region there was not a minimum of five quadrats sampled. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.10">However, the results produced show a series of transition zones along an ecotone. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.10">This was especially apparent at the top of the slope, where H2 community occurred but with new species, not described in the NVC. There may be scope to divide H2 into sub communities, i.e. with or without <hi rend="italic">Pteridium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Molinia</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.10">Certain communities were not described in great detail, leading to difficulties in aligning them to NVC communities, e.g. whether pools of water at the bottom of the valley slope were classified as M29 or M30. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.10">M29 is apparently not present in the south east of Britain, and distribution of M30 is not really stated. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.10">As an incidental note, although not sampled, W4 (<hi rend="italic">Betula</hi>-<hi rend="italic">Molinia</hi> woodland) appeared to occur along the centre of the valley floor. </s>

<p n="p10.10">
<s n="s1.3;p10.10">The data shows a typical zonation around a lowland valley bog in southern England, as described by Rodwell <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.10">(1991) in M21a section. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.10">Such ecolines comprise transitional communities, which are at times problematic to key out to NVC. </s>
