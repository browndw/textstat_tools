<p n="p1.10">
<s n="s1.3;p1.10">The sign of any outstanding and lasting design is its recognition. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.10">One of the most easily recognised designs of the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century is the Coca-Cola bottle, which almost anyone would recognise regardless of age, nationality or gender. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.10">I will now look at the origins of this design and consider why it is so successful. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.4;p2.10">When Coca-Cola first started bottling their drinks they used a simple rounded bottle of equal radius throughout, known as the Hutchison Bottle, as was common with beverages of the time (left). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.10">Its stopper worked either by using a marble or a stiff wire look and a rubber disk, whereby the pressure inside the bottle forced the disk or marble right to the top of the bottle where it acted as a seal and its own pressure prevented it form leaking (right). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.10">It could be released by pushing the marble down or twisting the wire and letting the pressure out. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.10">However, they found that this bottle and its sealing mechanism were inefficient, costly and liable to leak and break. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0354d-pic.002"/>
<p n="p3.10">
<s n="s1.2;p3.10">Coca-Cola then realized the importance of shape in their bottle designs: they realized that a consumer, on reaching into a bucket of ice, would not be able to tell the Coca-Cola bottle from any other bottle just by touch, and so would grab whichever bottle came to hand first. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.10">It was clear that Coca-Cola had to make their bottle a distinctive shape if it was to be recognized and selected out over other bottles. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.3;p4.10">It is then that the initial idea for the Coca-Cola bottle as we know it today first appeared. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.10">The original design was based on the cocoa pod (left) from which Coca-Cola is made which was both distinctive and easy to hold. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.10">The resulted in what was called the Root Bottle (right). </s>

<s n="s1.1;p5.10">b/p </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.10">
<s n="s1.2;p6.10">This design of bottle was the true beginning of Coca-Cola's success: it was distinctive, unusual, modern and it spread throughout the world very fast. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.10">The increased use of the crown cap (as is commonly seen on almost all bottled beers and soft drinks still today) made transportation of Coca-Cola's bottles easier too. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354d-pic.004"/>
<p n="p7.10">
<s n="s1.2;p7.10">However, the bulky shape of Coca-Cola's bottles still hampered transportation a little; the Hutchison bottle was well equipped for traveling as many bottles could be fitted in a box without much wasted space. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.10">Coca-Cola therefore decided to slim down their bottles to the shape we see them today: </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354d-pic.005"/>
<p n="p8.10">
<s n="s1.2;p8.10">This shape of bottle is thinner and so many of them can be packed together in a smaller space, but it still maintains the unique shape derived from the cocoa pod that was its inspiration. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.10">There are possibly other points that make this improved bottle shape more appealing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.10">
<s n="s1.2;p9.10">One positive aspect of a thinner bottle is possibly its similarities to the female form: it is curvaceous and yet slim, which epitomises the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century desirable shape of women. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.10">The bottle has both a "neck" and a "waist", and although this may seem to be a somewhat specious comparison, it does represent a great deal about Coca-Cola and their image of up-to-the-minute fashion and desirability. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0354d-pic.006"/>
<p n="p10.10">
<s n="s1.4;p10.10">Due to the distinctive design of the Coca-Cola bottle, it has been available for advertising itself merely as distinctive. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.10">It has resulted in a whole troop of collectors worldwide, and itself has become a collector's item. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.10">It is possible to buy Gold Plated, solid silver, chocolate, giant and miniature Coca-Cola bottles, and the bottle itself has largely spawned the overall popularity of the drink and the recognition of the Coca-Cola logo which can be seen throughout the world. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.10">It is a fine example of what clever aesthetic designing can do for a product, and interesting to see how the design of possibly the most famous item and logo throughout the world has come into being. </s>
