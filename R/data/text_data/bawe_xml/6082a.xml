<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s1.2;p17.19">As the <hi rend="underlined">objective lens</hi> is responsible for resolution (as well as magnification), the <hi rend="underlined">numerical aperture (N.A.)</hi> of the lens is directly related to the resolution. </s>
