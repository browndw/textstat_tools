<p n="p1.36">
<s n="s1.5;p1.36">1838 is a crucial date in the history of Guyana as on the 1 August, the emancipation of Africans and creoles who had been working in sugar plantations was finally carried through and protected by law. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.36">In order to preserve the status quo between 1834 and 1838, creoles were still bound to plantations through apprenticeship, which in many ways was similar to the conditions they had worked and lived in as slaves. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.36">This created great tensions between creoles and the colonial elites and as soon as the blacks were freed from their bondage, most sought to escape the plantation system permanently. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.36">Some became peasant and tenant farmers, and those who were lucky were finally able to rise through the social ranks. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.36">For example, they moved into the retail sector, become artisans and merchants; some even became white collar workers such as lawyers and doctors and a very few were able to gain considerable wealth and aspired to become as esteemed as the traditional white colonial elites. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.36">
<s n="s1.10;p2.36">However, despite this fresh fiscal activity, Guyana remained profoundly reliant on sugar plantations to fuel the majority of her economy. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.36">This meant that even before emancipation, plantation owners began to search for other sources of labour. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.36">The solution presented itself in the form of immigration from India, China and Portugal. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.36">The reasons these people had for immigrating varied from economic hardship to religious or political persecution. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.36">A majority of these immigrants (particularly the darker skinned Chinese and the Indians) filled the roles of the ex-slaves as indentured servants on the plantations. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.36">Largely, this meant that they experienced similar living and working conditions to the ex-slaves. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.36">Yet, generally, the Portuguese remained outside the plantation economy, preferring to focus their efforts on retail trade. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.36">Crucially, the colonial elites allowed the Portuguese to work outside the plantations due to their European background and their white skin. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.36">Elites placed them nearer the top of the 'racial and cultural stratification'<ref target="BAWE_0280j-ftnote.001"/> whereas non-white immigrants, were more desirable for plantation work due to the prejudices of white colonial elites in Guyana putting non-white immigrants as the lower end of the social spectrum. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.36">Essentially the cultural elites in Guyana sought to compel other cultures to conform to their cultural traditions and accept their view of racial superiority according to skin colour. </s>

<p n="p3.36">
<s n="s1.4;p3.36">When in Guyana, immigrants realized that their traditional religious practices, living arrangements, their language and nearly every part of their normal day lives would be challenged by a variety of influences and pressures from other cultures present within Guyana. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.36">Importantly, the majority of immigrants envisaged their stay in Guyana as a temporary affair which would last only as long as it would take to amass a fortune with which to return to their home country. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.36">Immigrant cultures, therefore, generally sought to preserve their traditional cultures as opposed to the creoles who had already accepted their place in Guyana as permanent. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.36">Consequently, Creoles often sought to mimic the cultural elites in order to increase their social mobility, whereas the immigrants generally attempted to resist the pressures of the elites in order to maintain their cultural heritage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.36">
<s n="s1.6;p4.36">The degree to which different racial groups would be affected would vary from person to person and group to group. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.36">For example, the Portuguese attempted to live as a closed social group and cut off as much outside contact as possible. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.36">However, as their primary trade was retail, they did experience cultural pressures from those they conducted business with. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.36">Both the Indians and the Chinese were forced to live in cramped and unhygienic plantation accommodation once reserved for the slaves, under the constant cultural restrictions and pressures emanating from elites and local creoles. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.36">It was in these conditions that immigrants attempted to preserve their cultural identity. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.36">In order to ascertain how far immigrant cultures were affected by other racial groups, it most helpful to examine how far their traditions changed (or if they were able to preserve them intact) under different pressures in several areas of life in Guyana. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.36">
<s n="s1.5;p5.36">One of the most concerning challenges that immigrants had to face when they arrived in Guyana was the maintenance of traditional family structures. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.36">This is due to an acute shortage of females who boarded the labour ships bound for Guyana. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.36">'From the outset it proved extremely difficult to get Indian women to emigrate." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0280j-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s4.5;p5.36">For example, the number of Indian females who arrived from 1880 to 1889 was 7,494 compared with the arrival of 16,408 males in the same period. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.36">However, the shortage of women was most evident among the Chinese as Brian L. Moore demonstrates: </s>

<s n="s1.8;p6.36">This shortage meant that the Chinese population would remain largely insignificant in Guyana, and might even have been threatened with extinction. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.36">This had the effect of increasing the freedom of choice of partner for female immigrants. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.36">It also encouraged them to accept partners from other cultures. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.36">This represented a simple but significant departure from Chinese tradition, as in contemporary China, women rarely chose their partner. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.36">K. O. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.36">Lawrence claims that the shortage of female Indian immigrants was due to the fact that many were locked in pre-arranged marriages as part of an old Indian tradition. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.36">However, Brian L. Moore suspects both the Chinese and Indians believed that if their womenfolk were to immigrate to Guyana, they would be reduced to prostitution. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p6.36">In addition, as the majority of Indian wives of men in their early twenties were in their teenage years, families felt that it was undesirable to risk young girl's lives by allowing them to travel to Guyana. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.36">
<s n="s1.6;p7.36">Interestingly, the altered situation of the Indian immigrants in Guyana meant that traditional Indian marriages and even traditional patriarchal relationships were considerably adjusted. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.36">However, Brian Moore states that 'the Indian immigrants strongly resisted elite pressures to conform to the Anglo-Creole model of the male-female relationship." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0280j-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s3.6;p7.36">Instead, restrictions imposed on women through religious ideology, social institutions and ideas that were strongly rooted in Indian society itself were eroded in Guyana, allowing women freedoms that are commonplace in modern western society. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.36">Firstly, Women found personal security and increased appeal to males as plantation workers earning their own wage in their own right, another important break from traditional practice. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.36">Secondly, in addition to their newfound independence, the short number of women meant they increasingly found they could choose between suitors as men competed to marry the few women present in Guyana. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.36">Thus, arranged marriage, a staunch tradition that was central in Indian culture was reduced in Guyana. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p8.36">Crucially, 'heathen marriages' were discouraged by colonial authorities who ruled that any children born under traditional Indian marriages were considered to be illegitimate and could not legally inherit property.<ref target="BAWE_0280j-ftnote.005"/> This may be seen as a fundamental restriction on an Indian cultural activity that was an important part of their cultural identity; Indian marriages are a proud and joyous event with great amounts of money spent on them. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.36">Thereafter, legal or traditionally binding marriages were seen as practical in Guyana as wives increasingly left their husbands for, more prosperous men. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.36">In addition, women in Guyana tended to regard cross-race marriage far less controversially. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.36">Mary Ilandun, for example, had a colourful career, changing partners eight times, moving from Guyana to Barbados to Trinidad before finally returning to her original husband before his death, after which she received half of his estate.<ref target="BAWE_0280j-ftnote.006"/> This was seen as such a serious problem by the colonial authorities that they felt it necessary to alter their immigration policy as Malcolm Cross shows: </s>

<s n="s1.4;p9.36">The fact that the colonial authorities intervened clearly demonstrates how far some women pushed the boundaries within the reduced restrictions of a traditional Indian society which would normally keep such callous women in check. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.36">However, as a result of increased infidelity, crimes of passion (murdering a cheating wife for example) which were ingrained in Indian 'religio-cultural' tradition, increased to compensate. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.36">The laws of Manu sanctioned the punishment of adultery by death and these were upheld in Guyana just as they were in India. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p10.36">Significantly, the Portuguese population did not experience such severe shortages of female immigrants. </s>

<p n="p12.36">
<s n="s1.2;p12.36">The existence of interactions between other cultures in Guyana joined with the shortage of women in both the Chinese and the Indian populations caused significant cultural changes to take place. </s>

<s n="s8.8;p32.36">Religious festivals continued to be a starkly apparent challenge to the cultural dominance of the colonial elites and thus were a symbol of cultural resistance and of independent Chinese, Portuguese and Indian identity. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p33.36">It was inevitable that all immigrant cultures would experience some form of cultural change by moving to another country, no matter how capable equipped they were to resist transitions. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p33.36">For example, the Portuguese became successful enough not only to one of the first cultures to step into the gold and diamond industries but also 'Portuguese prospectors and merchants were able to unite with middle-class blacks and coloureds in a campaign for constitutional reform." </s>

<s n="s6.10;p33.36">They maintained a diet very similar to that found in Madeira, they kept their education within their own ranks and preserved the same family and social structure. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p33.36">Their success was built around separate ethnic institutions (which other cultures had but to a lesser degree) which served to separate them from the rest of society. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p34.36">However, limits on the number of female immigrants had considerable affects on the traditional power of males over their choice of partner; it allowed rolls of choosing a mate often to be reversed. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p34.36">In addition, although importantly they refused to speak Creolese or English, preventing complete cultural infiltration of their language, they were forced to fuse several different variations of the Indian language to form a practical language that could be spoken by all of the Indian community. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p34.36">This process of homogenization was also necessary to unify religious practise and celebration in Guyana. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p34.36">This signified a loss of a great amount of cultural diversity within their community. </s>

<s n="s5.8;p36.36">It is clear that by the nineteenth century in Guyana, immigrant communities had not changed enough for there to be a completely homogenized society as there were still sharp distinctions between each community. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p36.36">However, immigrant communities were affected significantly enough to claim that Guyana did not experience a pluralized society by the end of the nineteenth century. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p36.36">Instead one may claim that only in the next century when immigrants and creole began forcing their way into government in ample numbers that cultural assimilation and a more unified value consensus would develop on a larger scale. </s>
