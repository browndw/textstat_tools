<s n="s1.6;p1.47">Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk or, Total Work of Art, is usually explained at the simplest level as his view to recreate the combined expressive elements of ancient drama in order to conceive the artwork of the future. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.47">Total Art would contain all those elements apparent in Ancient Greek drama - those of dance, costume, drama and music framed in the event of a festival. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.47">Wagner's view was that, since the Renaissance, art had lost this quality and music drama had become debased. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p1.47">In dramatic art, the highest level of poetry had been achieved (by Shakespeare) as had music's ultimate expression (in Beethoven). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.47">It was necessary therefore, to combine these two forms to create a new Music Drama. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.47">
<s n="s1.1;p2.47">However, a closer description of the Total Work of Art would be to say that it is not merely an art form combining all the arts but one which combines Wagner's many talents. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.47">It is difficult to imagine how frustrating it must have been for Wagner, that even after he had created the Festpielhaus at Bayreuth, a theatre supposedly containing all those elements necessary to realise the Gesamtkunstwerk, the staging of his work failed to meet the demands of his emotional capacity. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p6.47">I will explore the relationship between the music and the libretto and how the three pieces, despite appearing in completely different parts of the score, connect together musically. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.47">
<s n="s1.3;p7.47">Two things interest me when listening to a Prelude or Overture. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.47">The first is how an opening piece of music acts as an anticipation of all that is to happen throughout the score. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.47">This is usually achieved by the composing of a Prelude after the rest of the work has been completed, </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.47">
<s n="s1.4;p8.47">What is interesting about the Prelude to <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> is that Wagner had not even begun to work on the remainder of the opera when he completed the opening. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.47">Discovering this makes the Prelude more interesting to listen to because it raises the questions of how Wagner composed a piece which so perfectly creates the moods of 'endless yearning, longing, the bliss and wretchedness of love...a languishing forever renewing itself...death, surcease, a sleep without waking', (which were a few of Wagner's own words to describe the story of <hi rend="italic">Tristan)</hi>, before the three acts of the opera had been realised. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.47">It is somewhat disconcerting too, that the themes within the Prelude, which have come to be known as separate 'motives', were probably not thought of in the same terms by Wagner when he composed it. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.47">For example, the motives labelled by listeners as the 'Sorrow' motive or the 'Magic' motive, may not even have been written with a view to evoke these moods in the minds of the audience. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.47">
<s n="s1.2;p9.47">The first time I listened to the Prelude, I had already heard other parts of the opera, so a few of the motives were familiar. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.47">I would have been able to recognise the Prelude as a piece of music from <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.47">
<s n="s1.2;p10.47">The appearance of the motives used in the opening makes it more logical to listen to in terms of its role as the 'Prelude'. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.47">It ties the opera together before it has even begun. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.47">
<s n="s1.4;p11.47">There are two motives evident in the opening bars - the first, often named the 'Sorrow' motive, is played on cellos. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.47">The second 'Desire' motive extends from the first like an echo, played quietly by the oboe. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.47">Once these motives have been named, the meanings in the music become clearer. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.47">The first bars suggest that 'Desire' or 'Magic', as this motive is sometimes called, is constantly apparent beneath grief and sorrow, and can in fact help overcome grief and sorrow. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.47">
<s n="s1.3;p12.47">Another motive, the 'Death' motive, occasionally 'drops' into the music and is played on the brass instruments, creating a sinister disruption of the smooth waves of strings echoed by the woodwind. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.47">Throughout the Prelude I am reminded of the sea. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.47">The waves of music become steadily stronger in anticipation of the climax and the continual echoes of the motives played on first one set of instruments, then on another, not only evokes a sense of yearning, but further that of a tide edging forward more strongly every time before being drawn back. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.47">
<s n="s1.3;p13.47">During the build to the climax, the echo of the 'Desire' motive continues, as, with each wave of strings, steadily becoming higher and more joyful, the 'Desire' notes become increasingly prominent in the background at the end of each wave. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.47">This culminates in the motive overcoming all when played on the brass instruments at the peak of the climax. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.47">The motive then echoes itself, played quietly on the oboes immediately afterwards. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'He prescribes a slight holding back after the peak has been reached... The Prelude - and the same is even true of the Liebestod - is far more tremendous in its tension when the ascent is not hurried...'<ref target="BAWE_0024e-ftnote.005"/>

<s n="s3.3;p16.47">The music makes 'no attempt...to epitomise the stage action and the characters of the opera...the Prelude is the slow musical elaboration of a single bitter-sweet mood.'<ref target="BAWE_0024e-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p17.47">Although the almost unbearable yearning fraught by the ever- present foreboding mood created by the opening are sufficient enough as they are to listen to, Wagner recaptured the very essence of all the emotions experienced in <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi>, in his Overture. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p18.47">However, on listening to the whole work, Wagner's belief that the highest level of poetry and music's ultimate expression should be combined to create a new Music Drama is made clear, and indeed the music does become more powerful when combined with the voice and vice versa. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p24.47">A new motive - that of 'Day' is used here, (although it first appears at the start of the Prelude to Act Two). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.47">While we usually associate the coming of day with fresh and joyful feelings, Wagner's motive completely conveys the misery it means to the lovers and their defiance of 'Its idle pomp, its boastful glare.' </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.47">The motives take our minds back to the emotions and moods we felt at previous points in the opera. </s>

<p n="p26.47">
<s n="s1.9;p26.47">The music has lost its sense of urgency at this point and peacefulness descends as the lovers rejoice in the onset of darkness; 'holy twilight's glorious presentment obliterates the horror of delusion, setting us free from the world.' </s>
<s n="s2.9;p26.47">The feeling of yearning remains however. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p26.47">With the smoothness and calmness of the libretto there is a sense of nervousness throughout this passage I feel. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p26.47">Further still, it prepares us for the voice of Brangaene. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p26.47">This is a phrase in which the music and the soprano achieve a sense of urgency and fear without becoming frantic or changing the peaceful mood already established. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p31.47">The music is powerful enough alone - although the voices become an extension of it, rather than instruments used to perform the libretto. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p31.47">In this role, they enable the final climax of Act Two to rise to an even greater peak than the orchestra alone would let it. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p32.47">It has been said, that the three acts of Tristan and Isolde come close to resembling a three- hour orgasm. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.47">When one takes into account the feelings of the characters as described in the poetic verse, this remark may seem perfectly legitimate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.47">However, I think to regard the love the characters feel for each other as purely romantic or sexual is viewing the opera on one level only and this evades its deeper meanings. </s>

<p n="p33.47">
<s n="s1.2;p33.47">It is true that many of the passages are incredibly erotic - but this only takes us so far. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p33.47">Wagner expresses the feelings of Tristan and Isolde in such a way that they transcend anything that is usually thought of or labelled as 'love'. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p34.47">The closing 'Liebestod' illustrates this. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p35.47">And yet this is the point at which the most blissful passage is sung with great euphoria by Isolde, gazing down on her dead beloved. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.47">It has to be admitted that the supreme joy of Isolde believing in the power of death in love and Tristan's escape to 'Unconscious - supreme bliss!' goes slightly beyond the conventional expression of love. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p36.47">Liebestod is my favourite passage of <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p36.47">It was the first piece from the opera I heard and, stands equally well on its own as an individual piece of music as the Prelude does. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p37.47">I have been concerned during this essay to come to terms with the changing roles of music and libretto. </s>

<p n="p38.47">

<p n="p39.47">
<s n="s1.3;p39.47">The Liebestod begins quietly - the music serving more as a background allowing the soprano to carry the melody forward. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p39.47">The key change on 'soaring on high' sees the build to the climax progressing. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p39.47">As Isolde's verse becomes more excited, 'How softly and gently from his lips sweet breath flutters- see friends!' the music gradually begins to catch up with and soar beyond the libretto, conveying her increasing rapture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.47">
<s n="s1.3;p40.47">Again Wagner is careful to hold back slightly rather than rushing headlong into the climax. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p40.47">There is a brief pause at this point and on 'Do I alone hear this melody?' the Liebestod begins afresh. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p40.47">This technique reinforces the feeling of absolute desire communicated from the start of the opera and ensures that the audience crave for this desire to be fulfilled - the climax to be resolved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.47">
<s n="s1.2;p41.47">At the point of 'in its blissful lament', the orchestra and the voice cease conflict and merge so that Isolde's voice is carried by the melody. </s>

<p n="p42.47">
<s n="s1.2;p42.47">Thus the final build begins: the tremendous surge of the orchestra perfectly complimenting the libretto, 'Are they billows of heavenly fragrance? </s>

</p>
<p n="p43.47">
<s n="s1.3;p43.47">The orchestra and voice reach such a point on the verge of climax, that they appear to slow slightly before the music peaks on 'of the world's breath'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p43.47">This is a point where Wagner's opinion of music reaching the pinnacle of it's expression leaving no other choice but to add words, is completely understandable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p43.47">Without the highest (sung) note I fear the climax would be vaguely disappointing. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.47">
<s n="s1.3;p44.47">The utmost relief that the climax which has built so gradually has finally happened enables us to fully appreciate the beautiful 'coming back to earth' as it were, suggested in the music by the key change on 'to sink'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p44.47">Again the libretto is complimented by the dying down of the music, 'to drown, to sink unconscious - supreme bliss!' </s>
