<s n="s1.4;p1.22">Over the past several decades, the visibility of child soldiers has become increasingly common. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.22">Countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Columbia and East Timor, to name but a few, illustrate the ubiquity of problem.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.001"/> While child soldiers are covered by provisions under international law, these rules are inadequate to deal with the conditions of armed conflict in the world today. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.22">There remain significant shortcomings and gaps in these laws that leave child soldiers in a more vulnerable and precarious situation than they are in already. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.22">One of the prominent features of the contemporary use of child soldiers is that the majority of conflicts in which children engage in hostilities are internal armed conflicts.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<p n="p2.22">
<s n="s1.4;p2.22">When discussing the issue of child soldiers, there are several elements that need to be addressed. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.22">The first is the issue of prohibition of the recruitment and use of children and the laws that govern such prohibition. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.22">The second is if, despite prohibition, children are used in armed conflict, how they should be treated during the conflict and if captured by enemy forces. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.22">The last issue relates more to the post-conflict situation and whether child soldiers should be held responsible and accountable for their actions if they constitute crimes against humanity or other crimes recognized under international criminal law as requiring prosecution. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.22">
<s n="s1.2;p3.22">This report will focus on the laws prohibiting the recruitment and use of child soldiers in addition to looking at what legal provisions exist for the treatment of child soldiers when they are used in contravention to the law. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.22">While there is also clearly a problem of the efficiency in the law's execution and implementation, this report will not cover this issue, but will focus on the actual deficiencies of the law. </s>

<head rend="underlined">International Legal Standards on Child Soldiers</head>
<p n="p4.22">
<s n="s1.4;p4.22">The regulation of the recruitment and participation of children in armed conflict is covered by a number of international law instruments. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.22">International humanitarian law, which regulates the conduct of hostilities, is naturally the most obvious starting point when looking at legal rules governing children in armed conflict. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.22">However, a variety of other instruments from human rights law to labour law also have relevant provisions regarding children in conflict. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.22">This section will look at the different provisions in international law concerning child soldiers, highlighting any inconsistencies and ambiguities in the law. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.22">
<s n="s1.4;p5.22">There are three main elements that legal rules address with regards to child soldiers.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.003"/> The first is the age limit, which usually revolves around discussion of whether the age of 15 or 18 should be used when determining the minimum age to engage in hostilities. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.22">The second is the issue of recruitment and whether or not it is compulsory or voluntary. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.22">Recruitment is also tied to the issue of age, particularly when addressing voluntary recruitment, which will be elaborated further below. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.22">The third main element is what type of participation is allowed and this is usually divided into direct and indirect involvement. <ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.003">

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The ICRC's preliminary materials for the Conference of Government Experts suggests that direct "establishes the relationship of adequate causality between the act of participation and its immediate result in military operations" (as qtd. in Mann, 1987, 45). </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">However, Mann (1987, 46) points out that 'direct' is not strictly defined and other authors have provided illustrations for its application mostly based on the immediate threat to the adversary, rather than give a definition. </s>

<head rend="italic">International Humanitarian Law: the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols </head>
<p n="p6.22">
<s n="s1.5;p6.22">The 1949 Geneva Conventions do not discuss children in the context of combatants. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.22">While the Geneva Convention IV makes many references to children, it does so with a civilian status in mind, and while the first three Geneva Conventions focuses on combatants, they do not broach the issue of the possibility of children as combatants. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.22">The 1977 Additional Protocols on the other hand do include provisions on the recruitment and use of children during armed conflict. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.22">Article 77(2) of Protocol I states that parties to the conflict "shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces." </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.22">In a similar vein, Article 4(c) of Protocol II states that children under the age of 15 "shall neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in hostilities." </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head>Age Limit</head>
<p n="p7.22">
<s n="s1.2;p7.22">While both Protocols establish 15 as the minimum age for recruitment, Protocol I has an additional statement that when recruiting between the ages of 15 and 18, priority should be given to the oldest.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.005"/> This is not stated in Protocol II which governs internal armed conflicts. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.22">Since Protocol I expressly states where priority should be given, it is unclear whether this means that priorities do not need to be made in internal armed conflicts. </s>

<head>Type of Participation</head>
<p n="p8.22">
<s n="s1.3;p8.22">The second difference is that Protocol I makes reference to "direct" involvement in armed conflict, whereas Protocol II makes no such reference. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.22">This seems to imply that indirect involvement would be permissible in international armed conflicts. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.22">That there is a distinction between direct and indirect involvement is supported by the fact that the ICRC was opposed to the insertion of 'direct' in Protocol I, although this went unheeded.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<head>Recruitment</head>
<p n="p9.22">
<s n="s1.3;p9.22">There is also an ambiguity about the definition of recruitment and whether this encompasses both compulsory and voluntary enrollment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.22">The ICRC had proposed during the drafting of Article 77(2) of Protocol I that States should refrain from accepting voluntary enrollment of children under 15, but this did not make it to the final text. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.22">Due to the fact that Geneva Convention IV<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.007"/> expressly uses 'voluntary enlistment' this implies "a difference between recruitment and voluntary enlistment" which leaves the potential for children under 15 to enroll in the armed forces. <ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">Van Bueren also points out that during the second reading of the CRC, recruitment and voluntary enrollment was viewed as two separate categories by Algeria who argued that children who wished to volunteer enroll in armed forces, particularly for national liberation wars, should not be dissuaded by States even with a minimum age for recruitment, 814. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s3.4;p11.22">However the door is left open for state parties to allow children under the age of 18 to take direct part in hostilities because of the reference to "all feasible measures" which means that in exceptional cases, a military commander may decide that it is not 'feasible' to withhold a soldier below the age of 18 from participating.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.015"/> In addition, the door is still left open for indirect participation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.22">However, voluntary recruitment under the age of 18 is permitted provided that there are certain safeguards such as ensuring that it is genuinely voluntary, having the consent of parents, and reliable proof of age.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.016"/> On the other hand armed groups, which are distinguished from armed forces of State are not allowed "under any circumstances" to recruit or use persons under 18. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p18.22">Another possible aspect of tension is the argument that placing a minimum age of recruitment infringes on the right to freedom of association (for example with the army, armed groups or national liberation groups), particularly for those between the ages of 15 and 18 who have reached a certain degree of maturity and development.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.031"/> Nonetheless, as Van Beuran has pointed out, "the evolving standards in international human rights law...sets the standard of 18 as the minimum age for recruitment," giving the example of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which is the most recently drafted child rights treaty.<ref target="BAWE_0360d-ftnote.032"/> </s>
