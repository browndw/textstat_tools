<head rend="bold">Conclusions</head>
<p n="p58.61">
<s n="s1.1;p58.61">The main conclusions that can be drawn from this investigation relate to the mechanics of a tyre and the relative merits of the simple linear model and the more complex non linear model used to calculate the forces applied on the tyre for the differing slip angles and slip ratios. </s>
</p>
<p n="p59.61">
<s n="s1.2;p59.61">This investigation has shown that lateral force increases as slip angle increases. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p59.61">The relationship is fairly linear for small slip angles, until about 2.5 degrees, then the rate at which lateral force increases, decreases with a steady increase in the slip angle.The lateral force can be linked to the lateral velocity of the tyre, and the resulting acceleration of the tyre in that direction as adhesion gradually decreases. </s>
</p>
<p n="p60.61">
<s n="s1.4;p60.61">The investigation has also shows longitudinal force increases as slip-ratio increases. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p60.61">As with the relationship between lateral force and slip angle, a near linear relationship occurs for small values of slip-ratio and then the rate at which longitudinal force increases decreases, for steady increases in slip-ratio. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p60.61">The increase in longitudinal force corresponds to decreases in the frequency of rotation of the tyre. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p60.61">This is reasonable since a decrease in rotation requires an increased braking force to oppose the rotation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p61.61">
<s n="s1.2;p61.61">The non-linear models have been shown to be more useful, as they provide greater accuracy over a wider range of slip angle and slip-ratio readings than the simple linear models. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p61.61">With no benefit for using the linear models over lower values either, they become defunct as MATLAB's computational power makes complex analysis instantaneous. </s>

<p>The linear regression used in this investigation is achieved by the least squares method which is outlined in this appendix.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a single regressor or predictor x and a dependent or response variable y. The relationship between y and x could be a straight line where the observation y at each level of x is a random variable. The expected value of y for each value of x is</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.023"/>
</p>
<p>where the intercept <hi rend="sub">0</hi> and the gradient function <hi rend="sub">1</hi> are unknown regression coefficients. <hi rend="italic">y</hi> can therefore be described by the model</p>
<p rend="ordered">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.024"/>
</p>
<p>where is a random error with a mean zero and variance <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. Random errors are assumed to be uncorrelated random variables.</p>
<p>Given n pairs of observations (<hi rend="italic">x</hi>
<hi rend="sub">1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
<hi rend="sub">1</hi>), (<hi rend="italic">x</hi>
<hi rend="sub">2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
<hi rend="sub">2</hi>),......., (<hi rend="italic">x</hi>
<hi rend="sub">n</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
<hi rend="sub">n</hi>), estimates of <hi rend="sub">0</hi> and <hi rend="sub">1</hi> should result in a 'best fit' straight line.</p>
<p>The least squares method is based on the estimates for <hi rend="sub">0</hi> and <hi rend="sub">1</hi> in equation (1) that will minimise the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations of the observations from the 'best fit' line.</p>
<p>Using equation (1) we may express the n observations in the sample as</p>
<p rend="ordered">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.025"/>
</p>
<p>and the sum of the squares of the deviations from the regression line is</p>
<p rend="ordered">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.026"/>
</p>
<p>The least squares estimates of <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.027"/> and <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.028"/>, say, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.029"/> and <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.030"/>, must satisfy</p>
<p rend="ordered">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.031"/>
</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.032"/>
</p>
<p>These simplify to</p>
<p rend="ordered">
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.033"/>
</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.034"/>
</p>
<p>Equations (5) are the 'least squares normal equations'. The solution to this pair of simultaneous equations results in the least squares estimates <hi rend="sub">0</hi> and <hi rend="sub">1</hi>.</p>
<p>The estimated regression line is therefore</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.035"/>
</p>
<p>For each pair of observations the following relationship is always satisfied</p>

<p>where <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0249g-form.037"/> is the error in the fit of the to the model to the i<hi rend="sup">th</hi> observation <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
