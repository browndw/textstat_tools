<s n="s1.3;p1.9">Businesses are constantly facing the dilemma to balance between the two basic organizational objectives. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.9">One is the need to be flexible in order to tackle emergent changes in the micro and macro environment, whilst the other is the necessity to implement long-term strategic direction. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.9">This essay will discuss whether increasing short-term flexibility or pursuing a long-term strategic plan is more fundamental. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.9">
<s n="s1.6;p2.9">Most businesses operate alongside a constantly changing internal and external environment. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.9">The internal (or micro) environment refers to the infrastructure of a business and is concerned with the relationships between members in the organization. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.9">The external (or macro) environment, on the other hand, refers to the market in which the business is operating in. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.9">Although the unpredictable environment directs businesses to numerous opportunities, it also generates a high level of ambiguity and insecurity in the firm. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.9">In order to cope with these changes and to sustain competitiveness in the market, businesses are required to develop swift responses to internal and external changes. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.9">Thus, managers are required to establish the maximum level of flexibility in the short-term to accommodate unexpected changes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.9">
<s n="s1.4;p3.9">However, according to Robbins, businesses generally adopt strategies to plan "the overall direction of the work to be done"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.001"/>, which includes "forecasting future trends, assessing actual and potential resources and developing objectives and targets for future performance"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.9">This reflects a long-term strategic approach, where businesses arrange carefully and tactfully for organizational goals to be achieved over at least ten years time. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.9">These organizational goals are often concerned with establishing clear internal policies and handling relations with competing firms. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.9">The managerial role in the long run is concerned with implementing strategic plans to achieve set organizational targets. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p4.9">Most business strategies allow short-term elasticity and long-term goals to be achieved simultaneously. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.9">Studying models of management, such as the Open Systems models, sheds light on how short-term flexibility and long-term strategic plans are equally important in business strategies. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.9">Early theorists assumed a business to be a closed system, and hence, focused on the inner arrangements of a business such as altering policies and working incentives for employees.<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.003"/> However, the Open Systems models stress on the view that "organizations depend on the wider environment for different kinds of sustenance if they are to survive and prosper"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.9">The fundamental idea is that organizations are interdependent.<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.005"/> Hence, if an organization is able to respond flexibly and acutely to changes in its surroundings, then the long-term capacity of the organization should, in theory, be amplified as well. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p5.9">Yet the constantly changing environment makes it difficult for managers to motivate employees to consider both short-term and long-term welfare of their company at an equal standing. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.9">Some firms tend to use strategies that consider establishing flexibility in the short-term to be of greater concern. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.9">The most distinguishing strategy is the measurement and reward system, where it is recognized that "short-run goals will prevail"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.9">Employees are frequently motivated to compete for short-range successes such as bonuses and promotions<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.9">Although a well-designed rewards system will motivate employees to be highly efficient, it is difficult to assess whether the long-term interests of the firm will be well-maintained. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.9">The reason is because employees are merely driven by self-interest and short-term successes in this system. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.9">When the weight is on strengthening a business' flexibility to address emergent changes, long-term strategic plans can be easily overlooked. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.9">Since the long-term direction is only dependent on the chief executive officer and a few of the high-ranking managers, the business becomes more susceptible to errors in judgment. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p6.9">Alternatively, businesses can place emphasis on long-term strategic performance and direction. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.9">Pursuing a long-run perspective is crucial to a business' success because every business needs a set goal to work towards. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.9">In the case of Chem-Tec Ltd, Bill Johnson has encouraged employees to take on larger roles for themselves<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.9">Since Johnson's concept is to develop the business strategy of "managing others at the same time as managing themselves"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.009"/>, he taught employees not only the skills, but also the purpose behind the work involved. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.9">Johnson eventually transferred his managerial perspective to employees in Chem-Tec, so that "they can now plan production and raise purchase orders"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.010"/> independently. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.9">As Johnson decentralizes his managerial responsibilities, Chem-Tec gains flexibility because employees are no longer entirely dependent on the manager to make decisions. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.9">Since employees are aware of the long-run managerial perspective, they will be able to base their decisions on the long-term welfare of Chem-Tec. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p6.9">Hence, it is justifiable to propose long-term strategic plans to be more crucial. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p7.9">The decentralization of operations is also a situation where businesses face the dilemma of deciding whether an emphasis should be placed on the short-term or the long-term. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.9">Texas Instruments, Inc. decentralized their operations as its business grew in size in order to increase the level of flexibility and efficiency<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.9">However, managers became concerned about how the division "would become short-term oriented and fail to see and solve problems on a scale appropriate to the total organization"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.9">Therefore, Texas Instruments reinstated corporate values into the entire operating system by setting corporate objectives, which acted as guidelines describing the business' general direction. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.9">The purpose of these corporate objectives is to satisfy stakeholders in the company, and to create a "psychological rewards"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.013"/> system for motivating employees. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.9">The decentralization provides incentive by maintaining a personal sense of identity in the business, whereas corporate objectives reinforce the long-term organizational target that the business is trying to achieve. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.9">The decentralization process by itself will not be a successful business strategy, because it lacks a long run corporate vision for employees to follow. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p8.9">British Petroleum Co is an established business in the oil industry, but it is based on a culture so rigid and so inflexible that "financial proposals required 15 signatures before they could be accepted"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.9">When new businesses entered into the market, British Petroleum was incapable of responding to the increased competition. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.9">It was losing their monopoly in the oil industry. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.9">In order to stay in the oil industry in the long run, British Petroleum had to change its business policy from bureaucratic to flexible. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.9">As a result, Robert Horton initiated significant change in British Petroleum's business policy, namely 'Project 1990', and promoted the corporate "values of caring, trust, openness, teamwork, and cooperation"<ref target="BAWE_0271a-ftnote.016"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.9">These new corporate values encouraged the company to be more flexible when addressing unexpected changes or events. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.9">Since the ultimate concern is the long run position of British Petroleum, it can be argued that long-term strategic plans are more critical. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.9">The flexibility is, in a sense, a means, whereas the long-term direction is an end. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p8.9">The short-term flexibility is ultimately a tool used for contouring British Petroleum's, or any other business' organizational objectives. </s>
