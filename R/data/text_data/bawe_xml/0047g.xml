<s n="s2.2;p19.58">With regard to further analysis and diagnosis, this case will therefore focus upon the excessive urinary output and polydipsia which was detected during her recovery phase, as this provides a valuable opportunity to discuss the investigation and management of acute polyuria. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Background</head>
<p n="p20.58">
<s n="s1.6;p20.58">Under normal physiological conditions thirst and water regulation are largely controlled by anti-diuretic hormone (ADH, or vasopressin), which is synthesized in the hypothalamus. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p20.58">ADH then migrates in neurosecretory granules along axonal pathways to the posterior pituitary. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.58">Pituitary disease alone without hypothalamic involvement therefore does not lead to ADH deficiency as the hormone can still 'leak' from the damaged end of the intact axon. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.58">At normal concentrations the kidney is the predominant site of action of ADH. ADH acts via two receptors known as V1 and V2. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.58">Stimulation of the V2 receptors allows the collecting tubule to become permeable to water, thus permitting reabsorption of hypotonic luminal fluid. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p20.58">ACH therefore reduces diuresis and results in overall retention of water. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.58">
<s n="s1.5;p21.58">Release of ADH is controlled by osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus which sense changes in plasma osmolarity. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.58">ADH secretion is suppressed at levels below 280 mOsm/kg, thus allowing maximal water diuresis. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.58">When plasma osmolarity rises above this level, ADH release occurs in direct proportion to plasma osmolarity in order to promote appropriate retention of water. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.58">Maximum ADH release occurs when the plasma osmolarity reaches 295 mOsm/kg. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.58">This represents the upper limit of normal plasma osmolarity, after which the sensation of thirst is experienced (usually at about 298 mOsm/kg) </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.58">
<s n="s1.1;p22.58">Acquired polyuria can therefore arise due to either: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p23.58">
<s n="s1.1;p23.58">Lack of ADH production: resulting from hypothalamic disease (Cranial diabetes insipidus) </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p24.58">
<s n="s1.1;p24.58">Lack of response of kidneys to ADH: renal tubules are insensitive to vasopressin due to abnormal receptors (Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.58">
<s n="s1.5;p25.58">Both these conditions, however, are comparatively rare and it is therefore important that commoner causes of polyuria are ruled out prior to further investigation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.58">Diabetes mellitus is an extremely common cause of polyuria, due the osmotic diuresis it induces. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.58">DM should therefore be excluded first by testing blood glucose levels. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.58">Secondly, a full medication history should be obtained to exclude the use of any therapeutic diuretic agents or excessive IV fluids. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.58">A full biochemical screen should also be carried out as renal tubular function may be impaired by electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalaemia or hypercalcaemia. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.58">
<s n="s1.1;p26.58">Once these causes have been excluded it is then possible to consider some specific causes of DI. A list of differentials is outlined below (Adapted from Longmore et al, 2004) </s>
