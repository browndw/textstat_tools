<s n="s1.4;p1.27">When we are asked to design a new system it is useful to ask ourselves questions to aid analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.27">With these questions in mind, we can then start to write down a specification for what we want from a system. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.27">These questions are the first stage in the design technique and come before any research or specification. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.27">They are part of the analysis of the problem. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.27">
<s n="s1.2;p2.27">The questions I asked myself first of all for the analysis of a design for a National Air Traffic Control System were concocted from initial thought without looking at how the analysis might break down to further distance the questions from each other and not create answers or part-answers that exist in more than one question. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.27">These questions are: </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p3.27">
<s n="s1.1;p3.27">What is the Hardware? </s>

<s n="s1.1;p6.27">When do they want the system for? </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p7.27">
<s n="s1.1;p7.27">Are there any other systems we need to communicate with? </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.27">
<s n="s1.3;p8.27">Coming up with these five questions off the top of my head takes less than 10 minutes. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.27">However, though they look different at first glance, once you try to break the question up you find that the sub-questions crossover each other or one question can be put into another. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.27">For example, question 1 can be placed as a sub-question of 2 because it is not general enough. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.27">
<s n="s1.1;p9.27">Before looking at the methods for isolating the questions by brainstorming the problem, to make comparisons between the earlier and later questions more possible, here are the final questions which will be used to analyse and research: </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p10.27">
<s n="s1.1;p10.27">How is the new system going to be introduced? </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p11.27">
<s n="s1.1;p11.27">What other systems does it need to talk to? </s>

<p rend="ordered" n="p14.27">
<s n="s1.1;p14.27">What cost factors are involved? </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.27">
<s n="s1.5;p15.27">The best way to go about creating a set of key questions like this is to create a spider diagram, with the task at the centre and the key points you are trying to look at in the analysis, branched off around it. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.27">With relevant ideas to look at in these key points branched off around them. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.27">However, because I don't know what they key points are, it is impossible to create a spider diagram this way. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.27">Instead, we can use a bottom-up approach to the diagram, where we create a lengthily list of specific points to look at, and then categorise these into groups. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.27">I decided the best way to split the points was into groups of: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>SAFETY/SECURITY</item>
<item>USERS</item>
<item>COMPATIBILITY</item>
<item>AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY</item>
<item>MONEY - Upgrade ability, time limit, budget, bespoke/current package, etc.</item>
<item>WHY?</item>
</list>
<p n="p16.27">
<s n="s1.2;p16.27">The money group gives some examples of the points which all go into this group but not any others. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.27">Some groups may have very few points at all: WHY? is a point which has been made into a group on its own because it is so important, can't fir in any existing groups; and can't really have points attached because it it so selfexplanatory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.27">
<s n="s1.6;p17.27">With the points in groups we could now hopefully create a list of questions (given earlier) relating to those groups, whose answers will hopefully cover the points in the respective group. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p17.27">We can now compare the questions (6-10) and see that because of this grouping of points and backwards though processes involved in selecting groups, no two questions are related. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p17.27">Also there is more breadth to the questions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p17.27">For example, questions 8 and 9 may cross paths talking about the lifespan of a system, but can't give answers that can have similar points. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p17.27">Compare this to questions 1, 2 and 4, which can all talk about hardware. i.e. question 2 could easily go into the hardware of the current system, and question 4 could say what hardware the company my need/has purchased to run the new system on. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p17.27">Both leave question 1 obsolete. </s>

<s n="s3.10;p20.27">Because the device is portable, the engine must reflect this requirement and not be substantially heavier than about 7kg and must have the same moment as the front of the device if resting on someone's shoulder at a shoulder support. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p20.27">The engine should not have more that 3 times the diameter of the device to make sure it does not stand out as an eyesore to the rest of the device or be bulky. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p20.27">The engine should be able to operate in any orientation and not be sensitive to shock or vibration, which it will endure, in daily use. </s>

<s n="s8.10;p20.27">To allow for different circumstances of use, the r.p.m. of the engine must be adjustable by the user and an idle mode should be incorporated to allow the engine to run at a slow speed between uses or short carrying journeys. </s>

<s n="s1.26;p24.27">For a more detailed look at the engine, I will look at the carburettor. </s>
<s n="s2.26;p24.27">A carburettor mixes the air and fuel into an emulsified form, which can then be sucked into the combustion chamber. </s>
<s n="s3.26;p24.27">Its basic form comprises a tube with a narrow passage known as the choke tube (or venturi), which contains a jet through which fuel can flow. </s>
<s n="s4.26;p24.27">As the engine sucks in mixture, it draws air through the carburettor and venturi. </s>
<s n="s5.26;p24.27">As the air is sucked in, it increases velocity inside the choke tube. </s>
<s n="s6.26;p24.27">A situation then occurs where air cannot get through the venturi in the same quantity as it can the rest of the carburettor/inlet manifold. </s>
<s n="s7.26;p24.27">This decreases pressure in the venturi; thereby fuel is sucked in as the pressure is lower than that at the other end of the fuel-line. </s>
<s n="s8.26;p24.27">The fuel is sprayed into the venturi through a jet in a fine mist. </s>
<s n="s9.26;p24.27">This mist evaporates into the air. </s>
<s n="s10.26;p24.27">Just after the choke tube is a butterfly valve (throttle) which can be varied between opened and shut to regulate the pressure (i.e. amount) of fuel/air mixture allowed into the combustion chamber to make the engine run faster (more mixture can be burned: bigger explosion), or slower. </s>
<s n="s11.26;p24.27">Similarly, just before the choke tube is another butterfly valve called the choke tube. </s>
<s n="s12.26;p24.27">This again can be manually opened and closed to allow more or less air through. </s>
<s n="s13.26;p24.27">As you close the valve, pressure in the choke tube decreases even further at the set throttle, and so more fuel is added to the air to enrich the mixture. </s>
<s n="s14.26;p24.27">This is particularly desirable when the engine is cold, as you don't get such a lean burn. </s>
<s n="s15.26;p24.27">The component is made from metal - probable stainless steel or a light alloy to prevent corrosion externally in damp conditions. </s>
<s n="s16.26;p24.27">Because of the nature of the fuel used, there will be little internal corrosion. </s>
<s n="s17.26;p24.27">The surface will have to be made as smooth as possible to limit the effect of friction between the mixture and the carb. tube, which could make the fuel condense. </s>
<s n="s18.26;p24.27">This is particularly true with regards to the butterfly valves, which look to be made of brass to limit this effect further. </s>
<s n="s19.26;p24.27">The carburettor was probably case by pouring molten metal into a die and leaving it to cool and set hard. </s>
<s n="s20.26;p24.27">The product was probably then taken out of the die and any sand (dependant on material) from the fuel/airways removed by air blasting. </s>
<s n="s21.26;p24.27">The components that make up the butterfly valve were made separately. </s>
<s n="s22.26;p24.27">Indeed the pivot shaft for the butterflies may have been extruded from molten metal. </s>
<s n="s23.26;p24.27">There would had been several carburettor bodies done in one casting to save energy cost and time. </s>
<s n="s24.26;p24.27">The whole thing would then be assembles on a production line on a continuous or mass scale. </s>
<s n="s25.26;p24.27">To estimate air pressures and speeds in the carburettor tube and the choke tube, one might look at how quickly the cylinder is drawing in air and relate this to the diameters of the tubes to see how much air will be drawn in. </s>
<s n="s26.26;p24.27">Similarly when the choke is closed we can see how much air could get in compared to the rate of the cylinder drawing air to calculate the vacuum in the choke tube. </s>
</p>
<p rend="ordered" n="p25.27">
<s n="s1.9;p25.27">There are 3 faces which interact with other components. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p25.27">Just before the choke the face is machines flat to connect to an air filter by 4 bolts taken through holes in the unit. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p25.27">Another face has a lipped edge to accommodate a fuel hose with a rubber dome. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p25.27">This dome can be pressed to push extra fuel into the choke tube, thereby increasing fuel/air mixture. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p25.27">Commonly called a tickler. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p25.27">The face opposite the choke end is machined flat to be attached to the inlet ports on the engine via bolts located through holes on the face. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p25.27">A gasket between the two faces ensures an airtight fit. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p25.27">The carburettors are not susceptible to much wear, only where the spindles of the butterflies rub against the bores in the carburettor. </s>
