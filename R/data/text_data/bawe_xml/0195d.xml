<s n="s3.6;p2.34">These in turn have prompted an increasingly multi-layered system of governance with sub-state and supra-state authorities as well as global private authorities. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.34">The world politics has changed significantly, making transnational decision-making unavoidable.<ref target="BAWE_0195d-ftnote.001"/> But one can easily notice that, for instance, the meetings of the World Bank or other global agencies are held behind closed doors. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.34">These kinds of institutions cannot be held accountable not even when their decisions have a negative impact. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.34">Is there a possibility "to reconcile the principle of the rule by the people with a world in which power is exercised increasingly on a transnational (...) scale"? <ref target="BAWE_0195d-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<head rend="bold italic">4. Conclusion</head>
<p n="p32.34">
<s n="s1.12;p32.34">This essay has tried to assess the extent to which the concept of cosmopolitan democracy applies to the European Union. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p32.34">The first section of the essay described the EU as the most developed regional integration arrangement, which already displays a history of common development towards a liberal-cosmopolitan type of democracy. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p32.34">One can admit that the EU is the only instance where there has been an attempt (though imperfect it may be) to introduce democracy at a supra-state level though different theoretical accounts are divided in terms of which model of democracy is (or should be) developed by it. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p32.34">The second part of the essay continues the description of cosmopolitan democracy inside the EU. Although the EU by definition cannot be a cosmopolitan, as in global, type of democracy, it may nevertheless provide a lesson for future projects of global democratisation. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p32.34">European integration has been facilitated by the fact all member states are ensured a voice in the decision making process. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p32.34">The EU has willingly surrendered sovereignty for the sake of co-operation and integration in order to solve transnational problems that the states alone cannot solve. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p32.34">This surrender is rewarded. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p32.34">Not only are states and regions supported to develop in the global economy but also European citizens are provided with authorities to which they can appeal. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p32.34">In a cosmopolitan fashion, individual rights in the EU are prior to state sovereignty. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p32.34">The social and political dimensions of the EU seem to bring politics closer to the citizens of Europe, by conferring rights as well as duties upon them. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p32.34">Representation of the needs and values of citizens and regions (although imperfect) is a reality, as evidenced by the direct elections to the European Parliament, the workings of the Committee of Regions, and the activity of the European Court of Justice. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p32.34">Indeed, the EU has taken some steps towards this form of re-territorialization by searching for a European identity and citizenship. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.34">
<s n="s1.5;p33.34">However, as the third section of the paper argues, both the European construction and the cosmopolitan democracy project suffer from crucial flaws. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.34">Some of these flaws are common to both For instance, the concept of liberal democracy may not be the 'standard' model of democratisation neither at the regional nor at the global level. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.34">Moreover, the communitarian critiques refer to both cosmopolitan and EU construction as artificial inventions that will never enjoy the same communal attachments as the nation-state. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.34">The EU as well as the cosmopolitan democracy project should focus not only on institutional changes but most of all to identity construction. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p33.34">Moreover, the observation that only strong elites usually encourage enhanced supra-state regulation as well as the accusation that supra-state democracy will always be in deficit applies to both the European construction and the cosmopolitan democracy project. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.34">
<s n="s1.7;p34.34">The paper concludes that even if the EU may be seen as a model of transnational (cosmopolitan) democracy, the model itself (based on the hegemonic concept position of liberal democracy) needs re-conceptualisation as it cannot be just re-iterated as such at the supra-state level. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p34.34">The attempt to draw the map of European or global democratisation following traditional liberal democratic patterns may have crucial flaws. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p34.34">Overall, the EU offers useful insights on the applicability of the cosmopolitan democracy project. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p34.34">But given the fact that even after more than fifty years of development, the model suffers from crucial democratic deficits, one can easily question the genuine possibility of the applicability of the cosmopolitan democracy project. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p34.34">Is it because the conceptual base of both projects, namely liberal democracy concept, cannot be applied at a supra-state level? </s>
<s n="s6.7;p34.34">Is it because people need more time to attach to another artificial creation, which is even larger than the state? </s>
<s n="s7.7;p34.34">These questions may be answered in another research paper. </s>
