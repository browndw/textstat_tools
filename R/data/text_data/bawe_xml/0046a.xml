<s n="s1.5;p74.83">Ectopics can present acutely, as in <name type="other"/>'s case. </s>

<list type="bulleted">
<item>laparoscopy - This is associated with lower postoperative morbidity and quicker recovery.</item>

<item>Salpingotomy. Products of conception removed with forceps or by suction; This is preferred if there is only one healthy tube, but it does increase the chances of a further ectopic by up to 20%. </item>
<item>Salpingectomy. Removal of the fallopian tube. This can be considered in the presence of a healthy contralateral tube.</item>
