<s n="s1.2;p12.55">The first objective when making material selection is to identify what the main function is for the component. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.55">In the case of the gas cylinder, the function is a Pressure Vessel which is subjected to internal loading. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.55">
<s n="s1.1;p13.55">Pressure vessels fall into two categories for the design, they are either yield before break or leak before break. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.55">
<s n="s1.3;p14.55">If a pressure vessel has been designed to yield before break, then the vessel under extreme conditions may become distorted (develop a bulge etc,) here the UTS needs to be significantly higher than the yield strength to ensure that the vessel remains intact even when distorted. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.55">If the pressure vessel is deigned to the leak before break failure criteria, then any cracks that appear in the vessel must not propagate. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.55">Instead the material must have a high fracture toughness, to ensure if a crack does appear it won't increase in size. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.55">
<s n="s1.1;p15.55">Since the main objectives for the selection process is cost and safety (strength) these can be considered important requirements, below is a list of specification requirements for a pressure vessel. </s>
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>Maximum Yield stress 685 MPa (for manufacture)</item>
<item>The Ultimate Tensile Stress (UTS) should be between 820-930 MPa</item>
<item>High endurance limit or Fatigue Stress - since the cylinder will be subjected to many re-fill cycles everyday.</item>
<item>Good Fracture Toughness - to with stand the shocks and loads that are associated with everyday wear and tear.</item>
<item>Good Corrosion resistance</item>
<item>High Strength and Hardness are also important, so that the cylinder isn't damaged if handled carelessly.</item>

<p n="p49.55">
<s n="s1.1;p49.55">If the pressure vessel was to contain hydrogen, then the material choice would be AISI 210 (annealed), due to its hydrogen embrittlement characteristics. </s>
