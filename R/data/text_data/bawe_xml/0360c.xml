<s n="s1.6;p1.20">The concept of burden-sharing in the context of forced migration raises a host of questions that ultimately spring from the question of what to do and how to deal with 'strangers' in our midst.<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.001"/> In forced migration these 'strangers' arrive seeking safe haven, and particularly in cases of sudden mass influxes, place burdens<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.002"/> and strains on the receiving host state. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.20">The Preamble of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (hereafter the '1951 Convention') acknowledges that "the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries," and hence "a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore achieved without international co-operation." </s>

<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The controversy regarding the use of the term 'burden' to describe refugees has been raised by various authors such as Noll (2003), Taylor (2005: 39), and therefore will not be discussed here. </s>

<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.7;p3.20">The term 'burden-sharing' was not used in the Convention, or in the drafting process. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.20">Instead, the notion of 'unduly heavy burden' was inserted in the Preamble by the French delegation with the desire to express "the great human importance of the refugee problem," the need to tackle the refugee problem "in a generous spirit", and to emphasize that the problem "could only be solved <hi rend="italic"> on the basis of justice, and not on purely legal considerations.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.20">"<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.004"/> Here the French delegation is appealing to justice as part of the resolution to solving the problem and not just legal considerations. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.20">The question that emerges is why are solely legal considerations insufficient to solve the problem? </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.20">Could a purely legal resolution to the problem possibly result in an <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> situation? </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.20">Does justice here refer to justice on behalf of the plight of refugees, or justice on behalf of host countries taking in refugees? </s>

</note>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.3;p4.20">The issue of justice with regards to the refugee situation is interesting for a number of reasons, one of them being the fact that one must think of justice not as a bounded concept within a particular community or nation, but of justice on a global or international scale simply because refugee flows inevitably traverse territorial boundaries, particularly in the case of massive displacement where refugees often spill across the borders of several countries.<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.005"/> Refugee movements are by their very nature forced rather than voluntary, and failure to allow exit or entry may result in severe human rights violations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.20">Debra Satz's remark that "humanity's claims are international" and that "neither nationality nor state boundaries, as such, have moral standing with respect to questions of justice"<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.006"/> is particularly salient here because refugees by their very nature contest territorial boundaries, and this comes up directly against the states' jealously guarded sovereignty. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.20">She adds that one of the main challenges facing contemporary cosmopolitanism is the tension between global justice and "territorially based forms of democratic government" and that unless the latter is restrained in certain instances, such as closed border exclusion, people will be left vulnerable to human rights violations.<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<head rend="italic">The debate surrounding 'unduly heavy burdens'</head>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.3;p6.20">As noted above, the French delegation inserted the paragraph making reference to unduly heavy burdens and was persistent in its effort to retain the paragraph and its reference to burdens.<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.009"/> The strong concern taken by the French for this issue is explained when they point out that they have already given asylum to half a million refugees during the Spanish civil war<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.010"/> and therefore they were "obliged to look to the future" since "there was no guarantee that France would not once more be faced with problems of the same magnitude." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s2.3;p6.20">Clearly, France was trying to assess the risk posed by refugees and to counter any possible future risk. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.20">By assuming the responsibility of taking a large number of Spanish refugees, they were naturally concerned that they may be placed in a similar position in the future and sought to "forestall such a danger."<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.012"/> </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.009">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Some delegations such as the US wanted the French suggestion removed, arguing that while cooperation was needed to alleviate the burdens on certain countries, the French text was not appropriate in what was to be a binding resolution, Weir (1995), 26. </s>

<s n="s2.3;pn1.1">Chimni (1998, 355-259) explains how a 'myth of difference' has been formulated to distinguish between refugees from the Third World and refugees from Europe immediate post-war period. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p7.20">However the debate regarding the reference to the distribution of refugees around the world continued to raise a certain degree apprehension among various delegations. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.017"/>

<s n="s3.4;p8.20">The argument made was that continental countries had no choice when faced with a large number at their borders to grant the right of asylum, or even refugee status. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.20">As a result, applying provisions of the Convention regarding rights to housing and to work would become nearly impossible without international collaboration.<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.018"/> The Italian delegation proceeded to support the views of the French adding that they "had always felt that the refugee problem was an international, and not a national responsibility."<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.019"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p9.20">The above debate clearly indicates that, as politicians and state representatives, the purpose was not to engage in the suffering of refugees but to formulate the policy that would be the most palatable. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.20">The French delegation may have sought to define the refugee problem in a manner "equitable both to the refugees themselves and to the countries which grant them hospitality,"<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.020"/> but the hesitation held by states on the burden-sharing paragraph illustrates the boundaries of such hospitality. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.20">Indeed, there was no discussion on how to specifically alleviate an unduly heavy burden, except for the reference to international collaboration, which was not expanded on further. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p9.20">In addition, a number of conceptual problems were not addressed such as how to quantify burdens and their cost<ref target="BAWE_0360c-ftnote.022"/>, and more importantly, what are the precise responsibilities that burden-sharing entails. </s>
