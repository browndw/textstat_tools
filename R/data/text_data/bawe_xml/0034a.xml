<s n="s1.10;p1.8">The 1990s witnessed a notable surge of interest and activity in both regions and regionalism and a sharpened awareness among states of the possibilities of regional cooperation. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.8">A study by the World Trade Organisation in 1995 highlighted some one hundred regional trade agreements in 1995 worldwide<ref target="BAWE_0034a-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.8">The vast institutional development of the European Union has led to an even larger economic market whilst mechanisms of cooperation in economic and security fields have evolved elsewhere. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.8">The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (1967) and the subsequent Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) (1989) have flourished, whilst regionalism has also occurred within North and Latin America; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) respectively. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.8">It is important to emphasise the focus within such regional projects, whether it be upon economic, political or security issues. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.8">Yet it is first necessary to define regionalism, for it is a term often confused with more vague forms of cooperation, and to establish a definition of sovereignty. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.8">A loss of sovereignty is commonly associated with regionalism - a claim frequently directed towards the EU. However, in contrast advocates of regionalism argue the process strengthens state independence and serves as a means of protection. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.8">The economic benefits of cooperation are frequently sited by regionalists who highlight the economic weight of the EU. The process may also benefit elites within states. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.8">The assumption that regionalism involves a loss of sovereignty however, can be challenged e.g. supporters of the EU emphasize the notion of 'pooled sovereignty'. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.8">It seems the traditional definition of sovereignty is perhaps less important in the modern global system given the rising significance of regionalism. </s>

<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.17;p2.8">It is first necessary to define the two terms central to this enquiry. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p2.8">Regionalism is said to refer to formal agreements made between states through intergovernmental negotiation. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p2.8">Conscious attempts are made to create formal mechanisms for dealing with common transnational issues. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p2.8">Stubbs and Underhill identify three central elements to regionalism; a common historical experience between the states concerned, close bonds between their societies and the emergence of organizations establishing the 'rules of the game'<ref target="BAWE_0034a-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p2.8">The concept of regionalisation refers to the actual processes of integration which bond people or economies together regardless of national boundaries; it most commonly refers to economic integration which may need no formal regional institution to thrive. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p2.8">Despite this the terms should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p2.8">Regionalisation is a common predecessor of regionalism whilst the latter may decrease the significance on national borders encouraging regionalisation. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p2.8">The first wave of analysis of regionalism occurred in the 1950s following the emergence of the European Economic Community, forged with a heavy emphasis upon security. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p2.8">Considerations concerned the sustainability of the nation-state. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p2.8">Neofunctionalist approaches, such as that of Ernst Haas, were widespread; issues were said to 'spill over' into other areas widening the role of the institution in contrast to Mittrany's view that functionally discrete organizations are required to manage certain areas. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p2.8">Haas implicitly raised the issue of sovereignty given his belief that neofunctionalism would result in regional organizations transcending the state system<ref target="BAWE_0034a-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p2.8">The end of the Cold War prompted a second wave of analysis of regionalism or 'new regionalism'. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p2.8">The development of the European <hi rend="italic">Union</hi> encouraged economic regionalism with the emergence of the common market whilst notions of European citizenship and a common foreign and security policy were advocated within the Maastricht Treaty (1991). </s>
<s n="s14.17;p2.8">This was accompanied however, by recognition that the EU did not, as Scheingold, Lindberg and Nye had speculated within the first wave, represent a predictive model for regionalism elsewhere<ref target="BAWE_0034a-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p2.8">The EU itself was evolving into a unique regional project. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p2.8">Within the field of international relations, sovereignty is referred to in an external sense; sovereignty relates to a state's place in the international order and its capacity to act as an independent entity. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p2.8">We shall now turn to discuss regionalism and its implications regarding this concept. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p3.8">A loss of sovereignty is commonly associated with a state's membership of regional institutions. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p3.8">It is a charge frequently held against the EU - the most formal and wide-ranging expression of regional cooperation which does indeed have supranational institutions capable of overriding national governments. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p3.8">Critics argue the EU will ultimately entail the construction of a 'regional state' in which the traditional role of national governments will become redundant. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p3.8">In what he termed <hi rend="italic">'the myth of teleology',</hi> Kenichi Ohmae suggests states have become irrelevant within the global political economy<ref target="BAWE_0034a-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p3.8">As the European Court of Justice noted <hi rend="italic">'by creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality...and, more particularly real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States to the Community, the member States have limited their sovereign rights'</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0034a-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p3.8">Within the EU the Council of Ministers holds a position of particular significance for it is capable of formulating policy with a relatively minimal amount of accountability given the introduction of qualified majority voting. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p3.8">Decisions can be taken with approximately 70% agreement. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p3.8">European law now overrides that of nation states if the two conflict. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p3.8">This was illustrated perhaps most clearly within the UK in the landmark Factortame case (1988). </s>
<s n="s10.14;p3.8">The Spanish fishing company Factortame appealed against restrictions imposed on them by the UK government through the Merchant Shipping Act arguing they were permitted to fish under EU law. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p3.8">Despite the Court of Appeal's ruling that no court could suspend Acts of Parliament, the ECJ ruled that national courts could strike down laws which contravened European law. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p3.8">Consequently the House of Lords ruled in favour of Factortame, meaning the act was struck down. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p3.8">Sovereignty is, thus, no longer guaranteed in the presence of regionalism. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p3.8">We must now turn to discuss what then persuades states to subscribe to regional organizations. </s>
