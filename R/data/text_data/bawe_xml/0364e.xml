<s n="s1.4;p1.41">Renold Plc is a multi-national precision engineering group producing amongst others industrial chains and related power transmission systems. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.41">Like all limited companies Renold Plc is required to produce an annual financial report that provides a 'true and fair view' of the company's performance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.41">In the case of Renold Plc the report produced complies with this belief, in the opinion of the Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the financial report provides a 'true and fair view' along with complying with all the relevant financial accounting standards such as those within the 1985 Companies Act. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.41">The implementation of the International Accounting Standards will mean there is an improvement in the stated profit before tax for the 2004/2005 annual financial report and this will affect the next financial report in several ways. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.41">
<s n="s1.3;p2.41">A variety of performance indictors can be used to evaluate the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial years along with an insight into the possible future performance. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.41">From the 2004/2005 annual financial report it is clearly seen that the company had a difficult year mainly due to the increase in steel prices of approximately 40% and the weakness of the United States Dollar. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.41">The future prospects for the company outlined in the narrative of the annual financial report 2005 and the interim report published 12 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> December 2005 show that there could be an increase in performance of the company over the next financial year and it is suggested that ordinary shareholders keep hold of their shares over the next financial year. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.41">All limited companies have to produce an annual financial report. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.41">Does this annual financial report provide a 'true and fair view' of the company's performance? </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.41">How reliable is this report to an ordinary shareholder as an indicator of both past and future performance? </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.41">
<s n="s1.5;p4.41">To evaluate the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial year it is necessary to consider a selection of performance indicators, these are selected to show the overall performance of Renold Plc. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.41">These indictors consist of ratios calculated from data contained within the annual financial report 2005 and the FAME database, along with other indicators such as turnover, share price and peer analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.41">These indicators will demonstrate the past performance of Renold Plc and give an insight into the possible performance in the next financial year. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.41">From this a recommendation to an ordinary shareholder can be made whether they should sell their shares, hold them or buy more shares. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.41">The indicators chosen are listed below: </s>

</list>
<p n="p5.41">
<s n="s1.2;p5.41">For the report to provide a 'true and fair view' the annual financial report needs to comply with the relevant financial accounting standards, which will be transferred to International Accounting Standards after the publication of the 2005 annual financial report. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.41">A series of accounting adjustments are applied to the financial report and these need to be considered and their impact on the reported profit in order to decide the reliability of the annual report. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p6.41">An important indictor of the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial year is to compare it to that of its peers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.41">The peer group report according to FAME (Table 1 ), shows how Renold Plc has behaved compared to similar companies (according to FAME) which are not necessary Renold Plc direct competitors. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.41">From Table 1 it is possible to see that Renold Plc was placed forth within the peer report according to turnover. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.41">Graph 1 illustrates that the turnover for Renold Plc (shown by the red line) is within the upper quartile of the peer group, which could indicate that the company is performing well. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.41">It is although hard to compare companies within the peer group directly as the financial year ends are different for each company so the market forces, such as steel price, may not have affected the other companies when they produced their last financial report from which the data for the FAME peer report is taken. </s>

<p n="p8.41">
<s n="s1.4;p8.41">This initial peer review is simplistic as it singularly considers turnover as a comparative, to discover the performance of Renold Plc compared to its peers it would be necessary to consider other performance indications. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.41">Table 1 shows that Renold Plc had a profit before taxation of -£6,800,000 which is ranked twentieth out of the twenty-one companies considered within the peer report. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.41">This shows that out of this group Renold Plc made a large loss before taxation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.41">As the peer report considers similar companies, not necessary competitors, the increases in steel prices that affected Renold Plc during the last financial year may not have affected them to such an extent therefore these companies may have made a profit before taxation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.41">
<s n="s1.4;p9.41">Within the FAME peer report for Renold Plc there are a large number of various performance indictors that can be used to compare the companies within the report. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.41">The last peer report indictor that will be considered here will be the Return on Shareholders Funds. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.41">The definition from J. R. Dyson is that return on shareholders funds is a measure of pre-tax profit against what the shareholders have invested in the entity.<ref target="BAWE_0364e-endnote.003"/> This performance indictor is extremely useful as it shows how profitable the entity is as an entirety and represents the efficiency that capital is being utilised within the entity to generate revenue. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.41">From Graph 3 it can be seen that Renold Plc has had a difficult financial year during 2004/2005 with a negative return on shareholders funds. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.41">Using the FAME peer report (Table 1) to evaluate the return on shareholders funds of Renold Plc compared to the other 18 companies (3 of the companies do not state a return on shareholders funds), Renold Plc is ranked 15th. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.41">Only four of the other companies within the report showed a negative return on shareholders funds, which suggests that the other entities within the peer group are finding the market situation adequate to utilise the capital within the entity to generate sufficient revenue. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.41">The return on shareholders funds is the most appropriate profitability ratio to consider when comparing a selection of different entities as it uses the net profit after interest but before taxation when calculating the ratio. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.41">J.R. Dyson warns that the taxation charge in the accounts of different entities can be subject to a variety of accounting adjustments and is therefore hard to compare one entity to another<ref target="BAWE_0364e-endnote.005"/>, so calculating the ratio before taxation allows comparison. </s>
