<head>0.1 Introduction</head>
<p>This project is, indeed, presented as a collation of two essays since they can be treated exclusively depending on prior knowledge. The first and second chapters deals with an introduction to the concepts we will need in the latter chapter. </p>
<p>The first topic is an introduction to dealing with smooth manifolds. Our introduction is obviously weighted heavily to accentuate the points we wish to discuss later - we have, however, digressed slightly at times with an exploration of points that, while not directly related, are very interesting. </p>
<p>We spend he next sections discussing what can be given the blanket term of algebraic topol-ogy. We discuss a little bit of homology although cohomology, particularly de Rham coho-mology, will be of most interest later. This is because of the link to integration on smooth manifolds. We also give an introduction to group cohomology and Galois cohomology and the application to representation theory in the form of the relationship between the Brauer group of some commutative ring and the second Galois cohomology - in particular, we intro-duce the Azumaya algebras which are important because the relationship mentioned above depends on an algebra called a crossed product being an Azumaya algebra. We then give a detailed exposition of Poincare duality - an useful tool later on. </p>
<p>The second chapter of the essay begins by discussing operations on the vector bundles introduced in the last chapter. The most important of these is the connection and the related curvature form. Indeed, when we deal with much of the mathematics in this area we are reminded of operations in differential geometry. We then discuss characteristic classes which are central to the focal discussion point of this essay. In particular we will discuss the Euler and Pontryagin classes after mentioning the simpler case of the Chern class. We also discuss the Stiefel-Whitney class which, as we will see, is the most important for our purposes. </p>
<p>The focus of this 'second essay' will be to explore the following proposition. </p>
<p rend="ordered">Proposition 1. <hi rend="italic">For any simply-connected, complex surface S with </hi>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.001"/>
<hi rend="italic">there is a smooth four-manifold X(S) which is homotopy equivalent to but</hi> <hi rend="bold">not</hi> <hi rend="italic">diffeomorphic to S, nor to any complex surface.</hi> </p>
<p>This proposition is actually a corollary of a more general theorem, the proof of which is the main topic for exploration in this essay. </p>
<p rend="ordered">Theorem 1. <hi rend="italic">For any simply connected, complex algebraic surface S, with </hi>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.002"/>
<hi rend="italic">and any hyperplane class h in H2(S) there is a k0 = k0(S,h) such that for k</hi> > <hi rend="italic">k and any Stiefel-Whitney class [α] which is the reduction of a</hi> (1,1) <hi rend="italic">class [</hi>αˆ<hi rend="italic">], we have </hi>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.003"/>. </p>
<p>Here are brief definitions of the terms above, although they make very little sense when unaccompanied by definition and proof of the mathematical basis of differenntial topology. For an oriented four-manifold X, a <hi rend="italic">Stiefel-Whitney</hi> class <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.004"/> is one of the characteristic classes of the tangent bundle <hi rend="italic">TX</hi> available, along with the Euler and Pontryagin classes as defined in Calculus to Cohomology. <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.005"/> is simply the dimension of the maximal positive subspace for the form on H2(X). <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.006"/> is a hyperplane class defined by a holomorphic embedding of S in a projective space. <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.007"/> is the dimension of the space of holomorphic 2-forms. Lastly, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.008"/> is a sequence of polynomials in <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0049b-form.009"/> which are invariant under diffeomorphism. </p>
<p>The two, related but distinct, parts of this essay arose separately from one piece of work, [J05]. This essay first explores division algebras - the main example being the quaternions H. This leads to 4-dimensional space and then to exotic manifolds after an interesting discussion. The essay also involves classification of division algebras, in which the Brauer group is involved in one method of classification. </p>
<p>The latter is quite an intense topic and also a very broad one in that it requires a lot of specialized maths - Hodge theory, algebraic geometry - just to get something sensible. Nevertheless, it is both interesting and productive. Thanks to Dr Allan Muir, Tim Honeywill and David Webdale for their advice and inspiration. </p>

<s n="s4.4;p7.326">It can be thought of as the correspondence between the point of spaces A and B when we deform A into B. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.326">
<s n="s1.3;p8.326">A manifold will be defined more accurately below but we can think of it in a simple way as a topological space in which the small bit surrounding each point can be compared to an Euclidean space. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.326">For example, the torus is a manifold since each point lies in a slightly curved area that can be deformed into a disk in the plane, but the cone is not a manifold since the neighbourhood of its vertex can not be deformed into a piece of the Euclidean plane. </s>
