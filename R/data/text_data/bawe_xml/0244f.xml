<s n="s1.4;p1.14">With the benefit of hindsight it is possible to look back on the Biennio Rosso, the two 'red years' of 1919-20, and see them as a failed revolutionary period where many of the pieces were in place to produce a revolution similar to that which had occurred in Russia only two years previously. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.14">However it was fascism which took hold in Italy and anti-liberalism which prevailed as the ideology. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.14">Benito Mussolini and others like him played on the people's fears about economic and political stability and attracted supporters from many backgrounds. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.14">Nonetheless, despite the speed and strength with which fascism appeared in Italy I am going to argue that this was only possible due to the huge divisions within the left and if the left had come together as a united force then they may well have had their revolution and stopped fascism at its roots. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.6;p2.14">Firstly though, I am going to explore the fascist counter-offensive and evaluate exactly how they were able to overcome both the Socialists and the Liberals. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.14">Despite the anti-liberal ideology behind fascism the Italian people were by no means forced into accepting it in 1919-20 and chose to support it due to a number of factors. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.14">Firstly, the aftermath of World War I had an immediate effect with Italy staking claim to the areas of Fiume and Dalmatia, something which American president Woodrow Wilson would not accept. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.14">The Italians actually walked out of the talks and this led to strong public support in pursuit of these areas and the real beginnings of a powerful nationalist sentiment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.14">These feelings were intensified when Gabriele D'Annunzio went against the allies and marched on Fiume occupying it for over a year. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.14">Martin Clark writes that "the plight of Fiume and Dalmatia provided slogans for all kinds of super-militant patriotic groups; it kept the spirit of 'interventionism' alive throughout the post-war years."<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.4;p3.14">The fascists cause was further helped by the subsequent fall of Fiume and the Treaty of Rapallo signed in 1920 which stated that Fiume was to be a free state and ensured that Italy renounced their claims to Dalmatia. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.14">"The Treaty of Rapallo was good propaganda for nationalists,"<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.002"/> as it made the Italians felt hard done by in a War which they had supposedly won. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.14">This, coupled with an economic recession which hit Italy in late 1920, deepened the industrialists gloom and "some of them became more willing to finance strike breakers and Right-wing extremists".<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.003"/> Obviously these circumstances were not under the control of the fascists but they made sure that they took advantage of the national mood. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.14">Mussolini's paper, the Popolo d'Italia, was successfully turned into a "spokesman for all the discontented extreme 'interventionists',"<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.004"/> and they were able to portray the occupation of the factories as a second rate priority. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p4.14">One of the main successes of the fascists was their ability to attract such diverse groups. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.14">Until 1919 the Fascist program was still seen as very radical but having failed to make inroads into the left electorate Mussolini began to make deals with landowners and industrialists. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.14">"Small leaseholders and owners, farm managers and artisans, share-croppers in Emilia, those who had bought or hoped to buy land, joined the squads and joined the Fasci." </s>

<s n="s4.6;p4.14">Also attracted to Mussolini's policies were some sons of economic elites, right wing and nationalist students and some returning troops who were angered by the socialist anti-war stance. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.14">Although many of the troops returning from the war had become anti-war themselves, they resented the fact that some socialists saw it as having been for nothing, that it was pointless and the pain and suffering which had occurred had been in vein. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.14">The Socialists lost out in many ways because of the cross section of people Mussolini appealed to; "He was the enemy of the Socialist party, but the friend of the trade unions and the working-class." <ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.14">It was with this support that Fascist expansion took place in the winter and spring of 1920-1 where the squadristi were able to conduct a "systematic campaign of terror against the Socialists and their local institutions (communal councils, party branches, trade unions, co-operatives and even cultural circles.)"<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.007"/> One example of this is on January 11 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1920 when Mussolini organised the wreckage of Bissolati's meeting at the Scala; "this was the first planned violence in post-war Italy." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s2.3;p5.14">The main reason that they got away with such behaviour is that "above all, the Giolitti government seemed soft on militancy." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s3.3;p5.14">By taking advantage of this and perpetuating the climate of civil war, they themselves helped to heighten the yearning for authority, order and an end to perpetual crisis, which was to allow Mussolini to present himself as the saviour of the nation. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p6.14">This is why so many people actively took part in the violence and why so few people seemed to try and hault it. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.14">They were helped by the fact that "the growth of the fasci in 1920-1 was powerfully assisted and sometimes even initiated by the regular Army." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s4.4;p6.14">However, despite all of the above ways the fascists were able to gain support they may not have been able to get away with methods such as the squadristi if the Socialists had shown themselves to be a viable alternative. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p7.14">In 1919 the Socialist Party was 200,000 people strong and they took control of 2,800 communes which was around 24 per cent of the total. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.14">On top of this they directed thousands of co-operatives and opened over 2,000 local sections throughout the country.<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.011"/> The stage was set for a left-wing revolution but the problem was that the workers had "brought the 'machine' of the bourgeois power shuddering to its foundations but did not bring it to collapse." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.012"/>
<s n="s3.5;p7.14">This occurred for a variety of reasons which I will explore below but the point needs to be illustrated of how close Italy came to a real worker revolution and how especially in the years 1919-20 they encountered little real resistance. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.14">This was partly because the government were not entirely sure how to cope with the labour unrest, in particular the occupation of the factories in Turin. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.14">Additionally, even as late as 1919, "the activities of the Fascist or Nationalist squads remained sporadic and usually marginal in their immediate political effects."<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.013"/> </s>

<s n="s3.4;p8.14">The leaders of both the P.S.I (the Italian Socialist Party) and the C.G.L. (the Italian Trade Union Congress) were essentially reformist and the rest of the members were "paralysed by the rivalry between the maximalists and the reformists, neither of whom were strong enough to get their own way." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0244f-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s4.4;p8.14">Even when the occupation of the factories was in full swing in 1920 the movement proved incapable of improvising a structure which had not previously existed, it was only in Turin where some effort towards doing so was made but it was too little, too late. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p9.14">However the maximalists were never successful, perhaps due to the fact that they had a rather soft core and they "provided only revolutionary talk as a substitute for revolution." </s>

<s n="s4.5;p9.14">They also isolated themselves by denouncing nationalists as warmongers and attacking the war in which so many had died or come back to find that their efforts had not been fully supported. </s>
