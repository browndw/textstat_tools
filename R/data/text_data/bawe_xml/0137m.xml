<s n="s1.6;p8.40">There are a number of methodological flaws when examining "Islam" which leads to limitations in its findings and conclusions. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.40">Firstly, we often view "Islam" and events in the Muslim world through the "prism of violence and terrorism" <ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.016"/> which has led to a failure to see beyond the "breadth and depth of contemporary Islam"<ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.40">It is true that the Middle East region has consistently appeared to be the most unstable and strategically volatile region in the whole Third World, and incidents such as the Suez Crisis, Arab-Israeli wars, Iranian Revolution, Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88, Gulf war of 1990-91 are sufficient to affirm the fact. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.40">Even if the Middle East is a volatile region, the threats it posed are more political than religious. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.40">Basing these political crises on "Islam" seems to advocate that "Islam" as a religion is to be directly blamed for advocating such inhumane acts of violence and terrorism. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.40">It is crucial that we distinguish between a religious or Islamic challenge and a direct political Islamism threat which "requires walking the fine line between myth and reality" <ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.018"/>. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p10.40">This also alludes to the fact that "Islam" is inherently in conflict with the "West" which is an oversight on our part to envision prospects for cooperation and compromise in the modern context. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p32.40">This is epitomized during United States' President Clinton's administration when it applied its "rogue state" doctrine of containment to radically Islamist states such as Iran and Sudan while steadfastly supporting Egypt and Tunisia in their brutal repression of all shades of Islamic activism in the name of eradicating "terrorism".<ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.055"/> On the other hand, it also urged "the military regime in Algeria to initiate a dialogue with "moderate" Islamists and to include them in democratic elections under international supervision" <ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.056"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p35.40">With all the above considerations in mind, the "West" should be prepared for new threats manifested in new dimensions. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p36.40">To conclude, there are various tenets encapsulated in this single argument for the threat of "Islamism" as opposed to the threat of "Islam". </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.40">
<s n="s1.6;p37.40">The subject at hand is that the threat of "Islam" does not and cannot exist. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p37.40">It does not exist because it is merely a myth that is fabricated from both inaccurate scholarly perceptions and unjust media portrayals that have adopted contemporary Islamic-related events around the world at face value. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p37.40">More importantly, the notion cannot exist in practice because of the realities of the external and internal struggles that "Islam" is facing today. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p37.40">"Islam" is neither a real nor a coherent threat in itself. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p37.40">Dismantling this construct of the stereotyped "enemy" does not signify a lack of criticism; rather it is a prerequisite for more serious critique of the methodologies adopted in constructing it in the first place. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p37.40">After all, it is realities that should be analyzed, not fantasies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.40">
<s n="s1.3;p38.40">While it is established that the notion of the threat of "Islam" does not and cannot exist, the threat of Islamism is possibly the most accurate concept that forms the basis of a conflict with the "West". </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.40">More importantly, the essay has reiterated that the fundamental threat against the "West" comes from the radicalized notion of Islamism which is also militant fundamentalism. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.40">This acknowledges the multifaceted dimensions of an Islamic threat; between the supposed unity of "Islam" and the diversity of its multiple and complex manifestations in the world today, taking shape in various realms - from geopolitics to socio-economics. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.40">
<s n="s1.6;p39.40">In approaching this subject at hand, the methodologies adopted must also be critically assessed. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p39.40">Fundamentally, we should not be accused of double standards when assessing the threat of "Islam" from predominantly a secular or outsider perspective. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p39.40">According to Jurgen Liminski, we should not seek to impose our own standards on what "Islam" should be as most Islamic countries in the Middle East "live according to a world of associations which cannot be comprehended or judged by European standards"<ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.063"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p39.40">Ultimately, we are also guilty of "misogyny, aggression, fanaticism and irrationality"<ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.064"/> which are not exclusive to the Islamic world. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p39.40">It is natural that we adopt completely different standards when we confront the same or different phenomena in other cultures, especially Islamic ones, but it is not an excuse for us to dismiss this biasness of ours. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p39.40">Contemporary "Islam" challenges the "West" to appreciate the diversity of the Muslim experience and perhaps challenge the "West" to stand by the democratic values it embodies to recognize the right of people and states to determine their way of life and nature of their governments, leaderships and societies.<ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.065"/> </s>

<s n="s2.5;p40.40">Perhaps the softer side of "Islam" does exist; nevertheless it will also be accompanied by the darker side. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p40.40">The reality is that there will be newer and more intensified fault lines between "Islam" and the "West" as the two will inevitably meet, yet this does not necessarily translate to an inevitable conflict simply because "the need for the two to live and work together in our increasingly interdependent world has never been greater"<ref target="BAWE_0137m-ftnote.066"/>. </s>
