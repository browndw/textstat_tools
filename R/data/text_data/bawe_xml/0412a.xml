<p n="p66.75">
<s n="s1.1;p66.75">One of the main reasons for this contradictory result is that, in the Solow Model it was assumed that all economies merely are at different points in the same <hi rend="italic">balanced growth path</hi> and will eventually converge when they achieve the same <hi rend="italic">steady state</hi> level of capital stock. </s>

<p n="p69.75">
<s n="s1.4;p69.75">Another reason for the contradictory result could be the fact that population growth hampers growth of per capita GDP. Carrying out a regression, I find that a 1% increase in population growth would decrease the GDP growth by 0.57%. </s>
