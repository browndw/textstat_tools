<s n="s1.7;p1.18">For this assignment I have chosen to research witchcraft. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.18">The essay title I will research is, 'Witchcraft is often thought of as destructive and irrational. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.18">Discuss why it persists as an important part of life in many African societies'. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.18">The key concepts I will pick out of this title is, witchcraft in African societies, by looking at how long it has been around, how often and who performs it. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.18">While also looking at the underlying issue, why is witchcraft important to people in African societies and not to people in other cultures/society. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.18">Therefore I will get a range of articles about different African societies to get different perspectives on witchcraft. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.18">I will also touch on an outsiders view. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.18">
<s n="s1.5;p2.18">When choosing which database to use for my research, I decided to try some out to see which one worked best for me. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.18">I tried using the Anthropological Index which was recommended but found the system hard to use. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.18">To use the search engine you had to be aware of what article you were looking for as you search using the date of the article, region it is form etc, and I am not aware of what article I need at this present time. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.18">Therefore this database did not seem right for what I am doing. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.18">I also found it very complicated and confusing to use. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.18">
<s n="s1.3;p3.18">I also tried using another database, Web of Science this was also recommended to me, I found this database relatively simple to use, as it had a good layout and a simply process. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.18">However once I had searched and found an article I could not work out how to read the article or obtain an abstract. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.18">Obviously this is important to be able to do so as I know that I have the correct article for my piece of work, without having to read through the whole article. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.18">
<s n="s1.4;p4.18">So to research my title I chose to use the search database International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), I choose this database as it was simple and straight forward to use. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.18">I could also search just using a keyword or term; I did not have to know the article I was looking for, which I found very useful. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.18">I was also able to do an advanced search to narrow the results down and once I had found a chosen article it was very easy to obtain an abstract of the article, with useful information about it and the author. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.18">Therefore I decided this would be the best search engine for me to carry out my search with. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.18">
<s n="s1.3;p5.18">Before I began my search I made a list of relevant keywords and phrases relating to the title. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.18">To start with I searched using the search term 'witchcraft' however this produced 1548 journals. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.18">I realised this term was far to board as it brought up too many results, about witchcraft in many countries, and most were based very loosely around the subject. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.18">
<s n="s1.3;p6.18">I decided to search using the words 'witch and Africa' by using the word 'and' I was able to search through all journals with both of these words in. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.18">So I was able to narrow down my search and it came up with only 23 journals. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.18">Although these search words produced articles relevant to the title I decided to narrow down my search further. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.18">
<s n="s1.3;p7.18">So I decided to search by using the words 'witch* Africa*' by using an asterisk (*) at the end of the words it gave me alternative endings e.g. it will not only find journals with witch in but witches, witchcraft etc. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.18">This search came up with 7 journals, which was a perfect amount to look through. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.18">It brought up some very useful journals, which related well to my title. </s>
