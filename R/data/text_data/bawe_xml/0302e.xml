<s n="s5.7;p1.19">Roosevelt was preoccupied with re-election and whites were too concerned with their economic situation to be willing to promote radical change for black Americans. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.19">By the end of the 1930s, the gap between whites and blacks in the workplace had widened even further; the period from 1930 to 1940 was "the only decade between 1890 and 1980 in which the ratio of black to white average earnings actually declined." </s>

<s n="s1.9;p3.19">The Depression's initial impact was less dramatic, though ultimately more damaging for minorities in America than for whites. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.19">This was due in part to the minimal impact that the "Roaring Twenties" had on marginal groups. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.19">Though the traditional view minimises its bleak side, many did not partake in, and even suffered from, the boom. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s7.9;p3.19">Many minorities such as blacks were therefore brought up surrounded by discrimination and racism. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s5.13;p4.19">By the end of the decade, blacks were 11% of the work force but only received 9% of the payroll.<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.014"/> Education and experience played important roles in the justification of discrimination against blacks by employers. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p4.19">As a result of poor education and upbringing, blacks were often less skilled than whites, and during the Depression less skilled workers were frequently the first to be sacked. </s>

<s n="s10.13;p4.19">Large- scale manufacturing industries such as steel and automobiles, which many blacks in the North were employed in, were also affected disproportionately. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p4.19">Interestingly, for the country as a whole "unemployment rates were somewhat lower for blacks than whites." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s12.13;p4.19">This, however, was because the majority of the black population was concentrated in the South, where unemployment rates for either race "were considerably lower than they were in the North." </s>

<s n="s2.12;p5.19">Described as the "last hired, first fired" principle, a series of reports on black employment issued by the National Urban League (NUL) supports the theory. </s>

<s n="s7.12;p5.19">Secondly, as noted by the NUL, the displacement of Negro workers "occurred primarily in the 'Negro jobs'"<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.021"/> such as waiters and domestic servants. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p5.19">This was because they were often on casual labour contracts ensuring fewer restrictions on the employer. </s>

<s n="s10.12;p5.19">"Shifts in public sentiment and social pressures to reserve jobs for whites,"<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.022"/> therefore, would have been felt particularly strongly in these professions. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p5.19">Paradoxically, historian Myrdal<ref target="BAWE_0302e-ftnote.023"/> suggests, the lack of blacks in the North prevented the creation of "Negro jobs" and may have discouraged such racially- motivated dismissals. </s>
