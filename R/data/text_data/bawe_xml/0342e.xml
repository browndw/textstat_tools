<s n="s1.6;p1.19">Jaguar belongs to the luxury automotive market. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.19">This is an oligopoly containing companies such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Austin Martin, Land Rover, Lexus, Porsche, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, etc. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.19">Jaguar's SIC code is 3410 (manufacture of motor vehicles). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.19">BMW is the market leader (Honda is not a luxury car manufacturer) with a profit of almost £80million (2004). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.19">Toyota (Lexus) is second with a profit of £50 million (2004). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.19">Jaguar however made a loss of £601million (2003). </s>

<p n="p2.19">
<s n="s1.3;p2.19">The industry is highly differentiated with products of high quality, cost, and speciality. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.19">With respect to the market adoption graph: the automotive industry is a cash cow. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.19">However, Jaguar is at the dog stage at the moment as the firm has a low market share and growth rate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.19">
<s n="s1.5;p3.19">A new firm would face many barriers trying to enter this market. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.19">It would have to build a reputation of quality. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.19">The specialist machinery needed to enter the industry would be extremely expensive, resulting in sunk costs, resale of which would be difficult. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.19">Leaving the market would also be difficult due to these sunk costs which could not be recovered. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.19">However, an existing firm could be acquired reasonably easily. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.19">
<s n="s1.3;p4.19">Firms in this market compete on non price, for example. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.19">Consumers in the market are looking for a luxury vehicle and therefore have money to spare, enough to buy into a brand name purely because of its reputation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.19">The control over price in the market is therefore limited mainly by the firm's reputation. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0342e-fig.001"/>
<p n="p5.19">
<s n="s1.4;p5.19">The main order winners and qualifiers for Jaguar are its heritage. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.19">They have an outstanding reputation for quality and racing. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.19">However its heritage does limit its market by only appealing to the older generation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.19">Demand in this market is price elastic as the products are luxury items; demand is responsive to a change in price. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.19">
<s n="s1.2;p6.19">The concentration pie chart opposite shows that the market is indeed an oligopoly. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.19">Jaguar holds 11.02% of the market concentration, 3 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> in the market. </s>

<p n="p7.19">
<s n="s1.4;p7.19">Within this market there are adversarial relationships between firms and therefore there is no collusion. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.19">This creates a zero sum game. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.19">BMW, the most powerful member of the market receives the largest share of the profit, whist poor performers, such as Jaguar lose business. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.19">There is a finite profit available to the supply chain. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.19">
<s n="s1.2;p8.19">Ford's premier automotive group is a small exception to this, as within the group, collusion occurs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.19">The firms within the group are as follows; Aston Martin, Volvo, Jaguar, and Land Rover. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.19">
<s n="s1.3;p9.19">As the market competes on non price, promotional activity is rife. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.19">Promotions such as free optional extras (satellite navigation, leather seats, etc) help to boost sales. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.19">Advertisements in automotive magazines, by the roadside and on television are also common. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.19">
<s n="s1.4;p10.19">Research and development is practiced by all companies to be at the forefront of technology. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.19">New designs also have to be researched to keep up with the changing trends in design. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.19">The industry is high tech, requiring the most accurate and fast machines available. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.19">This inadvertently excludes new entrants due to the high cost of research and build of these machines. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p11.19">Jaguar has not performed well. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.19">From the table in page 1, a loss of £601million can be seen. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.19">The net profit (profit/turnover) for Jaguar in 2003 was -24.7%. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.19">From the graph opposite showing net profit, Jaguar can be seen to be falling far behind other firms in the market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.19">
<s n="s1.3;p12.19">The main reason for Jaguar's poor performance is the fact that they export a lot of product to the US. At the start of the year, the exchange rate was $1.6 to the £. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.19">This meant that if Jaguar sold a car for £40,000 in the UK it would cost $64,000 in the US. As the price of the car in $ could not increase (this would result in a decrease in sales), the car would have to be sold for $64,000 at the end of the year when the £ was worth $1.8. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.19">Therefore, at the end of the year, Jaguar would be selling the car for £4,500 less relatively in the US than at the start of the year. </s>

<p n="p13.19">
<s n="s1.2;p13.19">Jaguar's current ratio is very low, suggesting that the firm is not in good financial health, if their obligations came due they probably could not repay them. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.19">However other firms in the market have much higher current ratios. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.19">
<s n="s1.2;p14.19">All is not lost however as Ford invested $2.1billion in jaguar in 2004. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.19">This infusion of capital will allow Jaguar to produce new models, advertise more and possibly make a profit by 2007. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Most viable strategy for a new entrant</head>
<p n="p15.19">
<s n="s1.2;p15.19">A new entrant to the luxury car market would need to compete via differentiation and focus differentiation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.19">To compete with firms such as jaguar, who produce high cost, luxury, quality products a new entrant would need to produce products of the same or better quality, but with a unique quality to the product they produce to differentiate themselves from the rest of the market. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0342e-pic.002"/>
<p n="p16.19">
<s n="s1.1;p16.19">The luxury automotive market spans from companies such as BMW, to companies like Ferrari and Lamborghini, producing top of the range vehicles. </s>

<p n="p17.19">
<s n="s1.2;p17.19">To compete with these companies a new entrant would have to compete via focus differentiation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.19">A small number of high quality products would need to be produced and an amazing reputation built. </s>

<p n="p18.19">
<s n="s1.4;p18.19">Acquiring Jaguar and making a profit is possible. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.19">Out-sourcing factories to America to avoid the dependence on the exchange rate would be beneficial. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.19">However, as Jaguar's heritage lies in Britain this could damage the company's image. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.19">Reducing the number of employees and focusing on new technology could also increase profits. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.19">
<s n="s1.4;p19.19">Jaguar's reputation is bought with the company. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.19">A reputation such as Jaguar's takes decades to build. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.19">This is the main reason why I would advise upon the acquisition of Jaguar. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.19">Major changes to the company would need to be made, but large profits are possible after they have been implemented. </s>
