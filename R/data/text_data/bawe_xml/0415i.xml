<s n="s1.4;p1.14">Supramolecular interactions as described by Lehn [1] and discussed by Marsh [2] offer synthetic chemists access to a vast array of materials with novel properties. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.14">Supramolecular polymers, where monomers are connected non-covalently, allow the materials formed to exhibit advantages over traditionally covalently bonded species. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p1.14">pH change, thermal stimuli [3]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.1;p2.14">Hydrogels, formed by an elastic network whose interstitial spaces are filled with water are used extensively as biomaterials [4]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.14">
<s n="s1.8;p3.14">Recent work in the field of synthesising biologically active materials as a route to drug delivery combines these two areas to produce supramolecular hydrogels with novel properties. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.14">Hydrogels based on an amino acid derivative that could release water soluble drugs and related molecules in a controlled manner on heating were first reported by Kiyonaka <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.14">[5] in June 2002. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.14">Later that year, Xing <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.14">[6] reported the first gelator based on the antibiotic Vancomycin (Van). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.14">Their pyrene derivative of Van formed a non-covalent polymer. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.14">In balancing the hydrophobic interactions of the pyrene rings (π-π stacking) and the hydrogen bonding ability of Van, they created a stable hydrogel. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.14">They hoped such a material would be used to treat infectious wounds or of use as an antiseptic matrix. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.14">
<s n="s1.4;p4.14">Efforts to design a hydrogel that forms part of a drug delivery system inspired Zhang <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.14">to conduct their research into supramolecular hydrogels that responds to ligand-receptor interaction. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.14">Whilst synthesising a short peptide hydrogelator, they noticed the intermediate Fmoc-protected D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide formed hydrogels efficiently. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.14">They proceeded to synthesise a range of analogous molecules from commercially available protected amino acids and investigated their gelation properties. </s>

<p n="p5.14">
<s n="s1.3;p5.14">The dipeptides <hi rend="bold">1</hi>-<hi rend="bold">5</hi> (scheme <hi rend="bold">1</hi>) produced hydrogels with increasing minimum concentrations (<hi rend="bold">1</hi> being the most efficient gelator at 3.6mM; <hi rend="bold">5</hi> the least efficient at 52mM) at pH3. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.14">Emission spectra were used to elucidate the nature of the non-covalent interactions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.14">In particular, peaks in the spectra of <hi rend="bold">1</hi> and <hi rend="bold">2</hi> suggested that the fluorene rings overlapped in an anti-parallel fashion - this hydrophobic interaction along with the intermolecular amide hydrogen bonding produced the supramolecular polymer necessary for gelation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.14">
<s n="s1.6;p6.14">It was well known from previous work by Whitesides and others [7], delivered by Marsh [2], that Van binds to particular dipeptides with particular affinities. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.14">It was shown that the hydrogel of <hi rend="bold">1</hi> (containing the D-Ala-D-Ala sequence) was efficiently disrupted by addition of even 0.01eq. of the Van hydrochloride salt. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.14">In contrast, <hi rend="bold">2</hi>, the enantiomer of <hi rend="bold">1</hi> (containing L-Ala-L-Ala) showed essentially no response on addition of 1eq. of Van. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.14">This agrees with previous work on the enantiomeric specificity of Van [8]. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.14">Circular dichorism (CD) was used to confirm the chiral differences of monomers <hi rend="bold">1</hi> and <hi rend="bold">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.14">This represents the most important discovery in this work - that a hydrogel can be destroyed by ligand binding purely based on stereochemistry. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.14">
<s n="s1.1;p7.14">It was proposed, based on emission spectra, that the gel-sol phase transition was caused by the hydrogen bonding of Van to the D-Ala-D-Ala sequence, this disrupting the fluorene π-π stacking interactions essential for the supramolecular polymer network in the gel (scheme <hi rend="bold">2</hi>). </s>

<head>Scheme <hi rend="bold">2 </hi>
</head>
</figure>
<p n="p8.14">
<s n="s1.2;p8.14">Scanning Electron Micrographs were used to show the effects of Van addition on the hydrogel networks. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.14">Whereas the nanofibre matrix of <hi rend="bold">1</hi> was destroyed by Van addition, the matrix of <hi rend="bold">2</hi> was unaffected - Van precipitated onto the matrix. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.14">
<s n="s1.4;p9.14">This research not only advanced the particular field of bioactive hydrogel materials but opened up a new avenue of research in drug delivery. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.14">Indeed, research in this area has built upon the conclusions of this paper and been published in other well respected journals such as <hi rend="italic">Chemical Communications.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.14">Reports include hydrogels based upon a class of anti-inflammatory drugs closely related in structure to the protected dipeptides described here [9]; and hydrogel materials containing complexing agents for the treatment of uranium poisoning in wounds [10]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.14">It is clear that the material covered in the paper is of high scientific value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.14">
<s n="s1.3;p10.14">The Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) is well read by chemists; with more article cites than any other journal in 2004 [11]. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.14">JACS communications are designed to be concise reports of work that the authors feel should be delivered with some immediacy to a general audience. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.14">This paper is easy and enjoyable to read and conveys the necessary information clearly and concisely in the style expected in JACS. It deals with a fundamental area of chemistry, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. ligand-receptor interaction, so is likely to be of interest to a majority of the readership of the journal. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.14">
<s n="s1.4;p11.14">We are presented with a report that gives a logical argument for the conclusions made based on the evidence shown. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.14">However the evidence provided alone is not conclusive. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.14">The supporting information gives details of synthesis and the procedures employed to test the responses of the hydrogels. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.14">Unfortunately, no information or data is given regarding why the authors decided on the proposed mechanism of disruption of the hydrogels by Van. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.14">
<s n="s1.3;p12.14">Figure 1 in the paper gives a CD and emission spectrum of the hydrogels <hi rend="bold">1</hi> and <hi rend="bold">2</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.14">Rather than conveying much scientific meaning, these simply illustrate the text. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.14">It would be appropriate for data such as these to be available as supporting information for closer inspection. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.14">
<s n="s1.3;p13.14">We are told that further study is underway on the relationship between monomer structure and gelation properties. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.14">The paper suggests that the hydrogels are formed by a combination of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, but no convincing evidence is given for either of these interactions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.14">NMR nOe data on monomer interaction would support the claims made more solidly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.2;p14.14">In summary, this work represents a significant step forward in this field toward creation of a novel drug delivery system. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.14">This paper's publication in JACS is well justified, although more evidence to support the conclusions made would be welcomed. </s>
