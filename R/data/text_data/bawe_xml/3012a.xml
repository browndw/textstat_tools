<hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> by Daniel Defoe was published in 1719 and is sometimes regarded as the first novel in English. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.21">However, as Kristeva poited out in 1960's when she coined the word 'intertextuality', "any text is the absorption and transformation of another".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.001"/> Daniel Defoe was inspired by the life of Alexander Selkirk who remained a castaway for almost thirty years after being marooned on a remote island. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.21">It follows that Defoe's novel is not the beginning of the 'Crusoe adventure' and it is certaily not the end. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.21">A great number of writers were inspired by the eighteenth-century novelist such as J. M. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.21">Coetzee with <hi rend="italic">Foe</hi> (1986) or Diana Souhami with <hi rend="italic">Selkirk's Island</hi> (2001). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.21">Many writers have 're-written' <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> and it is also the aim of the following piece of work. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.21">The idea is to produce a short text which 're-visits' the myth of Crusoe. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.21">The composition is completed by a commentary which explains how ideas for my re-writing came and evolved, how I made choices and which strategies I resorted to. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.21">The commentary then focuses on important issues brought up by the composition and finally reviews other possibilities that could have been explored. </s>

<s n="s1.13;p2.21">The initial seed of my rewriting came from the very title of the assignment's case study: 'Revisiting Crusoe's Island'. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p2.21">The term 'revisiting' implied going back to the island. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p2.21">In the edition of <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> which is divided into chapters, the last chapter is entitled "I Revisit My Island".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.002"/> At the end of the novel, Defoe's hero briefly returns to his island. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p2.21">As a consequence, I thought that Crusoe could not be used as the 'revisitor' since it would have been his re-revisit. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p2.21">It was the island which had to be revisited - visited by someone else. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p2.21">At that point, I came to the idea that a new protagonist could come to the island several years after Crusoe's took his leave and found what is left of the "eight and twenty Years, two Months, and 19 Days"<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.003"/> that Crusoe spent in his own "Country", his "own meer Property".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.004"/> This new 'visitor' would not be acquainted with the existence of Crusoe, so that the re-writing could focus on suppositions and hypotheses. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p2.21">He would be confronted to the signs of Robinson's stay and would have to speculate about their meaning. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p2.21">I had now to find who this "visitor" could be. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p2.21">I first thought of 'creating' him. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p2.21">The action had to take place in the 1720's or 1730's, it means around forty years after Crusoe's departure. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p2.21">It could hardly be after since Robinson Crusoe's 'traces', his habitations, his constructions, his "home-made" objects had to be in a reasonably good state to be recognizable and worth wondering about. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p2.21">The 'visitor' had to stop on the island, it could be for diverse reasons: collecting victuals for his ship, a colonial expedition or a naturalist exploration such as Darwin's in the Galapagos. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p2.21">However, the project evolved differently. </s>

<s n="s1.16;p3.21">It occurred to me that instead of 'creating' a character, I could borrow one from another novel, one whose story gave the opportunity to visit an island. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p3.21">The idea of my project was now to blend and fuse two novels. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p3.21">The status of my re-writing would be a kind of intertextual hybrid. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p3.21">I would "recast two (...) related texts in a new textual mould".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.005"/> However, I would only produce a mixture; I would remould my chosen novel in order to introduce allusions to <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p3.21">Two titles came into my mind: Swift's <hi rend="italic">Gulliver Travels</hi> (1726) and Stevenson's <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> (1881). </s>
<s n="s6.16;p3.21">I had now to make a choice. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p3.21">Swift's hero bears several similarities with Defoe's. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p3.21">Gulliver's ship is caught in a storm and although the hero's companions die, he manages to survive and reaches an island, the country of the Lilliputs. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p3.21">Later in the novel, Gulliver is marooned by the sailors of his ship who turned up to be pirates. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p3.21">It is reminiscent of Diana Souhami's "original Robinson Crusoe", Selkirk, who was marooned on a remote island.<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.006"/> Concerning time, the two novels work very well since Gulliver's last travel, in the country of the Houyhnhnms takes place in 1715. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p3.21">Consequently, Gulliver's "Voyage to the island of Robinson Crusoe" could happen set just after, in 1716, which means thirty three years after Crusoe's departure. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p3.21">However, in terms of genre, the two novels are quite different. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p3.21">As some critics pointed out, Defoe's work gives an illusion of reality. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p3.21">Leslie Stephen argued that the novel was "in one sense marvellously like truth"<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.007"/>, his daughter, Virginia Woolf underlined that "Reality, fact, substance" dominated the story.<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.008"/> As for Ian Watt, he wrote that "when the story appeared it is reported to have been universally received and credited as a genuine story".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.009"/> On the contrary, Swift's novel is fantastic and unrealistic. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p3.21">Crusoe's ordinary island would have rung false compared to the Lilliputs, the giants and the flying island of Gulliver's voyages. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p3.21">As a consequence, I turned to <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.16;p4.21">Stevenson's story shares many issues with Defoe's. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p4.21">Both novelists describe their islands in detail. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p4.21">In terms of wildlife and vegetation, they are different. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p4.21">Crusoe finds in his island "many pleasant Savana's or Meadows; plain, smooth and cover'd with Grass (...), a great deal of Tobacco (...), Sugar Canes"<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.010"/> and he is pleased to observe that there is "no wild Beasts to hurt [him]"<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.011"/>, whereas "oak-like tress", "swampy willows" or "pines" grow on Treasure Island and there are also "snakes".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.012"/> Nevertheless, the general descriptions of the two islands are very similar. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p4.21">Both novelists focus on their hilly landscapes. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p4.21">For his first exploration of the island, Crusoe decides to go to a hill "which rose up very steep and high, and which seem'd to over-top some other Hills"<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.013"/> and he decides to build his habitation in "a little Plain on the side of a rising Hill." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.014"/>
<s n="s7.16;p4.21">As for <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>, the first description of it focuses on "two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.015"/> A link could also be drawn between the characters of Robinson Crusoe and Ben Gunn. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p4.21">The latter has been marooned just as Selkirk and has lived "on goats since then"<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.016"/> like Defoe's Crusoe. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p4.21">Both have made little boats. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p4.21">In terms of time, the combination of the two novels was interesting. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p4.21">Stevenson is very vague about the precise year of the treasure hunt. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p4.21">His narrator, Jim Hawkins, mentions only that "I take up the pen in the year of the grace 17--, and go back to the time when my father kept the 'Admiral Benbow' inn." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s13.16;p4.21">This vagueness was an opportunity to seize for my intertextual re-writing since I felt entitled to situate <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> in the 1720's, about forty years after Crusoe's departure. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p4.21">Similarly, Stevenson does not mention where Treasure Island is situated, consequently, I could give it the same location as Crusoe's island, "near the Spanish dominions" of America.<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.018"/> Finally, in matters of narration, both novels are retrospectively told. </s>

<s n="s1.30;p6.21">This re-writing had several aims. </s>
<s n="s2.30;p6.21">The main target was the shift in matters of point of view and narration. </s>
<s n="s3.30;p6.21">In this project, the hero of Defoe becomes a very minor character since he is only mentioned in an anecdote. </s>
<s n="s4.30;p6.21">It follows a complex narrational process. </s>
<s n="s5.30;p6.21">The re-writing brings into play three actual writers - Defoe, Stevenson and myself, and two fictional writers - Crusoe as the writer of his bibliography, Jim as the writer of his adventure and as the writer of Crusoe's story. </s>
<s n="s6.30;p6.21">Two narrators are competing; Jim as a 'verbal' narrator since he is still given a voice and Robinson as a 'silent' narrator since he is no longer narrating his story but his fictional autobiography, Defoe's novel, is still present in the reader's mind. </s>
<s n="s7.30;p6.21">Finally, there are two levels of narration: Jim's adventure and Crusoe's story. </s>
<s n="s8.30;p6.21">Not only Crusoe is no longer the one who speaks but his story is told by someone else. </s>
<s n="s9.30;p6.21">Jim is the main narrator of <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> and it fell on him to find Crusoe's cave and describe it. </s>
<s n="s10.30;p6.21">Consequently, Robinson's world is seen by another person. </s>
<s n="s11.30;p6.21">Jim had to imagine, to make suppositions about the whys and the wherefores. </s>
<s n="s12.30;p6.21">In that respect, the rewriting had to conform to Jim's narrative style. </s>
<s n="s13.30;p6.21">I therefore studied the narration of <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> and wrote the Crusoe's anecdote in conformity with the rest of the story. </s>
<s n="s14.30;p6.21">For example, I kept Jim's use of the grammatical shifter "here". </s>
<s n="s15.30;p6.21">Even if he writes some years after the events happened and if he is no longer on the island, Jim uses the term "here" as if the events were happening as he tells them. </s>
<s n="s16.30;p6.21">I found it interesting and worth maintaining. </s>
<s n="s17.30;p6.21">Similarly, I borrowed some of Jim's words and expressions. </s>
<s n="s18.30;p6.21">Just before the passage that I chose to incorporate my rewriting, Stevenson's hero sees his end near and writes "It was all over, I thought".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.020"/> I gave an echo to Jim's words when I wrote "I thought, maybe it was not all over". </s>
<s n="s19.30;p6.21">Moreover, earlier in the novel, Jim writes "then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives".<ref target="BAWE_3012a-ftnote.021"/> This is the reason why I chose to put the sentence "another notion came into my head". </s>
<s n="s20.30;p6.21">Finally, my project explores the notion of time. </s>
<s n="s21.30;p6.21">About forty years are meant to separate Crusoe's story and Jim's visit of the island. </s>
<s n="s22.30;p6.21">Consequently, I had to focus on the state of Robinson Crusoe's habitation after many years of abandon. </s>
<s n="s23.30;p6.21">I thus tried to emphasis the idea of decay and rottenness. </s>
<s n="s24.30;p6.21">I presented the construction which is situated in front of the cave -what Crusoe calls the 'tent', as destroyed. </s>
<s n="s25.30;p6.21">Except for deterioration, the place had to be similar to the way it had been built. </s>
<s n="s26.30;p6.21">Another issue concerning time was the blurring of chronology. </s>
<s n="s27.30;p6.21">
<hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> was written (1719) before <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> (1881). </s>
<s n="s28.30;p6.21">However, the composition assumes that Jim is going to write the story of Crusoe some years after his treasure hunt. </s>
<s n="s29.30;p6.21">As a consequence, <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> is meant to be written after <hi rend="italic"> Treasure Island.</hi> </s>
<s n="s30.30;p6.21">It is with all these ideas in mind that I composed and rewrote. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p7.21">However, after having completed my rewriting, I found several relevant elements that could have been added. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p7.21">I might have better explored Jim's internal thoughts and his wondering about what he finds in the cave. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p7.21">I could have taken this rewriting as an opportunity to underline the almost absurdness of Crusoe's fortification. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p7.21">Defoe's hero spends so much time in making sure that he can live in security that this part of the story almost becomes more important than his encounter with Friday. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p7.21">Moreover, as the assignment only required a short rewriting, I had to select only one passage and I chose to focus on the habitation. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p7.21">However, there are many other ideas that I wish I could have developed. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p7.21">I thought that Jim or Ben Gunn could have found the traces of Crusoe's plantation or his goat-fences and speculate on them. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p7.21">I could have used Souhami and Coetzee's novels. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p7.21">I only resorted to the Souhami text in my epilogue when I mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Cinque Ports</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p7.21">Defoe does not provide his readers with the name of Crusoe's ship, so I had to find one as was necessary for my denouement. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p7.21">I also used Souhami's book when I referred to Richard Steele. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p7.21">As for the Coetzee text, it was useful insofar as I did not feel guilty to 'kill' Crusoe since it is also what the South African novelist did. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.21">
<s n="s1.6;p8.21">To conclude, this re-writing has been a new and enriching experience. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.21">First it allowed me to revisit a myth, <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi>, and to remould it. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.21">Secondly, it entitled me to realize what I have often wished to do. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.21">Many times, I have finished a novel, felt disappointed by the end and imagined an alternative ending. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.21">I have now understood that I am not was a 'fussy' reader. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.21">Intervening in others novels is in fact common practise even among many renowned novelists. </s>

<hi rend="bold italic"> All this while, as I say, I was still running, and, without taking any notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks, and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart, and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty, some nearer seventy, feet high. The air, too, smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh. </hi>
