<s n="s1.2;p44.47">During all 4 runs, the concentration of iodide can be assumed to be constant due to the regular addition of thiosulphate, so reducing the iodine formed back to iodide. </s>

<p n="p45.47">
<s n="s1.2;p45.47">Runs 1 and 2 (half the iodide concentration, half the pseudo-first order rate constant) showed the reaction to be 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> order w.r.t to I- and thus, 2nd order overall. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p45.47">The mechanism discussed in the introduction is a valid proposal. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.47">
<s n="s1.5;p46.47">The difficulty in determining the initial concentration of peroxide will have been a significant source of error for the actual [H <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O <hi rend="sub">2</hi>] calculation. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p46.47">Reaction flask 1 had been left to stand for 2 hours, and flask 3 for 1.25 hours as well as being heated for 20mins. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p46.47">It was assumed all the peroxide had been used up by then. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p46.47">However, during this 'infinite time' titration, even after periods as long as 20mins, the blue colour would reappear; due to time limits in the laboratory, there had to be a cut-off point. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p46.47">This would not affect the values of the calculated rate constant since the gradient of ln(A/c) against time will have been the same. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.47">
<s n="s1.3;p47.47">The linear regression equation used for calculating the Arrhenius parameters was based on 3 measurements. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p47.47">For a more precise and accurate determination of the collision frequency factor A, and activation energy E, the experiment would need to be repeated at many more temperatures. </s>
