<s n="s3.6;p3.10">This could be read as an implication that the idealised notion of American citizens as open, progressive and liberal was in fact deceptive. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.10">The Mexican War and slavery demonstrated that freedom and equality was far from available for all, prompting much questioning regarding the type of people and nation being built. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.10">Alliterative consonance coupled with fricative sibilance in statements such as; 'this I thought and this I think,' generates a sinister hissing sound that effectively mirrors the consistent reverberation of remorse through the narrator's mind. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.10">The overwhelming paranoia that drives the protagonist to madness, may be indicative of the guilt of a nation haunted by its wrongs and fortifies the legitimacy of Walker's previously cited statement.<ref target="BAWE_3008e-ftnote.007"/> But, Poe's Southern origin implies a probable tendency towards the acceptance of slavery, making such deductions questionable. </s>

<s n="s2.9;p4.10">Poe's repeated use of mirroring and doubling suggests that an absolute definition is unattainable. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.10">'Ligeia''s central thematic preoccupation with interchangeable personalities could be read as representational of Poe's possible belief in a fractured and confused American identity. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.10">Throughout the tale we remain uncertain of both Ligeia's existence and identity; she metamorphoses into Rowena and is even suggested be one with the narrator; 'did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3008e-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s5.9;p4.10">Enumerable manifestations of one person may reflect the overlapping, paradoxical versions of the American character that existed and consequential complexity of defining the self if it exists in multiple form. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.10">America was yet to forge an authoritative sense of history and society from which to establish a secure model of American identity, something partly attributable for its undeniably ruptured cultural character. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.10">The text may therefore be raising questions regarding how formative one's sense of country and national identity is. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.10">Interpreting 'Ligeia' as an allegory for unstable identity supports Wald's belief that; 'The reader is drawn into.. a world of uncertainty that may be either supernatural or psychological. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3008e-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s4.7;p5.10">As with 'The Tell Tale Heart', palpable instability and distorted reality leaves the reader struggling to ascertain what is true, a constructive confusion that aids our understanding of the disturbed psyche, the predominant focus of Poe's work. </s>
