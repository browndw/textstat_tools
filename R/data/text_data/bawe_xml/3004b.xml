<p n="p22.22">
<s n="s1.10;p22.22">After analysing <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> insofar as their perception of male and female characters is concerned, one can conclude that they construct gender as well as certain gender roles. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p22.22">As this essay has pointed out, the way of doing this is different in Virginia Woolf's work to that of Ford Madox Ford's novel. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p22.22">The images and themes used by the authors vary or appear at a different level of intensity. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p22.22">Of course, the authors are referring to their own experiences concerning gender and gender roles. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p22.22">Therefore, the fact that one book was written by a man, whereas the other one was written by a woman may have had an influence. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p22.22">Where Ford offers a rather negative perception of women, who were the cause of Edward's destruction, Woolf portrays women in conflict with society. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p22.22">As the war demanded certain gender roles, the perception of gender might also have changed in <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> in contrast to <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi>, a book which was written beforehand. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p22.22">Although <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi> pushes acceptable public boundaries, the presentation of gender and gender roles is more obvious and definitely stronger in <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi>. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p22.22">However, since 'the modern period is a period of profound and marked changes in the social structure and in the psychic structures of men'<ref target="BAWE_3004b-ftnote.070"/>, both authors use certain descriptions of love, affairs, relationships and married life as well as generation differences in order to construct their ideas of gender. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p22.22">Beside the main characters, the minor ones, such as Nancy Rufford, as well as other characters in <hi rend="italic">Mrs Dalloway</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Good Soldier</hi>, offer interesting perceptions and in general also contribute to the construction of gender and gender roles, but due to limitations of space they could only be briefly mentioned. </s>
