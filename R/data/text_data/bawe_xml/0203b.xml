<p n="p73.82">
<s n="s1.3;p73.82">Major studies have shown the benefits of carotid endarterectomy as compared to medical therapy in symptomatic patients with a carotid artery stenosis of 70% or greater - with only eight carotid endarterectomies needed to prevent one stroke in symptomatic patients. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p73.82">Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of disabling stroke or death in patients with stenosis exceeding 70% (ECST) or 50% (NASCET) [1]. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p73.82">However, this result is only applicable to surgically-fit patients operated on by surgeons with low complication rates (less than 6%) (Cochrane). </s>
</p>
<p n="p74.82">
<s n="s1.4;p74.82">The optimum time for surgery in these patients is 2 weeks after the patients last symptoms, however, the chance of a patient being admitted for theatre within this time period is minimal. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p74.82">Trans cranial Doppler is used to assess microemboli, a high load of which is associated with early carotid thrombosis and increased risk of stroke. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p74.82">The <name type="other"/> hospital cardiovascular unit has pioneered a treatment for recurrent TIA's which involves the administration of trans-cranial directed anti platelet drugs to control the number of micro emboli. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p74.82">This treatment aims to reduce the risk of stroke until the patient can be treated safely on the next surgical elective list [2]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p75.82">
<s n="s1.8;p75.82">Initially <name type="other"/>'s operation was performed under local anaesthetic, unfortunately this had to be changed to general anaesthetic as <name type="other"/> lost consciousness once the arteries were clamped. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p75.82">Local anesthesia has the advantage of allowing direct evaluation of the patient's neurologic status without sophisticated monitoring. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p75.82">This enables the surgeon to operate on the majority of patients without the need for a shunt which may pose an increased risk of stroke to the patient. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p75.82">General anaesthesia has the advantage of improved airway control and patient comfort during prolonged operations. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p75.82">However, it does require the use of routine or selected shunting, and selective shunting requires the use of some form of cerebral monitoring to assess the need for a shunt i.e. transcranial Doppler. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p75.82">There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy performed under local and general anaesthetic [3]. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p75.82">Evidence from non-randomised studies suggests potential benefits with the use of local anaesthetic. </s>
