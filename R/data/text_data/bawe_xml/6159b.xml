<s n="s1.6;p1.22">A Petters ACI four-stroke diesel engine is used. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.22">The four-stroke cycle, as it suggests, consists of four stages; air intake, compression, fuel injection &amp; combustion and exhaust. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.22">Unlike the petrol four-stroke cycle that compresses a fuel and air mixture, the diesel cycle compresses only the air. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.22">The heat from this compression ignites the diesel upon injection, rather than providing a spark to ignite the fuel as in a petrol engine. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.22">For this reason a diesel engine has a higher compression ratio than a petrol engine, as high as 25:1 compared to 12:1 of a petrol engine. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.22">This higher compression ratio also enables the diesel engine to have a higher efficiency than a petrol engine. </s>

<p n="p13.22">
<s n="s1.2;p13.22">Graph 17 shows that as the load on the engine increased the brake power increased. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.22">The friction power was assumed to be constant over the applied load range for each fuel therefore the indicated power increased at the same rate as the brake power, (I.P. = B.P. + F.P.). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.22">
<s n="s1.7;p14.22">Graph 18 (Page 7) shows that, as the brake power increased the fuel consumption increased. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.22">This was true for both the fuels, however the bio-diesel fuel consumption rate was greater than the mineral diesel. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.22">This is because the bio-diesel has a lower L.C.V. than the mineral diesel. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.22">By extrapolating the graphs back to the x-axis the intercept gave the friction power (aka friction loss) within the engine. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.22">The friction power within the engine for mineral diesel was 1.7kW and 1.5kW for bio-diesel. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.22">These friction powers are shown on Graph 17 represented within the indicated power. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p15.22">This is because it takes x amount of fuel to 'turn' the engine and x to turn it with a bit more force. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.22">Both fuels followed the same trend but the bio-diesel used more fuel in doing so. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.22">This again is because of the relatively low L.C.V. of bio-diesel. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.22">
<s n="s1.2;p16.22">The air fuel ratio decreased as the B.M.E.P. increased (Graph 20, Page 9). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.22">This is because more fuel was required to drive the engine at higher B.M.E.P.'s while the air intake remained approximately constant. </s>

<head rend="underlined">2.4 Energy Balance &amp; Usage Throughout the System:</head>

<s n="s2.4;p17.22">(Graph 21, Page 10). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.22">This was because, as more fuel was being burnt more heat was being produced. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.22">The bio-diesel gave more air cooling losses because more energy was being supplied (see dashed lines on graph). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.22">
<s n="s1.4;p18.22">Graph 22 (Page 11) shows the energy usage throughout the system as a % of the heat supplied by the fuel. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.22">The vast majority of the supplied heat was wasted in the exhaust, air cooling and other energy losses (other losses included noise, vibration etc.). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.22">This was very similar for both fuels. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.22">This wastage of energy is expressed in the efficiencies as discussed below. </s>

<head rend="underlined">2.5 Engine Efficiencies:</head>
<p n="p19.22">
<s n="s1.5;p19.22">Graph 23 (Page 12) shows the brake thermal, indicated thermal and mechanical efficiencies of the engine running on both fuels. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.22">The mechanical efficiencies for both the mineral and bio-diesel rose from zero to approximately 70% over their full working range. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.22">The bio-diesel constantly had a slightly better efficiency, about 2%, over its entire range. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.22">However the bio-diesel couldn't work under as high a load as the mineral diesel. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.22">The reason for bio-diesel having a better mechanical efficiency is because of its better lubricating properties, not as much energy was used to overcome the friction within the engine. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.22">
<s n="s1.4;p20.22">The indicated thermal efficiency for both fuels was very similar reaching a maximum of approximately 20% with the mineral diesel being slightly higher over the complete range (about 4-6% higher). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.22">Both fuels started to decrease at their maximum working loads. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.22">Mineral diesel had an overall higher indicated efficiency because this efficiency measure ignores the mechanical (frictional) losses within the engine. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.22">So because mineral diesel had a higher friction power (thus used more of the supplied energy to drive the engine) it also had a higher indicated efficiency. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.22">
<s n="s1.3;p21.22">The brake thermal efficiency of both fuels was almost identical up to about 300kPa of B.M.E.P. where the mineral diesel continued to rise and the bio-diesel levelled off. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.22">Both fuels rose from zero percent at 0kPa with mineral diesel hitting a peak of 23% and bio-diesel 19% both at approximately 500kPa. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.22">The reason for mineral diesel having a slightly better efficiency is because it converted a higher % of the heat supplied into brake power. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">3.0 Conclusions:</head>
<p n="p22.22">
<s n="s1.6;p22.22">Overall bio-diesel performed very well compared to mineral diesel. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p22.22">Positives for bio-diesel were its lower friction power due to its superior lubricating properties and its higher levels of mechanical efficiency. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.22">On the down side it could not perform at high levels of load and it had a lower indicated thermal efficiency. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.22">However indicated thermal efficiency is not a very useful gauge of performance as it ignores mechanical losses. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.22">Where brake thermal efficiency was concerned it performed to just about an equal level as mineral diesel. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.22">With all the above points in mind and the environmental benefits of bio-diesel it could substitute for mineral diesel as a transport fuel very well. </s>
