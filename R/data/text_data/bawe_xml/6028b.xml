<p n="p1.25">
<s n="s1.6;p1.25">Discourse Analysis looks at language in terms of social interaction. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.25">According to Michael McCarthy (1991), "discourse analysis is a vast subject area within linguistics, encompassing [...] the analysis of spoken and written language over and above concerns such as the structure of the clause or sentence" (p. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.25">32). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.25">However, this paper focuses only on written discourse by analysing a text based on two main approaches: cohesion and thematization. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.25">Particularly, the discussion begins with a brief outline of the context of the sample, followed by an exposition of the two approaches based on background literature. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.25">Then, it moves on to a detailed analysis of the text and finally concludes with the limitations of the analysis. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">B. CONTEXT OF DISCOURSE</head>
<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.1;p2.25">To begin with, the features that are important with regards to the context of discourse are the following: channel, formality, purpose, relationship between the addressor and the addressee, topic and setting. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.25">
<s n="s1.2;p3.25">Here, the channel is written and has the form of a formal letter including the addresses' full address, the date, and the formulaic opening and closing expressions: "Dear Mr Miller" and "Yours Sincerely". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.25">However, it is a genuine charity letter signed by a well-known game show host celebrity, aiming to personalize it and sensitise the addressee to provide financial help to the leukaemic children. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.25">
<s n="s1.4;p4.25">What is striking about its format is that it has a title and a subtitle accompanied by a visual image of two children. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.25">The title is in bold letters that easily catch the reader's attention, whereas the words "children" and "leukaemia" are capitalized, stressing the children's difficult state. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.25">The subtitle "inaugurated by Princess" gives value to those people's work and the phrase "no 298405" reveals that it is really a general letter sent to many people, yet easy to become personalized by the addition of the addressee's name. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.25">Finally, the names given in the right column, as well as the "P.S." and the sketch next to the signature add to the letter's general purpose of persuasion. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">C. LITERATURE REVIEW-COHESION</head>
<p n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.2;p5.25">This part of the paper presents a literary review of the first approach, followed by a justification for its selection. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.25">It then concludes with the analysis of the text. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.25">
<s n="s1.7;p6.25">There are many texts that, although they are grammatically correct, are not cohesive. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.25">Such texts lack connectivity between sequences and so readers face difficulty in deciphering their meaning. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.25">As McCarthy (1991) supports, "English offers a [...] set of options for creating surface links between the clauses and sentences of a text otherwise known as cohesion" (p. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.25">25). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.25">In addition, Halliday and Hasan's (1976) system (as cited in Hatch, 1992, p. 223) "distinguishes five major types of grammatical cohesive ties: reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction, and lexical ties." </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.25">These ties as Brown and Yule (1983) acknowledge: "bind a text together" (p. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.25">191). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.25">
<s n="s1.11;p7.25">As Thompson (1996) points out, "reference is a set of grammatical recourses that allow the speaker to indicate whether something is being repeated from somewhere earlier in the text" (p. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.25">180). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.25">It is binary: "the first [...] is known as exophoric ('pointing outwards') whereas the second is anaphoric ('pointing inwards') (Thompson, 1996, p. 181). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.25">The second cohesive tie is ellipsis, where "a clause [...] may be presupposed at a subsequent place in the text by the device of positive omission" (Halliday, 1985, p. 288). </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.25">The third, on the other hand, is substitution that takes place when "an expression may simply be replaced by another in the text" (Brown and Yule, 1983, p. 201). </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.25">The fourth type of cohesive tie is conjunction. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.25">According to Hatch (1992), "here are several different kinds of conjunctive relations: additive [...], adversative [...], causal [...] and temporal" (p. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.25">225). </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.25">The last type of cohesion is lexical cohesion. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.25">According to Brown and Yule (1983), "cohesion may be derived from lexical relationships like hyponymy [...], part-whole [...], collocability [...], clausal substitution [...], comparison [...] and by syntactic repetition" (p. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.25">194). </s>

</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">D. REASONS FOR CHOOSING COHESION</head>
<p n="p8.25">
<s n="s1.5;p8.25">Before proceeding to the analysis of the text based on cohesion, it is necessary to mention the reasons for selecting it. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.25">Firstly, as it is clear by the pertinent review, many linguists have studied this approach and perceive it as one of the main approaches for analysing written discourse. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.25">Furthermore, cohesion offers an insight into the meaning relations between the various elements of a text, as knowledge of the grammatical relations between words is not enough. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.25">Finally, according to Halliday (1985), "in order to construct discourse we need to be able to establish [...] relations that may involve elements of any extent [...] (and) this cannot be achieved by grammatical structure" (p. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.25">288). </s>

<hi rend="italic">E.1.1.</hi> <hi rend="italic">EXOPHORA</hi>
</head>
<p n="p9.25">
<s n="s1.11;p9.25">The forms, which according to Brown and Yule (1983) "direct the hearer or reader to look elsewhere for their interpretation" (p. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p9.25">192), are exophoric. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p9.25">For instance, phrases such as "seller and buyer" (l. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.25">14), "life" (l. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p9.25">1) do not refer to another item inside the text. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p9.25">On the contrary, they point to the outside world or make reference to things or people that are assumed as known by the addressee. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p9.25">Also the personal pronoun "I" (l. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p9.25">4) has an exophoric use as according to Thompson (1996), " 'I' means the person who is speaking now in the real world' rather than the person just referred to in the text'" (p. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p9.25">181). </s>
<s n="s10.11;p9.25">The phrase "CHILDREN with LEUKAEMIA" is also an example of exophora since it refers to the name of the institute that helps the children and not to the children themselves. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p9.25">(For more examples see Appendix 1). </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">E.1.2 ENDOPHORA</head>
<p n="p10.25">
<s n="s1.12;p10.25">The other type of reference is endophoric. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p10.25">According to Thompson (1996), "most cohesive endophoric reference is anaphoric ('pointing backwards')" (p. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p10.25">181). </s>
<s n="s4.12;p10.25">For instance, "they" (l. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p10.25">8) points back to the phrase "my friends" (l. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p10.25">7) and "your help" refers to "Mr Miller". </s>
<s n="s7.12;p10.25">The phrase "on their behalf" (l. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p10.25">21) refers to the "leukaemic children" (l. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p10.25">19), and "yourself" (l. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p10.25">17) refers to "you" (l. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p10.25">10). </s>
<s n="s12.12;p10.25">Thus, the writer resorts to the use of personal pronouns in order to avoid repetition. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.25">
<s n="s1.10;p11.25">Apart from anaphora, there is a second endophoric reference called cataphora. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p11.25">In this case, the cohesive ties point ahead so that a word or phrase is not specified until further on in the text. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p11.25">For instance, "child-killer disease" (l. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p11.25">4) points forwards to leukaemia (l. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p11.25">4). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p11.25">The word "help" (l. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p11.25">9) is an example of cataphora, since the addressor does not state the kind of help until later (ll.10, 11). </s>
<s n="s8.10;p11.25">Moreover, the word "other" (l. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p11.25">15) according to Thompson (1996), [is a] "comparative attached to one entity concept [and] thus implies the existence of the other entity / concept" (p. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p11.25">183). </s>
</p>
</div3>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">E.2. SUBSTITUTION</head>
<p n="p12.25">
<s n="s1.6;p12.25">Moving on to the second type of cohesion, substitution, one can trace in the text several entities that are replaced by others belonging to the same grammatical category. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.25">As Halliday (1985) suggests, "there are three main contexts for ellipsis and substitution in English. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.25">These are 1) the clause, 2) the verbal group and 3) the nominal group" (p. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.25">297). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.25">Hence, the phrase "do it" (l. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.25">8) replacing the verbal group in ll.7-8 "find the answers". </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">E.3. ELLIPSIS</head>
<p n="p13.25">
<s n="s1.8;p13.25">Compared to the one example of substitution, instances of ellipsis are easily evident throughout the text. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p13.25">For example: "which" implied for 'questions' (l. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p13.25">2), "for which" for 'disease' (l. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p13.25">4). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p13.25">Instances of verbal groups such as "my friends [are working]" (l. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p13.25">7), "perhaps [will] a friend [...?]" (l.10) are also ellipses from the text. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p13.25">Though they are omitted, the reader can easily guess the meaning of the elliptical words. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p13.25">(For further examples see Appendix 1). </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">E.4. CONJUNCTION</head>
<p n="p14.25">
<s n="s1.9;p14.25">The fourth type of cohesion is conjunction. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.25">This category includes logical connectors that help the writer to edit their text carefully. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.25">The connector "and" (l. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.25">5) adds more information to the sentence by referring to more than one element. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p14.25">The conjunction "but" (l. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p14.25">8) on the other hand, has the adversative role of showing that although people are trying hard, they cannot cure the disease. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.25">Also, "thanks to" (l. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.25">12) signifies a causal relationship between the two clauses. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p14.25">Finally, in lines 18-19 there is a causal - conditional relationship between Mr Miller's support of the addressor's appeal and the following result of ensuring the benefits of his actions. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined bold">E.5. LEXICAL COHESION</head>
<p n="p15.25">
<s n="s1.15;p15.25">Finally, various types of lexical cohesion link the text together and create a unified whole. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p15.25">To begin with, several words are repeated: "found" (ll. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p15.25">5, 6) and "answers"(ll. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p15.25">13, 15). </s>
<s n="s5.15;p15.25">Also, the word "child-killer disease" (l. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p15.25">4) is used as a synonym for "leukaemia" (l. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p15.25">4). </s>
<s n="s8.15;p15.25">Although the verbs "receive" and "win" are not really synonymous, in this particular context they act as such, since both refer to "prizes". </s>
<s n="s9.15;p15.25">Another type of lexical cohesion is hyponymy, as in: "disease and leukaemia". </s>
<s n="s10.15;p15.25">Besides, a cohesion tie that most writers prefer to use in their texts is collocation. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p15.25">This refers to words that go together in a context and complement each other such as "question-answers" (ll. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p15.25">2, 3), or antonyms "seller and the buyer" (l. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p15.25">14). </s>
<s n="s14.15;p15.25">Consequently, lexical cohesion allows the writer to play with words and enrich his text. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p15.25">(For more reference see Appendix 1). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.25">
<s n="s1.3;p16.25">As a result, this section of the paper has looked at how cohesive devices connect ideas within the text. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.25">By now it is clear that the interpretation of one item is based on the understanding of another. </s>

<head rend="bold">F. LITERATURE REVIEW -THEMATIZATION</head>
<p n="p17.25">
<s n="s1.5;p17.25">Thematization, focusing on the order of information in a sentence, is a different way of analysing a written text. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.25">The theme can be considered as the point of departure of the message (Halliday, 1985, p. 38). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.25">It can also be seen as that "which locates and orients the clause within its own context" (as cited in Thompson, 1996, p. 143). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.25">Halliday (1985) goes even further to provide a more extended definition of theme stating that " the theme of any clause, [...] extends up to [and includes] the topical Theme" (p. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.25">56). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.25">
<s n="s1.6;p18.25">There are several types of themes such as: subject or adjunct themes, thematizing structures and predicated themes. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.25">A theme can have three parts: a textual, an interpersonal and an ideational one. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.25">According to Matthiessen &amp; Painter (1997), "the textual and interpersonal stages to the Theme may or may not be present" (p. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.25">24). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.25">When they are present the order is "textual + interpersonal + ideational" (McCarthy, 1983, p.58). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.25">Also a theme can have three different statuses: unmarked (following a normal word order), marked (where something is put forward into the slot), and enhanced in thematizing structures. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.25">
<s n="s1.5;p19.25">The rheme, on the other hand, is the comment: "what the speaker states about, or in regard to, the starting point of the utterance" (as cited in Brown &amp; Yule, 1983, pp. 126-7). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.25">As Thompson (1996) suggests, " the rheme provides the content, the main information that the writer or speaker wants the addressee to know" (p. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.25">165). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.25">The rheme of the first sentence organizes the progression of topics in the structure of the text. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p20.25">So, any changes in them, signal a change in his perspective and way of looking at the text. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p20.25">Therefore, it is extremely important for a reader to know how to analyse a text in terms of this approach, in order to understand and evaluate the writer's ideas. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p20.25">Also, as Halliday (1985) reports, " the choice of clause Themes [...] constitutes what is often known as 'the method of development' of the text" (p. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p20.25">62). </s>

<head rend="bold">I. CONCLUSION</head>
<p n="p25.25">
<s n="s1.6;p25.25">To sum up, the primary purpose of this paper was to examine how the two main approaches of written discourse (cohesion and thematization) shed light on the way discourse works. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p25.25">However, there is another related approach to discourse analysis that this paper does not refer to, called clause relationships. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p25.25">This approach constitutes a first limitation of this study. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p25.25">A second limitation is that thematization brought up several difficulties in identifying the theme and rheme of each clause. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p25.25">The instances were not always clear-cut and thus allowed for various interpretations. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p25.25">However, besides these limitations, this paper leads to future study of other approaches of discourse analysis and the possible pedagogic implications these carry. </s>
