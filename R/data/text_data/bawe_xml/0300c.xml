<s n="s3.4;p1.29">The profit forecast will give an estimate of future performance at different levels of sales and at different selling prices, whilst the cash flow forecast will give an indication of the ability of the business to survive with or without additional funding or overdraft facility. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusions and Recommendations</head>
<p n="p27.29">
<s n="s1.3;p27.29">At the current forecast levels, the company is going to face bankruptcy unless it receives additional funding in the form of a loan, or a higher overdraft limit is allowed by the bank. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.29">In February the closing cash is -£13,150 yet the current overdraft limit is only £10,000. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.29">The problem becomes more severe in March and April and then slowly improves as sales increase. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.29">
<s n="s1.4;p28.29">A further problem is that the company is not going to have enough chairs to meet demand at the forecast levels. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.29">If it manufactures 200 chairs per month, then in May it will already have run out of chairs. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.29">The recommendation here is to alter the production schedule so that slightly more chairs are produced in the spring/summer months, and less in the autumn/winter months. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.29">Obviously this will affect the monthly costs of labour and purchases in the cash flow forecast, </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.29">
<s n="s1.5;p29.29">At a 10% higher sales price, the profit is greater for any given level of sales (as per the profit-volume graph). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p29.29">On the whole, larger amounts of cash will come into the company in the same space of time, and so the closing cash will be higher and also less overdraft (or loan) will be required. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p29.29">The margin of safety is also higher. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p29.29">The reverse is true if the sales price is 10% lower. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p29.29">Hence the recommendation is to increase the sales price, and also to obtain funding (or an increased overdraft limit) if the closing cash in any given month still exceeds the current overdraft limit. </s>
