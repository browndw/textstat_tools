<s n="s1.5;p1.21">Despite nearly two decades of the demand to legalise same-sex marriage in different countries, the issue still arouses intense passion and sometimes severe hostilities among the public and the political class. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.21">Infact, even within in the LGBT communities, the idea of same-sex marriage is an anathema to some while an aspiration among others. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.21">Though this issue concerns all the sexual minorities, the scope of the paper limits my concern only to gays and lesbians. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.21">This Paper tries to address the question whether the right to same-sex marriage would result in the elimination of discrimination against gays and lesbians or would it perpetuate and reinforce the oppressive heterosexual normative order through the institution of marriage while exploring the current discourse on gay rights in the US and India through certain case laws. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.21">In many countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, United Kingdom etc gays and lesbians have been given the right to form civil unions and domestic partnerships with all the rights and privileges which are allowed to married couples including the right to inheritance, pension benefits etc. while only Belgium, Netherlands and Canada have legalised same-sex marriage in recent years after long struggles. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p2.21">From the late nineteenth century to the mid-20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, homosexuality was considered a 'pathological illness' to be cured by psychiatry and counselling and an abnormality rooted in bad childhood experiences and abused relationships. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.21">Hence the Stonewall riots marked a watershed in the history of gay rights movement since it was the first time gays and lesbians came out openly in public to express their sexualities and to fight against discriminatory legal and social practises. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.21">According to Jeffrey Weeks<ref target="BAWE_0404a-ftnote.001"/>, "the emergence of radical gay movements in the late 1960s and 1970s emphasised on reasserting the values of a lost experience, stressing the positive value of homosexuality and locating the sources of its social oppression. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.21">Since the attitudes toward homosexual behaviour are culturally specific, the concept of homosexuality should be historicized". </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.21">Similarly, Jonathan Katz<ref target="BAWE_0404a-ftnote.002"/> argues that "the existence of a heterosexual history needs to be recognised and explored rather than taken for granted. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.21">The term 'homosexual' was invented only in 1869 while 'heterosexual' can be traced back to 1892" since in England, till 1885 the only law dealing directly with homosexuality was buggery i.e. sodomy which failed to distinguish between man and man, man and animal, man and woman etc<ref target="BAWE_0404a-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

<s n="s5.5;p14.21">In Tom Warner's opinion, "the belief that we need to be legally married to be equal to heterosexuals is simply another insidious form of internalised homophobia".<ref target="BAWE_0404a-ftnote.022"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p15.21">Further, feminist critiques of the institution of marriage as an oppressive patriarchal order designed to suppress women and to keep them secluded in the four walls of the house are put forward by the queer activists who believe that marriage law is another way of domesticating and disciplining queer behaviour into the 'acceptable' norms of the society. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.21">Radical feminists have long opposed marriage on the ground that it is a significant means of controlling women's sexuality, reproductive choices and the construction of the 'womanhood as Ideal Mothers and Ideal Wives' thereby completely excluding them from the economic resources of the State and making them invisible from the public sphere in order to perpetuate the stereotype of them as complete dependents on men. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.21">Hence, marriage has been described by radical feminists as 'sexual slavery' and 'legalization of prostitution'. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p16.21">Also, queer activists have problamatized the notion of same-sex marriage on the basis that it appeals to the State on behalf of a minority group thereby reifying and essentialising gay identity while at the same time, in demanding equal marriage rights, gays and lesbians are forced to assert their similarities with the heterosexuals creating a myth that the only distinction between homosexuals and heterosexuals is the sex of their chosen partner.<ref target="BAWE_0404a-ftnote.024"/> This assumption runs through the assimilationist campaigns of many gay rights group in their demand for marriage and other family rights without subjecting them to a critical analysis of the heteronormative values. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p18.21">So legalizing gay marriage does undermine the traditional patriarchal hegemony". </s>
<s n="s5.5;p18.21">However, this notion of a gay relationship as an equal one is not always true since the influence of the dominant patriarchy and its concomitant values of 'masculinity or feminity' is so entrenched that even within same-sex couples, one partner becomes dominant while the other becomes dependent either emotionally or financially thereby falling into the same trap of a heterosexual relation, for e.g. 'butch-femme' among lesbians where one woman behaves like the man/husband while the other pretends to be the wife. </s>

<p n="p19.21">
<s n="s1.6;p19.21">In the end, I would like to say that the demand for the right to same-sex marriage should be subject to intense scrutiny and critical thinking. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.21">It is imperative to broaden our notion of 'family' in order to be open to all other kinds of families, e.g. same-sex couple adopting a baby without being married etc thereby creating a different definition of family apart from the heterosexual nuclear one. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.21">Also, it needs to be noted that unless an egalitarian and gender sensitive marriage is developed wherein the relationship is based on equal trust and respect, there is no purpose of claiming the right to same-sex marriage except to have access to the state sponsored marital benefits and privilege which are, not of course, unimportant. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.21">Still, the idea of gay marriage is rooted in an assumption of an equal relation which if legalized might even transform the heterosexist bias of the institution of marriage. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.21">However, there is a real danger of pronouncing a moral judgement on those who choose not to be married and also of regulating the sexual fluidity currently existing in homosexual discourse which permits gays and lesbians to experiment with their sexualities by having relationships with men, women, transsexual etc so as not to define their sexual orientation as purely heterosexual/homosexual. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p19.21">Thus, in effect, marriage law could be an instrument to domesticate and tame the so-called 'sexual promiscuity' of gays and lesbians by forcing them to look for monogamous relationships in order to be 'respected' by the society. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.21">
<s n="s1.5;p20.21">But there also exists a constant demand among some gay couples to be legally married and to create an egalitarian relationship distinct from the patriarchal one. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.21">Hence, same-sex marriage should be legalized for those who choose to get married without creating a hierarchy of married and non-married couples. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.21">It might be a good strategy to organise political support and mobilisation to go beyond the categories of heterosexuality/homosexuality, and create a society where being a homosexual or a heterosexual makes no difference to one's rights and dignity. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.21">The gay and lesbian rights movement apart from fighting against heterosexism should also strive for the broader goal of establishing a just social order free from racism, economic deprivation and patriarchy. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p20.21">Thus, efforts should be made to create a world where marital status is no more important than one's driving license and the distinction between homosexuality and heterosexuality is no more than the colour of one's eyes and the former need then not to resort to 'pride marches' to proclaim its identity. </s>
