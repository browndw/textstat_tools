<s n="s1.4;p3.80">The annual report is a good indicator of past performance. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.80">The profit margin has increased from 4.86% (1999) to 12.63% (2003) and as a result the basic earnings per share have increased from 4.38p to 17.98p over the same period. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.80">For future performance the annual report is good for long-term indication of growth on any potential investment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.80">The information I found from public sources about plans to close a plant in Wales and the acquisition of a specialist technology company in Canada, are certainly justifiable from information in the annual report. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.80">The acquisition in particular has increased market share price. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p10.80">By using ratios and/or making comparisons across the last five years (using data in the Fame database, which originally will have come from annual reports) it should be possible to put this profit information into context. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.80">That is, to remove the effects of company size and inflation for example. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.80">Specifically the chosen ratios are: Return on shareholders funds, Capital Gearing and Basic earnings per share. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.80">Also, Gross Profit Margin will be used as an indicator of performance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.80">
<s n="s1.3;p11.80">For Assets and Liabilities mostly the balance sheet is used but to find what state the business is in requires also looking at the efficiency of the entity (ability to turn stocks into profit) and movement of cash in the entity, to see what the entity can afford to do and judge the effectiveness of the directors. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.80">Hence the ratios to be used here are Fixed assets turnover, Stock turnover and Current Ratio. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p13.80">However, since 2001 it has only increased a little perhaps indicating that it may not increase further without expansion. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.80">Indeed expansion would mean issuing more shares to raise the funds, which is only possible when this ratio is high, but the act of which may reduce the ratio anyway assuming the profit initially stays the same. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p15.80">The Capital Gearing shows what proportion of capital comes from long term loans. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.80">It is very important for investors since it can show how much of a risk investing in the entity may be. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.80">If there are many long term loans then the interest rate on these loans may affect the entity severely. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.80">Profits need to be sufficiently high to guarantee that the interest rates do not affect it. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.80">Radstone has neither a typically high or low capital gearing but it has been steadily decreasing over the last few years representing an inviting investment. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p15.80">This is due to the steady repayment of long term loans, combined with increasing profit the risk to investors is reduced; if the company went into liquidation at least there would be something left over for the shareholders after loans were paid back. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.80">The basic earnings per share are taken from the annual report. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.80">There has been a significant increase in this over the years which is good news for share holders since it means there is investment growth and stability. </s>

<p n="p17.80">
<s n="s1.8;p17.80">The gross profit margin in Fame is the same as the, "profit margin" or "net profit ratio" calculated in the Radstone-best file. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p17.80">They are the same here though, because the numerator, net profit, has had the interest deducted before tax, which is gross profit (the denominator is turnover). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p17.80">It relates profit to sales irrespective of entity size. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p17.80">It seems that while both the profit and turnover have increased over the last 5 years, the profit has increased more rapidly resulting in an overall increase in this ratio. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p17.80">Typically a high value at 12.63% currently indicates Radstone are in a strong position to choose the pricing of their products. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p17.80">In the annual report on page 7 it talks about the increasing profit margin in its Embedded Computing business due to its "rugged" computer products which may represent a niche market the business is settling in. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p17.80">On pages 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11 of the annual report it is learned that while the Embedded computing business has enjoyed increases in profit margins the other of Radstone groups businesses, EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Service), has suffered profit margin losses. </s>

<head rend="underlined italic">Fixed assets turnover</head>
<p n="p20.80">
<s n="s1.5;p20.80">The fixed assets turnover ratio (Profit from sales (turnover) ÷ Total fixed assets) shows how efficiently the entity produces goods. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.80">It is best used as a comparison between alternative years. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.80">For Radstone there is a considerable reduction (>50%) of this ratio from 1999 to 2000. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.80">This could represent the purchasing of a large piece of machinery or perhaps upgrading, since the profit from sales has remained similar or at least not changed enough to more than half this ratio. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p21.80">This example shows where Radstone have managed to reduce lead times and thereby increase efficiency. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p22.80">Radstone secured a short term contract in 2003 which is no doubt how the stock turnover has increased greatly this year. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.80">Using this indicator it appears that the efficiency of the company is at least stabilizing or indeed increasing which is what the shareholders will be looking for. </s>

<head rend="underlined italic">Current ratio</head>
<p n="p23.80">
<s n="s1.6;p23.80">Current ratio has doubled since 1999 showing Radstone has doubled how quickly they can turn assets into cash. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p23.80">The ratio uses the current liabilities as the denominator and so can also tell how able the company is to meet financial commitments. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p23.80">Hence, it is a liquidity ratio, reflective of the effectiveness of the directors. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p23.80">The financial health of Radstone appears to be good based on this ratio and the large increase from 2002 and 2003 as in the Chairman's statement is likely due to the large one-off contract that was won. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p23.80">Perhaps such an increase could be worrying as it may mean not enough working capital is been used. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p25.80">In 2002 the working capital seemed to jump massively but it was probably actually due to lower sales in 2002 which was known to be a "difficult" year. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.80">The fact that they have reduced this percentage in 2003 is indicative of increased sales but more importantly that the working capital is not too low when compared to sales. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p26.80">Without this would the apparent continuous increase in performance of the company have held? </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.80">This is hard to answer at any rate but they are making the most of the good times by paying off long term debts and producing good earnings on invested money. </s>
