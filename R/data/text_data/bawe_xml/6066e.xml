<s n="s2.4;p1.9">Henceforth it was a topic of considerable interest to the Roman people. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.9">There were a number of different ideas about what the human life cycle consisted of in ancient Rome, for example, the Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy believed that there were seven ages of man which were connected to the planets<ref target="BAWE_6066e-ftnote.002"/>, Aristotle thought the human soul and life-cycle to be tripartite in nature<ref target="BAWE_6066e-ftnote.003"/>, and the Roman poet Horace saw life as a progression between four distinct stages that he called <hi rend="italic">aetates</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_6066e-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.9">These theories have their various differences; however all of them seem to agree on the characteristics that one should associate with the period that comes just before adulthood, namely the period known as either <hi rend="italic">iuventus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">adulescentia</hi> which we would today call youth or puberty. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.9">The beginning of this stage of life was marked by an important ceremony that took place in both the privacy of the family home and in public to signify the start of a young man's journey towards adulthood and responsibility. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.9">A description of the private part of the ceremony can be found in Horace who recalls how he, like every other Roman boy, placed his bulla and <hi rend="italic">toga praetexta</hi> to one side and dedicated them to the household gods since he no longer needed the protection that his locket and the purple stripe of his toga bestowed on him<ref target="BAWE_6066e-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.9">After these dedications the young man would don his new white adult toga known as the <hi rend="italic">toga virilis</hi> and would accompany his father to the forum for the public part of the ceremony. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.9">The public part of the ceremony emphasized the filial duty of son to father and thus in the Augustan Age it took place in the Forum of Augustus in front of the Temple of Mars the Avenger (dedicated by Augustus to Julius Caesar). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.9">The ceremony was seen as a highly important rite of passage for Roman youths since it was in essence the day that their childhood would end and their adulthood would begin. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.9">With the advent of adolescence there was also an added sense of freedom from the control of their parents but more especially from their pedagogue who no longer accompanied them everywhere since they were not thought to need the protection that they had needed in their childhood. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p3.9">Not surprisingly, in complete contrast to the magnitude and grandeur of the celebration of a Roman male's transition from childhood to adulthood and the freedom that came with it was the way in which this transition is celebrated for Roman females. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.9">From the evidence we have available to us (that is mainly literary evidence), it would seem that as soon as a girl reached puberty she was married off if she was from a wealthy family and if this did not happen she spent her time preparing for marriage with the women of the household, away from her male relatives. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.9">The control exercised over her by her parents would also increase since her father's reputation would be at stake when she would eventually marry and if she was found for example, to not be a virgin, her father could be ruined. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.9">In essence it would seem that the adult life of a female began on her wedding night and she did not have a stage of <hi rend="italic">iuventus</hi> so to speak. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.9">She more or less changed from someone's daughter to a wife and mother in an entirely different household. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.9">I feel that it should be noted here that the evidence we have of youth in ancient Rome consists of mainly literary sources written by the male elite, we have no female opinions on this matter and therefore we have little to no information concerning the youth of females and also how the youth of males differed between the rich and the poor. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_6066e-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s2.5;p4.9">Youth was seen as a disease of sorts that had to be battled with until one reached the mid-twenties and were miraculously cured and thus the immoral behaviour commonly associated with youth was to some extent tolerated by the majority of Romans because they believed that it needed to be worked out of the system and would in the end result in the creation of better citizens. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.9">The male body was seen as containing an innate heat by Roman medicine and it was at its hottest in youth cooling gradually as they aged.<ref target="BAWE_6066e-ftnote.008"/> Thus it was simply part of life that they were literally seen as hot-headed and impetuous. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.9">Youth was seen as very much a temporary stage of life in which everything bad and un-Roman was let loose in a semi-controlled environment before these youths became married men and were expected to serve the state either in the military or in politics. </s>
