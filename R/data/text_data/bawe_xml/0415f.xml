<s n="s1.2;p1.20">My work involves the synthesis of sugar functionalised polymers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.20">These are made from aldose monomers such as 5-benzyl-5-β-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3-dimethylbarbiturate <hi rend="bold">1</hi> which are formed from alkylation of the sugar-barbiturate sodium salt <hi rend="bold">2</hi>. </s>

<p n="p2.20">
<s n="s1.4;p2.20">Reaction monitoring and indeed the first stage in product characterisation is done by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.20">Any new material formed in a reaction will have a specific R <hi rend="sub">f</hi> value with a given solvent system. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.20">TLC will show any major by-products of the reaction and their relative polarity, in essence, how 'pure' the intended reaction product is. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.20">The method is inexpensive and provides results quickly. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.3;p3.20">Many of the reactions conducted require extractions with several solvents to isolate the product. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.20">When the reaction is novel, TLC and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are used to determine which components of the reaction mixture have partitioned into which solvents. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.20">If TLC shows a clear partition, and the simple proton spectra allow us to identify the species expected in each solvent, whether it be starting material, product, or by-product, this is normally sufficient and efforts are concentrated on purification of the product. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.3;p4.20">The desired product is usually purified by column chromatography. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.20">TLC is used initially to determine the species' progress through the column, and then <hi rend="sup">1</hi>H NMR and Correlated Spectroscopy (COSY) of the collected fractions allow us to identify the species present. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.20">Proton spectra with automatic moisture suppressant treatment are useful at this stage as removal of solvent from these monomers is difficult due to their amphiphilic nature [1]. </s>

<head rend="bold">3</head>

<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.3;p5.20">Exact assignment of spectral peaks in the <hi rend="sup">1</hi>H spectra of species such as <hi rend="bold">1</hi> is difficult as the proton signals for the sugar and the benzylic CH <hi rend="sub">2</hi> overlap. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.20">In order to characterise species such as these, the tetra-acetate derivative <hi rend="bold">3</hi> is formed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.20">This spreads the pyranoid ring proton resonances over a greater range (3.0 - 5.8 ppm). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.4;p6.20">The <hi rend="sup">1</hi>H spectrum is studied in detail to determine the size of <hi rend="sup italic">3J</hi> coupling constants in the sugar, which are indicative of the relative configurations of the stereogenic centres present. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.20">Their size provides evidence for the trans-diaxial conformation of protons found only in the pyranose ring form. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.20">The <hi rend="sup italic">3J</hi>
<hi rend="sub">H1-2</hi> coupling constant size of ca. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.20">10 Hz is indicative of the β configuration of the alkyl barbiturate at the anomeric centre. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.20">
<s n="s1.4;p7.20">
<hi rend="sup">13</hi>C NMR spectra also aid characterisation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.20">For example, C-5 of the barbiturate holds no protons but it resonates at ca. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.20">58 ppm, characteristic of the 5,5-disubstituted barbiturate [2]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.20">
<hi rend="sup">1</hi>H - <hi rend="sup">13</hi>C COSY (HMQC) and the longer range HMBC spectra are used also at this stage to assign with confidence all signals in the proton and carbon spectra. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.1;p8.20">A great amount of previous work has established NMR spectroscopy as the primary tool for product characterisation in this field [1-5]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.20">
<s n="s1.2;p9.20">The lactosyl derivative of <hi rend="bold">1</hi> is water soluble and was extracted from its reaction mixture along with the reaction by-product NaCl. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.20">The apparently high yielding reaction showed only the intended product by NMR. This example highlights the inability of NMR to detect non-protic impurities and the care that must be taken when interpreting spectra. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.20">
<s n="s1.6;p10.20">Next, low resolution EI Mass Spectra (MS) are taken of the products. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.20">After confirming the mass of the molecular ion, we can assess if the fragmentation pattern is as predicted. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.20">For example, <hi rend="bold">1</hi> fragments as expected to give a peak at <hi rend="italic">m/z</hi> = 117 for benzyl ethene. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.20">Mass spectroscopy as a standalone method has limitations too: a mixture of unreacted barbituric acid <hi rend="italic">and</hi> <hi rend="bold">1</hi> may produce a spectrum similar to that from purely <hi rend="bold">1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.20">NMR would however be able to differentiate between the samples as the two methyl groups in the unreacted acid are equivalent whereas in <hi rend="bold">1</hi> they are magnetically inequivalent. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.20">So only in conjunction with NMR data can this technique be used to elucidate structure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.20">
<s n="s1.2;p11.20">Elemental analysis (EA), in this work specifically CHN analysis, is a good indicator of purity of a sample with a known structure. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.20">Unfortunately, compounds such as <hi rend="bold">1</hi> have an unusually high affinity for solvents such as DMSO we use in their synthesis and removal of the last traces of these is problematic, complicating the results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.20">
<s n="s1.3;p12.20">Measurement of melting point can be another measure of purity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.20">Melting points for species similar to <hi rend="bold">1</hi> and <hi rend="bold">2</hi> have been reported as ranges over 6-9°C, owing to the problems of removing solvent. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.20">The additional problem of the ability of <hi rend="bold">1</hi> to auto polymerisation at temperatures above 70°C also makes this problematic. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.20">
<s n="s1.3;p13.20">For publication in the leading journals in this field, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>H and <hi rend="sup">13</hi>C NMR along with MS data for the molecular ion, and CHN analysis are all required. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.20">In the near future, and after thorough drying, CHN analysis will be carried out on <hi rend="bold">1</hi> and <hi rend="bold">2</hi> as will melting point determination to complete this data set. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.20">Also, given that the tetra-acetate derivative <hi rend="bold"> 2</hi> is crystalline, it would be informative to determine the crystal structure to have some idea of the relative orientation of the barbiturate and alkyl moieties. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.20">
<s n="s1.2;p14.20">In summary, NMR is the primary tool used for product characterisation, with MS and EA providing supplementary information. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.20">Infra-red Spectroscopy is not used due to the complexity of the spectra obtained. </s>
