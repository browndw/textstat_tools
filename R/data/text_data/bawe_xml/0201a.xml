<s n="s2.2;p144.159">This poor agreement suggests that there has been an overoptimistic evaluation of one or more of the random errors acting on the system. </s>
</p>
<p n="p145.159">
<s n="s1.3;p145.159">The error in E depends on the errors in the gradient, and hence in f <hi rend="sub">n</hi>, and the errors in r, L, and T. the error in r has already been discussed in previous sections, as have the errors in L and T. The errors in T and r were judged to have been evaluated correctly, and the error in L was re-evaluated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p145.159">This re-evaluation has been taken into account when calculating the error in the value of E quoted above. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p145.159">Therefore it seems as though the error in f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> must have been misevaluated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p146.159">
<s n="s1.3;p146.159">During this investigation, the values of f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> were much more difficult to find than in previous investigations as noted in section <hi rend="italic">2.5</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p146.159">The frequency meter readings were also observed to fluctuate over a wider range than in previous investigations, again as noted in section <hi rend="italic">2.5</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p146.159">These two factors led to a re-evaluation of the error in f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> from previous investigations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p147.159">
<s n="s1.4;p147.159">It was felt that the combination of the two factors outlined in the previous paragraph led to a range of frequencies in which each harmonic could lie of approximately 8Hz. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p147.159">It was therefore decided that the error in the values of f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> obtained should be ±4.0Hz, or half of the possible range of frequencies within which f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> could lie. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p147.159">Figure 10 was plotted using this initial re-evaluation of the error in f <hi rend="sub">n.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.4;p147.159">However the discrepancy between the accepted value of E and the value obtained suggests that the error in f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> must be re-evaluated once more. </s>
</p>
<p n="p148.159">
<s n="s1.4;p148.159">The error in the value of E obtained through experimentation must be larger if the two values are to agree, suggesting that the re-evaluation of the error in f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> was still too low. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p148.159">However if the size of the y-error bars on figure 10 is considered, it appears that the error in f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> has been overestimated as the error bars appear too large for the standard deviation of the graph. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p148.159">Since these two factors directly contradict one another, it must be concluded that the evaluation of the error in the values of f <hi rend="sub">n</hi> was in fact reasonable. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p148.159">Therefore the discrepancy between the calculated and accepted values of E is likely to be due to a systematic error. </s>
</p>
<p n="p149.159">
<s n="s1.3;p149.159">A possible source of this systematic error is the way in which the harmonic frequencies were found. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p149.159">It is stated in section <hi rend="italic">2.5</hi> that the values of the harmonic frequencies appeared to be different depending on whether the frequency was being increased or decreased in the vicinity of the resonance, and that it was decided to obtain all of the results by decreasing the local frequency. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p149.159">It is possible that this was the wrong decision, and that the values obtained through the increase of the frequency in the vicinity of the harmonic frequency would have yielded a more accurate value of E. Why this might be the case is not certain, but it is a possibility that must be considered. </s>
</p>
<p n="p150.159">
<s n="s1.4;p150.159">Another factor that might have produced a systematic error was the interference caused by background noise. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p150.159">This was a particular problem during this experiment as the amplitude peaks in the oscilloscope trace were often very small, and would therefore have been swamped by background noise. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p150.159">Listening to the wire would have helped in this situation, but would not have completely compensated for this effect. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p150.159">Although plausible, it is unlikely that this possibility is the source of the systematic error, as particular care was taken to minimise the amount of background noise, and to try and take results during quiet moments, in this investigation, as it was recognised that it would be a particular problem once the small magnitude of the amplitude peaks was realised. </s>
</p>
<p n="p151.159">
<s n="s1.4;p151.159">A third possibility is that the driver and detector were not in the optimal positions along the length of wire under consideration in order to cause and detect forced oscillations in the wire. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p151.159">The driver and detector were not moved from their starting positions during the course of this experiment, and it was only once the investigation was concluded that this was realised. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p151.159">In order to produce a pure standing wave pattern, the driver must be positioned in an antinodal position, and the detector must be in a similar position in order to pick up any changes in the forced oscillations. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p151.159">The wire length used, 0.25m, would have resulted in movements of the driver and detector of only a few centimetres each time, but it might have been an important factor in the quality of results obtained. </s>
</p>
<p n="p152.159">
<s n="s1.1;p152.159">This might also explain the shallow curve to the data plotted on figure 10, as the antinodal positions would have moved away from the driver and detector before moving towards them again as the value of n increased and the number of half-wavelengths within the length of wire under investigation increased. </s>
</p>
<p n="p153.159">
<s n="s1.3;p153.159">Once the difficulties involved in the location of the harmonic frequencies using the first method outlined in section <hi rend="italic">2.1</hi> had become apparent, or once the full set of data had been taken, it might have been prudent to attempt to find the harmonic frequencies again using the second method involving Lissajous figures outlined in section <hi rend="italic">2.1</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p153.159">Although the Lissajous figures would have been very unstable due to the highly sensitive nature of the equipment during this investigation, and hence the frequencies would still have been hard to find, this would have provided a second set of data and allowed any possible anomalous results to be identified. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p153.159">It might also have proved to be slightly easier to find frequencies at which the Lissajous figures became stationary than to find the frequencies at which the oscilloscope trace underwent a very small amplitude increase. </s>

<p n="p154.159">
<s n="s1.3;p154.159">The experimental setup was generally sufficient for the investigations being undertaken, but the sensitivity of the frequency meter and oscilloscope sometimes became very problematic. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p154.159">In order to try and compensate for this sensitivity, the experiment could be carried out in isolation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p154.159">Performing the experiment in a separate room would help to minimise the effects of background noise on the frequency meter reading and oscilloscope trace. </s>
</p>
<p n="p155.159">
<s n="s1.4;p155.159">The other problem encountered whilst carrying out these investigations was the small magnitude of the amplitude peaks in the oscilloscope traces observed at the harmonic frequencies, which often made the harmonic frequencies quite difficult to pinpoint. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p155.159">As mentioned in section <hi rend="italic">4.4</hi> this might have been offset by utilising the Lissajous figures for the final investigation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p155.159">However in general it is difficult to see how this problem could be addressed without substantial changes to the experimental method, although the use of a more precise audio oscillator might help. </s>
