</p>
<p n="p3.53">
<s n="s1.3;p3.53">This paper will firstly evaluate different financial ratios of this company which are based on Clayton Ltd's historical financial statements for the latest two years and deduce several factors that this company need to consider before expansion. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.53">Secondly, the two funding options will be examined both from the positive side and negative side and relative assumptions will be stated according to the ratio evaluation. </s>

<p n="p4.53">
<s n="s1.6;p4.53">Financial ratio analysis mainly aims at determining the overall financial condition of a business (Dennis, 2006). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.53">Before any business expansion, it is crucial to analyze the current financial situation of the company and opt for the appropriate funding resources. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.53">As Gordon (2006) pointed out, ratio analysis can indicate how far a market might retreat and advance. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.53">Ratios for the financial status are to be calculated and referred as the foundation of the analysis. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.53">Ratio analysis is also an aid to decision making in the future, particularly in helping companies to decide what kind of funding sources they cold make use of in the future for either development, expansion or maintenance. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.53">The following part of the report analyses various financial ratios to help the company decide which source of funding would be ideal for the company. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p6.53">It reflects a company's ability to generate revenue. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.53">According to Dunn (2006), ROCE is the main evaluation method of business profitability. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.53">It represents how well the shareholder's funds are employed in making profit. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.53">From table1, it suggests that the Clayton's capital has been utilized efficiently to generate return over the past two years. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.53">In another way, the ROCE is adequate to provide return to the shareholders. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p7.53">Net profit ratio is net profit (net income after tax) divided by sales. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.53">Both of these two ratios indicate how efficiently a company is during its trading process (Dennis, 2006). </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.53">
<s n="s1.3;p8.53">The return may also be analyzed in more detail by using GPR and NPR. Apparently, as the Gross profit ratio results show that, Clayton has been trading fairly well in the latest two years. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.53">However, the NPR is much lower than the GPR, which indicates that the company might have a huge loss on other expenses or overheads, office expenses and salaries for instance. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.53">The company needs to see if they could reduce their other expenditures including yearly interests on their loans. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.53">
<s n="s1.3;p9.53">By comparing these two years' gross profit ratios, a slight decline can be seen, which is from 66.14% to 64.63%. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.53">It can be concluded that although the Clayton has an increase both in gross profit and sales, they may experience a fall in selling price or a rise in cost per unit. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.53">If this trend continues in the future expanding, they might face a huge loss in trading. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.53">
<s n="s1.2;p10.53">In addition, as Clayton decided to spend 250,000 ponds on working capital (one fifth of total amount of raising funds), which is only half of the investment on web sites. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.53">They may be unable to generate enough sales and income to support their heavier debts in the future (Deakin, 1972). </s>

<s n="s2.6;p11.53">From the table1, figures show that Clayton has achieved good selling price in the past two years. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.53">However, a slight decline of this ratio can be seen from year1 to year2. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.53">This trend may result from promotion activities, which aims at stimulating extra sales by reducing the gross profit. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.53">To make more profit from financial expansion in the future, this company may fall into overtrading. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.53">This will increase the risk of business failure, as they may not have adequate capital to support the higher level of sales. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p13.53">The ratio formula is cost of goods sold divided by average inventory. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.53">In general, the higher the ratio the better the business is performing (Dennis, 2006). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.53">The figures from table 2 clearly indicates that Clayton have not been selling their finished products quickly onto the market. </s>

<head rend="underlined">2.2.3 Receivables Collection Period</head>
<p n="p15.53">
<s n="s1.3;p15.53">Receivable collection period is often determined by dividing the receivables by (sales/365) (Parker, 2006). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.53">This ratio is expressed as the number of days that a business uses to collect its receivables from customers. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p16.53">The formula is net sales divided by capital employed. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p18.53">In normal circumstances, current ratio around two is acceptable. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.53">In this case, figures show that Clayton appears to be temporarily insolvent as it has far more current liabilities than current asset. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.53">Whereas, since Clayton has been successful for five years, they may have used others' money to fund its own activities. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.53">If this company has large sum of borrowings they do need to resolve its cash flow problems. </s>

<p n="p19.53">
<s n="s1.9;p19.53">Acid test ratio formula is current assets (excludes inventories) divided by current liabilities. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p19.53">The ratio shows the degree to which a company's current liabilities can be covered by its liquid assets (Parker, 2006). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p19.53">It is a more conservative measure than current ratio. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p19.53">As the inventory is not always easy to be exchanged into cash immediately, and for Clayton, its stock turnover period is too long, it is reasonable to ignore the stock when calculating liquidity ratio. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p19.53">The ratio is very low, which means Clayton may not be able to insure the payment of its current liabilities. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p19.53">Moreover, comparing the current ratio with acid ratio for each year, a large gap can be seen. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p19.53">This indicates that Clayton had a high inventory which may not be converted into cash quickly. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p19.53">Under the condition that a large sum of cash is needed on the next financial year to expanding their business, if the company cannot receive big profits or adjust its financial structure, the risk of disability to pay liabilities will be enhanced. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p20.53">As Clayton considers expanding its trading into internet, the amount of working capital on year2 balance sheet should be greater than that of previous year. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.53">However, the figures show that the company may be wasting current assets which could be more efficiently deployed in increasing sales and profits, or that the company may be undercapitalized, and thus the Clayton may fall into a period of weak business conditions (Parker, 2006). </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">3.1 Comparison between debt finance and equity finance</head>
<p n="p23.53">
<s n="s1.2;p23.53">Commonly, debt finance (loan capital) and equity finance (share capital) are the main funding resources for a business. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p23.53">As the Clayton has made its decision of business expansion, it is crucial to compare and contrast these two financing sources in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">3.1.1 Advantages of Debt finance:</head>
<p n="p24.53">
<s n="s1.4;p24.53">Debt finance is a kind of finance which involves a principal amount being lent by an institute for a fixed (or Variable) interest rate paid annually. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.53">This type of funding source is usually repaid over a longer period of time, usually within 5 to 30 years. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.53">This type of finance is quite quick for the company to gather and also it is quite stable regardless of the company's profits. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.53">Such a mode of finance creates a lower pressure on the cash flow of the company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.53">
<s n="s1.3;p25.53">Debt finance is considerably simpler to initiate at the start. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.53">One of the main advantages over equity finance would be that the borrowing company would not have to loose out on their control over the company to its investors. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.53">The company would not have to include its banking institute in the company's decision meeting policies. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">3.1.2 Disadvantages of debt finance:</head>
<p n="p26.53">
<s n="s1.2;p26.53">Since the interest amount would have to be paid annually the company would have to have a steady cash flow the entire year. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.53">Higher the rates higher would be the interest amount to be paid annually. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.53">
<s n="s1.4;p27.53">The result of higher interest would be directly in terms of affecting the profit of the company. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.53">This would affect the balance and income statements' of the company in case of future source of funding. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.53">Most of the loans usually come as a secured loan - Debentures. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.53">This would mean that in case due to faulty interest payment annually, the company may risk loosing some of its property or any other thing which has been secured against the loan. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">3.1.3 Advantages of equity finance:</head>
<p n="p28.53">
<s n="s1.2;p28.53">Equity finance is another term for raising funds by issuing shares. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.53">In such type of finance there is no form of interest to be paid annually but the company needs to pay some form of dividends to its shareholders to create an interest in investing with the company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.53">
<s n="s1.2;p29.53">Another huge advantage over debt finance is that the principle amount never needs to be paid and the shareholders make or loose money according to the market demand of the company shares. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.53">In the case of liquidation also, the shareholders are the last in line to receive the funds and the company is not forced to pay its shareholders. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">3.1.4 Disadvantages of equity finance:</head>
<p n="p30.53">
<s n="s1.3;p30.53">As mentioned before, the company looses a bit of control over the company's decision making policy of the company to its shareholders. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.53">This is bad in case the company is willing to make change and its shareholders do not agree. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.53">The initial cost of issuing shares is also high. </s>

<head rend="bold">3.2 Analysis of two given financing offers</head>
<p n="p31.53">
<s n="s1.3;p31.53">To maximise the return for the business expansion, any form of raising funds should be as much effective as possible. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p31.53">Otherwise, in the longer term, the returns may fall. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p31.53">Thus, to examine and analyze different funding options is important for financial decision making. </s>
</p>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined">3.2.1 Analysis of option 1 - loan from banking institute:</head>
<p n="p32.53">
<s n="s1.2;p32.53">If the option 1 is accepted, Clayton will be given total expansion funds they need all at once, which is 2 million ponds per year with secured loan at a fixed rate of 14.5% from an insurance company. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p32.53">As part of the agreement, the insurance company requires the option to buy 500,000 new ordinary shares from Clayton at 10 pence rate. </s>
</p>
<div4>
<head rend="underlined">Strengths: </head>
<p n="p33.53">
<s n="s1.3;p33.53">Assuming that the insurance company is not going to buy shares from Clayton, the cost of sourcing finance will be largely reduced as there is no expense on issuing a prospectus. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.53">Moreover, the Clayton will remain its ownership. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.53">They are only required to pay fixed interests annually and repay the principal at some time in the future. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<head rend="underlined">Weaknesses: </head>
<p n="p34.53">
<s n="s1.4;p34.53">Raising the whole expansion funds by means of loan capital may lead to a huge loss of profit and impose an internal stress to the business, as Clayton has to pay considerable amount of interest to service its debts every year. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.53">As the insurance company has the option to buy new ordinary shares from Clayton at a very low price as part of the agreement, the Clayton might loose part of its owner rights. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.53">Additionally, if the banking institute decides to force the option of buying shares from the company, at the rate of 10 pence per share for 500,000 shares, the then market price of the share would drop drastically due to this. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.53">This would not satisfy the shareholders as their market value of the share has depreciated, and may distort the share market to some extend. </s>
