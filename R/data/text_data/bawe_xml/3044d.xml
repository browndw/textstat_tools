<s n="s2.6;p1.53">New species are appearing at such a rapid rate that the important process of scientifically identifying and naming species has been put on the backburner. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.53">Effective conservation work is dependent on an updated taxonomy in order to acknowledge the width of the biodiversity one is trying to save (Groves, 2001; Grubb <hi rend="italic">et al.,</hi> 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.53">The proposed investigation concerns a taxonomic study of one up to four as yet scientifically unnamed primates of the genus <hi rend="italic">Galagoides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sciurocheirus</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.53">The study's main objective will be to compile sufficient amounts of character data, i.e. behavioral, biogeographical, morphological and genetic data, to enable the endorsement of species status independent of species concept applied (see Groves, 2001 for overview) with the specific aim as to publicly name these species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (IUZN, 1999) regulations. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.53">The data collected will create the body of a comprehensive database over the known information of the family Galagidae. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p2.53">The subheadings are arbitrarily set and do not set an absolute topic content to the source information. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.53">Many sources could, for example, fit under Material and Methods but has ended up under some section in Behavioural Ecology. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p3.53">PSC has been described as a pattern-based concept (in contrast to the Biological Species Concept and its alike in being process-based) and has been described by Groves (2004) "as nearly objective as we are likely to get" when it comes to describing taxonomy of extant species. </s>
