<s n="s4.4;p3.39">And the latter school (such as Cameron, Garret, Swank, Rodrik &amp; Weiss) argues that the state increases its intervention (such as social insurance) to offset the increase of the risk in the globalizing world. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p4.39">But the former and latter overemphasizes the international force and domestic force respectively. </s>

<p n="p5.39">
<s n="s1.4;p5.39">This paper uses the transformationalist school of thought (concept of competition state invented by Cerny) to find the way of state transformation and prevent the prejudice on either decrease or increase of state intervention. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p5.39">Then it shows the way and reason of the transformation of role of state by using IPE and CPE framework and applies into three countries (Singapore, Korea and Japan). </s>

<s n="s1.12;p32.39">The reduction of state intervention, in fact, has still been progressing since 1996. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p32.39">For example, the change in employment laws in 2003 led to the end of 'lifetime employment system'. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p32.39">The previous employment laws restricted the temporary employment. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p32.39">But after facing the problem of the cheap labor cost in the other East Asian States, the Japanese realized that the employment should be flexible enough to compete with them. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p32.39">This new labor flexibility has contributed to boom in company profits and ease the debt problem in business sector. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p32.39">Recently, the neo-liberal reform is more rapid. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p32.39">After winning election in 2001, Prime Minister Koizumi drafted a privatization of postal saving plan which has gained the popular support. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p32.39">In 2005, both houses of diet passed his plan which further implements this privatization of this world's largest bank. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p32.39">And the bank could use its saving more efficiently after this reform. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p32.39">At this moment, it is doubtful that the Koizumi's plan is successful. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p32.39">Because his leadership term will end very soon and his rival is conservative, we do not ensure that another failure of Hashimoto's structural reform will happen again. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p32.39">But we can be sure that the neo-liberal project is still the main trend of reform in Japan, and the speed of implementation depends on the support from the domestic politics. </s>

<p n="p33.39">
<s n="s1.6;p33.39">Schotle said, 'We live in globalizing rather than completely globalized condition'.<ref target="BAWE_0257d-ftnote.038"/> Under the trend of globalization, the concept of developmental state which focuses on state-led development is necessary to transform to the competition state in order to maintain the national interest, but it cannot be completely transformed. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p33.39">After the fast economic development, the three above countries found that the heavy state intervention is needed to decrease: Singapore found the problem of state-owned enterprise after the economic recession in 1980s; Korea and Japan leaders used the way of de-regulation to solve its problematic economic structure after the Asian Financial crisis and Bubble Economy respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p33.39">But the neo-liberal reform has not completed yet in these states. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p33.39">As shown in Japan, the MOF still do not give the regulatory power to the independent organization FSA, but the other neo-liberal project such as privatization is necessarily progressing because of the outdated state intervention. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p33.39">In Singapore, the flexible wage system keep improving, the state gave more flexible to the private sector to decide the wage from 1986 to 1999, although state still controlled 70% of wage. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p33.39">But the concept of competition state can be seen as a destination of the East Asian State. </s>

<p n="p34.39">
<s n="s1.7;p34.39">From the three cases, we can find that the speeds of the neo-liberal reform are different in every state. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p34.39">The privatization and flexible wage system in Singapore and deregulation in Korea went smoother than the deregulation in Japan. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p34.39">As explained by Cerny, because of the different economic structure, the three countries carried out the convergent political globalization in the path-dependent way. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p34.39">Due to the great influence of foreign investor in Singapore and International Organization (IMF) in Korea, the reform carried out more quickly in order to make the market friendly environment. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p34.39">On the other hand, because of long history of protectionist, the conservative domestic politics, and the incident such as Asian financial crisis, the reform in Japan was carried out more carefully to prevent hurting the domestic's interest. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p34.39">From this, we can see that the merit of combining the IPE (international factor) and CPE (state and society relation). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p34.39">This gives us a full picture of political globalization of different states in the world and shows the divergent and convergent of the process. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.39">
<s n="s1.2;p35.39">In addition, the privatization in Singapore and the deregulation in Korea and Japan can show Cerny's transformation approach: shift from the macro-interventionism to micro-interventionism. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.39">In the case of Korea, the financial institution gave the subsidies based on the performance rather than protection (adopted in the past) which can show shift from intervention based on comparative advantage to intervention based on competitive advantage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.39">
<s n="s1.7;p36.39">But the East Asian state can not show the shift from welfare state to competition state, since there is no any significant change in social expenditure in these states. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p36.39">In fact, the developmental state was not a welfare state. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p36.39">Since the states including three above cases feared the spread of communism after providing the egalitarian environment during the cold period, they tried to reduce the welfare burden in the early development. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p36.39">For example, Japan is described as 'Liberal Welfare states' which relied more on the family and the community on the welfare starting from early 1970s.<ref target="BAWE_0257d-ftnote.039"/> At the same time, Singapore introduced the Central Provident Fund which shifted the welfare burden to the community. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p36.39">So the shift claimed by Cerny is not applicable in East Asia. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p36.39">He invoked the competition state concept, because he wanted to demonstrate the decrease of welfare in Nordic countries. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p36.39">He did not expect that the Nordic countries are different from developmental states in the provision of welfare. </s>

<p n="p37.39">
<s n="s1.8;p37.39">The concept has some limitations too. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p37.39">As discussed before, Cerny admitted that there are some paradox of competition state which means that the political globalization 'does not lead to a simple decline of the state but may be seen to have some expansion of state intervention and regulation in the name of competitiveness and marketization." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0257d-ftnote.040"/>
<s n="s3.8;p37.39">He thinks that state would use its visible hand (such as social welfare) occasionally to offset the increase of social risk caused by the globalization.<ref target="BAWE_0257d-ftnote.041"/> But the state policy would not be like the Polyani Double movement which substantially increases or decreases the state intervention. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p37.39">In the case of Korea, the state gave financial support to the high technology industry in short term to recover the economy after the crisis. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p37.39">But Cerny is optimistic for the maintenance of competition state, because his main assumption is the dominance of Neo-liberal idea in the world. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p37.39">In fact, not every part of the world is dominated by Neo-liberal idea. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p37.39">For example, the Islamic World has strong economic nationalism ideology which opposed this idea. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p37.39">But most of the East Asian States do not have strong reason to completely deny neo-liberal idea now, because their economies still perform well under this ideology. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p38.39">The concept of competition state is applicable to the East Asian State generally. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p38.39">They are also being transformed to competition state from developmental state. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p38.39">Similarly with Korea, several Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand were demanded to move away from 'Crony capitalism' by IMF. Taiwan decreased the subsidies to strategic industry because of preparation of joining WTO. China's state-own enterprises were closed down after the open policy. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p38.39">Non-developmental state, Hong Kong, also carried out the privatization to solve the problem of budget deficit. </s>

<p n="p39.39">
<s n="s1.3;p39.39">From this paper, we can see that the globalization is not simply about the retreat or enhancement of state. </s>
