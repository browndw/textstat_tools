<s n="s1.3;p1.29">Establishment of asymmetry and specification of cell fate in the C. elegans embryo are processes occurring at a very early stage of embryogenesis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.29">Maternal effect genes play a predominant role in initiating asymmetrical divisions and certain cell-cell interactions that influence cell fate, and mutations in these genes often have detrimental results concerning the embryonic phenotype. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.29">The functions and mechanisms of regulation of maternal effect genes have been extensively studied in the last two decades, mainly by investigating the effects of genetic modifications on young <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> embryos. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Introduction</head>
<p n="p2.29">
<s n="s1.8;p2.29">The invertebrate <hi rend="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</hi> is a small nematode worm, which normally lives in soil, feeds on micro-organisms and measures only 1 mm in length. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p2.29">It has several properties that made it very popular among developmental biologists as a model organism after being discovered as such by Sydney Brenner in the 1960s. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p2.29">Embryogenesis only takes 16 hours and can be accomplished in vitro. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p2.29">Furthermore the embryos are transparent, thus development can be monitored easily. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p2.29">Adults can be stored as frozen stocks and recover upon thawing. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p2.29">And because the species consists of few males and mostly hermaphrodites, one hermaphrodite individual can seed a whole population by self-fertilisation since it produces both sperm and eggs. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p2.29">Also, <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> has a small genome with less than 20000 genes, which has been entirely sequenced. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p2.29">It can be easily genetically manipulated with techniques common in developmental biology to identify important genes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.29">
<s n="s1.3;p3.29">Because <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> is remarkably simple, with an invariant somatic cell lineage, all cell divisions and any inductive interactions between cells are programmed and predictable. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.29">Thus the origin of the 959 somatic cells within each adult organism is exactly known. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.29">Therefore, <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> serves as an excellent example for the determinate mode of development exhibited by various, albeit rather simple, species. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.29">
<s n="s1.4;p4.29">Cell fate is specified by two processes very early on in embryogenesis. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.29">Firstly, a number of invariant asymmetric cell divisions, in which important regulatory molecules are being unequally distributed along the cleavage furrow, thus creating daughter blastomeres with different developmental fates. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.29">Secondly, there are different cell-cell interactions which have reproducible invariant patterns in every individual as well. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.29">In cell-cell interactions, a certain cell's signal will either alter the fate of an adjacent cell, or it will trigger polarisation of this cell, resulting in asymmetric division.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.29">
<s n="s1.2;p5.29">The majority of genes involved in early cell fate specification are maternal effect genes; so called because these genes are transcribed from the maternal genome and are delivered to the early embryo by its mother instead of being transcribed from the zygotic genome. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.29">And while the effects of mutations in these genes are not visible in the mother, the offspring will often have an easily distinguishable phenotype. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.29">
<s n="s1.5;p6.29">This essay focuses on a number of these genes and their protein products, as well as regulation of their expression. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.29">The first cell division of the P0 zygote is already asymmetrical, resulting in a bigger anterior founder cell called AB and a smaller posterior stem cell called P1. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.29">Each of the early cell divisions produces one somatic founder cell, denoted AB, EMS etc, and one stem cell, denoted P1 to P4, which is a germline precursor. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.29">The stem cell lineage always divides so at to produce another stem cell and a new anterior founder cell, as can be seen in fig. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Setting Up The Initial Asymmetries In The Embryo</head>
<p n="p7.29">
<s n="s1.4;p7.29">There are two autonomous processes that take place at the one-cell stage, which are important in asymmetrical division. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.29">One is determination of the posterior pole of the P0 blastomere and the second concerns asymmetrical localisation of the PAR proteins, which are vital for maintaining the initially established asymmetry and cell fate specification of the daughter blastomeres AB and P1. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.29">One sign of asymmetry is the migration of P granules, which are ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in specifying the germline and are randomly dispersed throughout the cytoplasm at the early one-cell stage. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.29">The P granules can be found migrating to the posterior axis shortly after fertilisation, so that they enter only the P1 blastomere formed from the posterior cytoplasm. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="underlined">The Sperm Cue</head>
<p n="p8.29">
<s n="s1.3;p8.29">When a sperm enters the oocyte in the spermathecum, the centrosome associated with its pronucleus initiates cytoplasmic streaming which localises the paternal pronucleus to the nearest end of the oocyte, which adopts an oval shape due to egg shell constraints, thus determining the posterior pole of the zygote. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.29">Both maternal and paternal pronuclei move to the zygote's centre and the first mitotic spindle is formed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.29">During anaphase, the spindle becomes displaced to the posterior, resulting in an unequal division.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.29">
<s n="s1.5;p9.29">The sperm pronucleus/centrosome complex (SPCC) seems to specify the anteroposterior axis, involving NMY-2, a nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain and MLC-4, a myosin light chain, by inducing cytoplasmic streaming and a process called pseudocleavage that involves ruffling of the anterior cortex of the embryo while the posterior cortex remains smooth. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.29">These processes are thought to localise the PAR proteins (see fig. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.29">2) to specific areas of the zygote, which is important for establishing and maintaining the anteroposterior axis, but it is not known how PAR proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton or the myosin. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.29">But it has been found, that the C terminus of PAR-1 binds NMY-2, so there must clearly be some sort of interaction. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.29">Also, mutations of <hi rend="italic">nmy-2</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mlc-4</hi> result in defects in the localisation of PAR-3, PAR-2 and P granules.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.29">Mitotic spindle alignment with the anteroposterior axis in P0 is also dyein and dynactin dependant. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.29">Posterior displacement results from unequal pulling forces and requires the PAR-2 and PAR-3 proteins since these seem to position the DEP domain protein LET-99. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.29">LET-99 is localised in a narrow band along the posterior cortex and it has been shown that LET-99 weakens microtubule interactions with the cortex via dyein, resulting in a stronger net pull from the posterior cortex on the posterior centrosome, which contributes to posterior displacement of the P0 spindle. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.29">The DEP domain in LET-99 might also spatially regulate the uniformly cortical and centrosomal G subunits GOA-1 and GPA-16 to influence asymmetric spindle movement.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> </s>

<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0062c-form.001"/>During the first phase, the sperm asters at one end of the embryo exclude the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC3 complex from the posterior cortex. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p11.29">Close association of the centrosome and astral microtubules with the cortex excludes PAR-3 from the posterior pole. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p11.29">The exclusion of PAR-6 from the posterior also involves PAR-5 and the non-muscle myosin NMY-2, which prevents PAR-6 from sensing the sperm cue. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p11.29">It allows PAR-2 to sense this displacement and accumulate at the posterior pole. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p11.29">Subsequently PAR-1 accumulates, which is responsible for the correct asymmetrical distribution of MEX-5, MEX-6 and PIE-1 during the establishment phase. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p12.29">The conserved small G protein, CDC-42 is thought to be necessary to maintain polarity as well, by binding to PAR-6 and activating the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex by promoting PKC-3 kinase activity.<hi rend="sup">2, 4</hi> </s>

<p n="p13.29">
<s n="s1.3;p13.29">MEX-5 and MEX-6 are some of the proteins that act downstream of the PAR proteins in establishing protein asymmetries, but do not affect spindle asymmetry in one-cell embryos. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p25.29">POS-1 is a protein that binds to the SCR of glp-1 and is thought to negatively regulate the translation of glp-1 in P2 by shortening its poly(A) tail. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p25.29">SPN-4 is an RNP-type RNA-binding protein whose interaction with the TCR seems required for the translation of glp-1. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p25.29">The translation of maternal glp-1 mRNA is suppressed in posterior parts of the embryo where POS-1 is very abundant, but it is turned on in the anterior half, where the concentration of SPN-4, which is abundant in both the posterior and anterior parts of the embryo, predominates over the abundance of POS-1. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p25.29">Interestingly, GLP-1 is not translated in oocytes or one-cell embryos which do have abundant SPN-4 but not POS-1, thus there must be yet another type of temporal regulation preventing SPN-4 from activating translation at this early stage.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> </s>

<p n="p26.29">
<s n="s1.5;p26.29">APX-1 is a membrane-bound protein similar to the Drosophila Delta protein and the <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> LAG-2 protein, and was found to be one of the ligands of GLP-1 involved in P2 signalling at the 4-cell stage. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.29">While the maternal apx-1 mRNA is present in nearly every blastomere at this stage, its expression is restricted to P1 and P2 blastomeres, in a way similar to the localisation of the PAR-3 protein, thus it could be regulated in a similar fashion. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p26.29">POS-1 seems to be positively involved in the translational regulation, while SPN-4 acts negatively on apx-1 expression. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p26.29">GLP-1 and APX-1 have nearly reciprocal patterns of expression. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p26.29">Furthermore, pie-1 mutants, which can fail to specify the fate of ABp, have defects in the localisation of APX-1.<hi rend="sup">17, 18</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.1;p27.29">At the 12-cell stage, the MS blastomere provides a signal that is necessary for determining left-right asymmetry in cell fate and the development of neighbouring ABa descendants, which form most of the anterior half of the pharynx. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.29">
<s n="s1.4;p28.29">Since both P2 and MS signal to GLP-1, which has to be expressed by ABa descendants, it was thought that the signals originating from P2 and MS might be identical or at least related proteins. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.29">But while APX-1 is present at high levels in P2 at the 4-cell stage, neither embryonic nor maternal APX-1 was detected in the MS blastomere at any stage of embryogenesis. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.29">Other related proteins could not be assigned as MS signals either, and as of yet the ligand for GLP-1 in MS signalling has not been identified. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.29">There is a possibility that zygotic instead of maternal gene activity in the MS blastomere is needed for the expression or activation of a ligand for GLP-1 at this stage.<hi rend="sup">15, 16</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.6;p29.29">A lot of research has been done in order to understand the mechanisms that establish asymmetry and specify cell fate in the early <hi rend="italic">C. elegans</hi> embryo. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p29.29">The major conclusion the processes are achieved via arises through a combination of asymmetric cell divisions and cell-cell interactions. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p29.29">It has been found that a whole range of maternal effect genes play a vital role in early embryogenesis but it is not clear in all cases exactly how the maternal information acts on the expression of zygotic genes and in which way these genes participate in the processes described. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p29.29">Further analysis of zygotic gene mutations is needed to elucidate this. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p29.29">Furthermore, there remain several gaps in our knowledge about how the various maternal factors interact with one another. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p29.29">The spatial and temporal regulation of expression of any given maternal effect gene often seems to be dependant on a number of other maternal effect gene products, so it should be interesting to shed light on the connections between regulation of different maternal genes in different stages of early embryogenesis.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> </s>
