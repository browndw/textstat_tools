<head>Visiting Friends or Relatives (VFR) Market </head>
<p n="p1.35">
<s n="s1.4;p1.35">Visiting Friends or Relatives (VFR) is an important form in travel and tourism market. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.35">It is found to be one of the most frequent reasons for domestic pleasure travel especially in Europe and US (Lehto, Morrison and O'Leary, 2000; Paci, 1994) and the major reason for family travel trips (Mason, 1987). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.35">VFR comprises a considerable number of international travels, especially for countries with 'a strong immigration tradition' (Paci, 1994; Seaton and Palmer, 1997). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.35">In addition, Hay (1996) and King (1996) propose VFR travel is developing more quickly than other forms of travel in mature travel destination such as the UK. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.35">
<s n="s1.6;p2.35">VFR market is used to be neglected in both tourism marketing and academic research (King, 1996; Morrison and O'Leary, 1995; Seaton, 1994), Moscardoal. (2000) point out the view has been changed, instead, there's a rising trend to notice the increasing market. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.35">It is reported that VFR accounted for a large portion of 42% of all domestic trips in British tourism (Denman, 1988). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.35">Up today Seaton and Palmer (1997) found that VFR market is becoming a rapid growing category in UK tourism industry. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.35">Research shows international VFRs to the UK grows 18% from 1998 to 2002, and it is the only category that not be affected growing in the wake of food and mouth disease and 11 September in 2001 (National Statistics, 2003). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.35">Statistics also show that both international and domestic VFRs contribute more to towns or cities outside London and less seasonality (Visit Britain, 2004). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.35">As Jackson (1990) identifies that VFRs representing a segment of international travellers that bring significant benefits to local areas and communities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.35">
<s n="s1.8;p3.35">Clearly, VFR is becoming an important market to British tourism, and some characteristics have been drawn by scholars and help understanding. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p3.35">It is examined that host plays a significant role in inviting VFR visitors, planning itinerary, deciding where to stay and what to do (Seaton and Palmer, 1997; Paci, 1994; McKercher, 1996). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p3.35">Many ways are suggested to segment the market (Seaton and Tagg, 1995; Yuan et al., 1995; Meis et al., 1995; Braunlich and Nadkarni, 1995; Hay, 1996; White, 1996; Morrison et al.,1995; King, 1994, 1996; King and Gamage, 1994). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.35">A widely recognized one is a typology of VFR developed by Moscardoal. (2000). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.35">It summarized five essential variables which are VFR as a travel activity or motive (sector), domestic/international VFR (scope), short-haul/long-haul VFR (effort), staying with friends or relatives (AFR)/staying in commercial accommodation establishments (NAFR) (accommodation used), and VF/VR/VFVR<ref target="BAWE_3017a-ftnote.001"/> (focus of visit). </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.35">Furthermore, VisitBritain (2004) provides an insight to the VFR market in Britain. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.35">This is a youth market based on the fact that 59% of international VF trips were made by people around 25 - 35 years old and majority of visitors are female. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.35">60% VFR visitors are from Europe, Canada and USA are big VFR market to the UK due to the tradition of immigration. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_3017a-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">VF, visiting friends; VR, visiting relatives; VFR, visiting friends and relatives </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.35">
<s n="s1.3;p4.35">The report notice there's one of the biggest obstacles for people not making a VFR trip is they are not sure what to do even though they are invited by host. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.35">It is suggested that if there's an event during visiting, more potential VFR tourists will come. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.35">The problem brings up a niche market to capture and marketing implications to consider. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>The Treasure Houses of England</head>
<p n="p5.35">
<s n="s1.3;p5.35">The Treasure Houses of England are ten most magnificent privately owned historic estates in England, offering visitors a living history of the great families, culture and landscape for 1000 years (Treasure Houses of England Website). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.35">Most houses are still homes of the families. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.35">The SWOT analysis shows problems they have. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_3017a-fig.001"/>
<p n="p6.35">
<s n="s1.3;p6.35">VisitBritain (2003) investigated that the reduction of oversea visits becomes one of the biggest problem that affecting visits to attractions, particularly US and European markets. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.35">And the followed factor is competition. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.35">So the Treasure Houses must find themselves a unique proposition and target a niche market - VFR market. </s>
</p>
</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">TARGET AUDIENCE </head>
<p n="p7.35">
<s n="s1.1;p7.35">The marketing campaign has two target audiences: </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.35">
<s n="s1.1;p8.35">Host - resident of England, including local resident, who live within about half an hour's drive from the site; regional residents, who live from a distance of two hours' driving or more, make day visits away from home </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.35">
<s n="s1.1;p9.35">Overseas VFRs from North America and Europe, 25-34, VF/VR/VFVR, VFR is not the sole purpose of travel but a travel activity. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">OBJECTIVES </head>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.35">
<s n="s1.1;p10.35">To build a image of the Houses are treasures of England and make local residents to be proud of </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.35">
<s n="s1.1;p11.35">To increase the frequency of local visits, by 10% in tourist number in one year time </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.35">
<s n="s1.1;p12.35">To increase visits of host and VFRs to different Treasure Houses through the Treasure House of England joint promotion programme </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.35">
<s n="s1.1;p13.35">To improve the communication between oversea visitor's by Internet and motive their VFR trip to visit </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.35">
<s n="s1.1;p14.35">To build the database of local residents and reach more oversea VFR visitors via host </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">STRATEGY </head>
<p n="p15.35">
<s n="s1.2;p15.35">For VFR purposes, oversea visits to England (excluding London 42%) accounts for 49% of the total number in the UK (VisitBritain, 2003). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.35">Thus, strategic objectives of the campaign are primarily to encourage visits from host and VFRs in England to the Treasure Houses, at the same time help the Treasure Houses capture this niche VFR market. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.35">
<s n="s1.2;p16.35">Beioley (1997) recommended that active promotion to local residents is a way to gain VFR visitors to attraction and Poriaal. (2003) pointed out that people are more likely to visit a heritage site again if their emotional experiences were involved. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.35">Thus, in this campaign, the key is to create emotional ties between attractions and visitors. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.35">
<s n="s1.3;p17.35">The strategy is to enhance emotional bond between hosts and treasure houses; the other one is to create emotional ties between VFR visitors and treasure houses through hosts. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.35">"From Home to Home" - It has two meanings: to host, be advocate of their local houses, see it as their own home; to VFRs, they leave home to home in England, and then visit 'home of the great families' - the Treasure Houses of England. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.35">It creates a sweet perception to VFR trip and visit. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">ACTION PLANS </head>
<p n="p18.35">
<s n="s1.1;p18.35">With a theme 'from home to home', marketing activities will be conducted from the aspects of product, pricing, distribution and communication mix. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head>Product </head>
<p n="p19.35">
<s n="s1.8;p19.35">Product is the visitor experience, and it starts from impression before visit (Johns and Clark, 1994). </s>
<s n="s2.8;p19.35">However, many tourists barely know something about the place (Middleton with Clarke, 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p19.35">Thus, Treasure Houses should begin visitors' satisfactory experiences by providing aesthetic and informative brochure and website about the attractions and helpful information such as how to get there. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p19.35">During visit, quality of services is essential such as friendly tour guide, nice gift shop assistants, as well as facilities etc. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p19.35">To manage a good customer relationship, attraction can keep contact with tourists (if they like) after visits, informing what happens at houses and inviting them to come. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p19.35">Moreover, Strauss and Lord (2002) indicated 'history is a popular theme for recreational travel'. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p19.35">To make the historical attraction young and fun, Treasure Houses can bring a history of authenticity alive by different events, shows. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p19.35">Finally, a good brand image is aimed to set up, like National Trust, English Heritage Properties. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Price </head>
<p n="p20.35">
<s n="s1.4;p20.35">Average standard price of the Treasure Houses for adult is £11.27. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.35">It is slightly higher than other historic properties and attractions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.35">Even though it is acceptable to most tourists for first time visit, it seems not favourable to repeated visitors and host accompanying VFRs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.35">Besides this short - term promotion, some annual pass ticket can be promoted to increase frequency of existing visitors. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Distribution </head>
<p n="p21.35">
<s n="s1.5;p21.35">ICT becomes the theme of distribution in tourism. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.35">So it is suggested to redevelop the website of Treasure Houses before campaign. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.35">The advertising on VisitBritain will drive many visitors to check Treasure Houses' site; unfortunately, the current website is very empty and can only leading visitors to its member's site without any other information. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.35">It makes visitors feel incoherent and lack of trust. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.35">Furthermore, the site should build a database of customers in order to better segment audience and conduct direct marketing (on line) in future. </s>
