<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Discussion</head>
<p n="p15.20">
<s n="s1.3;p15.20">Our standard ovalbumin and purified ovalbumin had differing numbers reactive thiol groups in the presence of SDS. This may well be due to the accuracy of purification of the ovalbumin. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.20">With contamination of the purified ovalbumin by other proteins from the original egg white compound the absorbance figures may have been altered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.20">This in turn would have led to inaccuracies in the calculation of the number of reactive thiol groups. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.20">
<s n="s1.3;p16.20">Both figures 1 and 2 show differing, but constant absorbencies for ovalbumin without SDS present, this indicates that there is no reaction occurring. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.20">In the presence of SDS both solutions show a large increase in absorbency as the reaction time increases, showing it must be SDS that causes the reaction to take place. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.20">It is also shown by the fact that our standard ovalbumin and purified ovalbumin had 0 reactive thiol groups in the absence of SDS. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.20">
<s n="s1.5;p17.20">Sodium dodecyl sulphate is an anionic detergent, which denatures proteins by wrapping around the polypeptide backbone. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.20">Detergents are surfactants that contain a hydrophobic portion, which is soluble in oil-like solutions, and a hydrophilic portion, which is soluble in water. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.20">This characteristic results in the formation of stable micelles with hydrophobic cores in an aqueous solution. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.20">In this reaction, the presence of SDS denatures the ovalbumin by disrupting the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions, therefore breaking down the quaternary structure of the protein. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p17.20">This allows the DTNB to bind to the free thiol groups, causing the increase in absorbance as the solution becomes more and more yellow in appearance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.20">
<s n="s1.6;p18.20">In order to determine if the denaturation of ovalbumin by urea or SDS is a reversible reaction, the denaturation agent must first be removed from the solution. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.20">Conventional methods for detergent removal include hydrophobic adsorption, gel chromatography, dialysis, ion-exchange chromatography, and precipitation techniques. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.20">Having removed the detergent, the protein will refold. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.20">As shown by the Anfinsen experiment the polypeptide sequence determines the folding and therefore the three dimensional structure. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.20">As the polypeptide sequence is unaltered refolding can occur through the process of nucleation aggregation and compaction. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.20">In order to test that the protein was no longer denatured, the absorbency of the solution at 412nm could be measured and compared with the graph in figure 1 above, it should match the plot of standard ovalbumin in the absence of SDS. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.20">
<s n="s1.2;p19.20">To measure the concentration of DTNB in a solution of unknown concentration, the above experiment could be carried out using a known concentration of thiol groups. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.20">This would allow the concentration of DTNB to be calculated, as there is a 1:1 ratio of DTNB molecules (and therefore concentration) to the number of thiol molecules. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.20">
<s n="s1.2;p20.20">The determination of the number of thiol groups by DTNB is carried out at pH> 7.5 because the extinction coefficient is strongly pH dependent at pH values more acidic than 7.5. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.20">With an altered pH the maximal extinction may be altered, meaning that the absorbency figures will be wrong. </s>
