<s n="s1.3;p5.21">In the practice, subjects are asked to perform three different body postures: standing upright, sitting and supine; and blood pressure and heart rate are recorded. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.21">The results showed a tendency of decrease blood pressure and heart rate when subject change their body posture form standing to sitting, and form sitting to supine. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.21">Although all five subjects show a tendency of decreasing blood pressure and heart rate, the degree of change is closely related to the rate of baroreceptor reflex of the subject. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.21">
<s n="s1.4;p6.21">Baroreceptors are located in the upper thorax and the neck, known as the carotid sinus baroreceptor and the aortic baroreceptor. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.21">As the blood pressure increase, the baroreceptors are activated and action potentials are generated and travels along the Vagus nerve or Hering's nerve, to the tractus solitarius of the medulla. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.21">The secondary signals inhibit the vasoconstrictor centre and excite the Vagal centre. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.21">Those changes will elicit two next effects: 1) vasodilatation thoughtout the peripheral circulatory system and 2) decreased heart rate and strength of heart contraction. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.21">
<s n="s1.5;p7.21">This reflex is very important in the homeostasis. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.21">It is essential to maintain relatively constant arterial pressure when a person sits after having been lying down. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.21">Immediately upon standing, the arterial pressure in the head and upper body tends to fall. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.21">This marked reduction of blood pressure could cause loss of consciousness. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.21">The baroreceptor reflex mechanism helps the bring the blood pressure and heart rate back to normal level and therefore maintaining a sustainable cardiac output. </s>

<s n="s10.17;p8.21">As the ventricle is uniformly depolarized, the ST segment should be isoelectric. </s>

<s n="s12.17;p8.21">Location of ST segment is characterised by different heart abnormalities. </s>
