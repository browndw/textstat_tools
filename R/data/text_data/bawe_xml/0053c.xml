<p n="p1.63">
<s n="s1.5;p1.63">The sample data concerns the marks of 408 students obtained in first year statistics exam (<hi rend="italic">qtmark)</hi> and a plethora of variables which might affect the marks of these students majority aged 19. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.63">A summary of descriptive statistic in Appendix 1 shows that the average marks obtained was 64.9%. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.63">The median was also 65% while the minimum and maximum were 9% and 95% respectively. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.63">A standard deviation of 13.06 implies that majority of the results vary between 51.8% and 77.9%. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.63">The correlation matrix in Appendix 1 shows that some notable variables with positive effect on exam results include ability, attendance and time spent on revision while variables like expenditure on alcohol and coming from the UK are found to have a negative impact on <hi rend="italic">qtmark.</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.63">
<s n="s1.9;p2.63">Amongst all the variables, ability was found to be the most significant variable affecting qtmark as demonstrated by its high correlation of 0.37. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.63">The fact that the ability of all students is normally distributed suggests a fair and adequate sample for regression. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.63">According to Romer<ref target="BAWE_0053c-ftnote.001"/>, generally students with good attendance perform better in examinations. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.63">This concurs with the strong positive correlation of 0.28 and 0.24 between <hi rend="italic">qtmarks</hi> and attending classes (<hi rend="italic">attc</hi>) and lectures (<hi rend="italic">attl</hi>) respectively in our data set. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.63">Most of the students attended an approximate mean of 80% for both lectures and classes. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.63">There is a slight disparity in the data set because there is a weak negative correlation of 0.006 between the proportion of revision lectures attended (<hi rend="italic">attr)</hi> and the test result. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.63">This could be attributed to the low mean proportion of revision lectures attended, 47%. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.63">Nevertheless, when <hi rend="italic">attr</hi> was tested<ref target="BAWE_0053c-ftnote.002"/> it was found to have a positive impact on qtmark. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.63">For students who have been consistently working hard, as evident from the number of A-grades obtained at A-level (<hi rend="italic">alevelsa</hi>) which is also positively related (correlation of 0.22) to <hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi>, the higher positive correlation of 0.091 compared to 0.06( <hi rend="italic">hrsqt1)</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0053c-ftnote.003"/> proves that more time spent on revision (<hi rend="italic">hrsqt</hi>) would result in higher marks. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p5.63">Table 2.1 in Appendix 2 shows that there is a positive relationship between (<hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi>) mark in first year statistic exam and the (<hi rend="italic">attr</hi>) proportion of revision lectures attended; if attr increased by one percent then qtmark would increase by 0.002263 percent. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.63">If attr were zero, qtmark would be about 64.73999%.In addition, 0.0049% of the variation in qtmark is explained by attr because the R<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0053c-form.002"/> value is about 0.000049. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.63">In a bivariate model, the R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> value is a good measure for how good of a fit the model truly is; the higher the R <hi rend="sup">2</hi> value, the better the fit for the model. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p6.63">Next, test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between <hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi> and <hi rend="italic">attr</hi>, that is, the true slope coefficient β<hi rend="sub">1</hi> = 0. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.63">Holding all other variables constant, the estimated value of coefficient β<hi rend="sub">1</hi> is 0.002263. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.63">Under the null hypothesis, we observe that the <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-value is 0.129684 and the <hi rend="italic">p</hi>-value of obtaining such a <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-value is 0.8969. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.63">In other words, accept the null hypothesis that <hi rend="italic">attr</hi> has no effect on <hi rend="italic">qtmark.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.63">Under the same null hypothesis that the true slope coefficient is zero, the <hi rend="italic">F</hi>-value is 0.016818. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.63">If we square the <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-value of the slope coefficient of <hi rend="italic">attr,</hi> we will see that this will be the <hi rend="italic">F</hi>-value. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.63">This shows the close relationship between the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">F</hi> statistic. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.63">This can only be true when the degree of freedom for the <hi rend="italic">F</hi>-statistic is 1, which includes this particular regression. </s>

<s n="s5.11;p8.63">Table 2.2 in Appendix 2 shows that there is still a positive linear relationship between <hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi> and <hi rend="italic">attr</hi> because a 1% increase in <hi rend="italic">attr</hi> will result in a 0.105959% increase in <hi rend="italic">qtmark</hi>, given that all other explanatory variables <hi rend="italic">(hrsqt and ability)</hi> are held constant. </s>
