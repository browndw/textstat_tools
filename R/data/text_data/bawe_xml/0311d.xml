<head>
<hi rend="bold">Figure 5</hi> A coherent beam of light is emitted onto a beam splitter (usually a half silvered mirror). One path has a phase-shifter the other does not. Both paths are reflected back onto another beam splitter through Pockels cells before being recombined and measured by the detection screen.</head>
</figure>
<p n="p21.43">
<s n="s1.7;p21.43">In this experiment, performed by the University of Maryland and University of Munich the half silvered mirror acts like two slits, a single photon decides whether to go one way or the other. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p21.43">The phase shifter acting on one of the paths will say which way the photon went if we decide to measure its phase, which is a wave property. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p21.43">The Pockels cells are devices that detect photons and can tell us which way the photon went if they are turned on. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p21.43">When turned off the photon passes through unperturbed. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p21.43">Pockels cells can be turned on and off within 9ns. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p21.43">In the actual experiment, the path from the first beam splitter to the detector screen was 4.3m, which takes 14.5ns for light to travel. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p21.43">Therefore, the Pockels cells could be turned on or off <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the photon has gone through the beam splitter and chosen its path. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.43">
<s n="s1.4;p22.43">With the Pockels cells turned off the path information is hidden and the light interferes, when we know which way the photon has gone there is no interference. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p22.43">These are exactly the same results as when the path information was measured at the slits, except the photon has to decide which way to go before anyone knows whether to measure its path or not. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p22.43">The astonishing fact is that the photons have this kind of precognition. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p22.43">This experiment has not been performed with other particles, but there is no reason to doubt the results would be any different. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.43">
<s n="s1.3;p23.43">Due to the lensing effect gravity has on light it is possible for a very bright light source (such as quasar) to be behind a massive galaxy and for the light from the star to travel both sides of the galaxy before reaching us. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.43">In a popular thought experiment the light could be recombined and an interference pattern made (realistically the coherence time for the light source is much shorter than the difference in time for the two paths so interference would not be possible) or a telescope pointed at either side of the galaxy thus revealing which way the photon went. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.43">According to the results of the experiments the photons will decide how to behave millions of years before they are detected depending on whether an astronomer decides to turn his Pockels cells on or not. </s>

<p n="p25.43">
<s n="s1.2;p25.43">This single particle also must interfere with itself but every measurement of it reveals it to be localised and have particle properties. </s>

</p>
<p n="p26.43">
<s n="s1.1;p26.43">However, the delayed choice experiment shows you can measure the choice of path after it has been made and that tells the particle back in time how to behave. </s>
