<p n="p1.9">
<s n="s1.7;p1.9">Initially these poems may seem similar. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.9">They both explore coming to terms with loss and use poetic language and techniques throughout. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.9">Yet structurally they are extremely different. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.9">Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of this is in terms of form. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.9">'The Kaleidoscope' is in the form of a sonnet, as it consists of fourteen lines mainly in iambic pentameter. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.9">Its structure is closest to that of a Shakespearian sonnet, although the rhyme scheme of the first quatrain (ABBA) digresses slightly from the standard ABAB. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.9">'The Kaleidoscope' also differs from a traditional sonnet in terms of subject matter; instead of being joyful and celebratory, its subject matter is more sombre. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.9">
<s n="s1.5;p2.9">The terminal couplet of a sonnet has a "usual tendency to summarise or comment on the quatrains, and hence to moralise" (Lennard, 2005, p.49). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.9">To an extent this is true here, as the concluding couplet of 'The Kaleidoscope' is more generalised than the rest of the poem. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.9">There is a shift from a largely personal experience ("Offering <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> flesh, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> soul, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> skin"), to a more detached and collective statement in line thirteen ("Grief wrongs <hi rend="italic">us</hi> so"). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.9">However, unlike the more traditional Shakespearian sonnets, there is a lack of moral resolution. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.9">The poem ends on "not knowing why", which captures the incomprehensible nature of death. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.9">
<s n="s1.5;p3.9">On the other hand, 'Underworld' is written in free verse. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.9">Therefore the reader is not distracted by a rhyme scheme; significant words are emphasised by enjambment and caesura as opposed to end rhyme. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.9">For example there is strong enjambment at the end of the third line; "must I let you go / down alone into each night as winter". </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.9">This emphasises 'go', a syllable that is also stressed rhythmically due to the trochaic meter of the second half of the line. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.9">In addition, the phrase 'must I let you go' has a different meaning when separated from the following line, as it implies more finality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.9">
<s n="s1.5;p4.9">Another prominent instance of enjambment in 'Underworld' occurs between the second and third lines of the second stanza; "to lie still on the ice, to know this is / not for ever...". </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.9">In this case, 'not' is emphasised at the beginning of the third line. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.9">It is a key word in this context, because it reinforces the theme of transience that is central to the poem. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.9">In addition, the tension between the syntax and the line break helps to create suspense, similar to that in the fifth and sixth lines of 'The Kaleidoscope'; "Or, turning from the landing, I might find / My presence watched...". </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.9">In both cases the reader is urged onwards by a sense of anticipation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.9">
<s n="s1.8;p5.9">Throughout 'The Kaleidoscope', structure is imposed primarily by end rhyme, metre and sound patterning. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.9">The phrase "my hands become a tray" echoes the "bearing a tray" at the end of the first line. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.9">These lines are similarly constructed, consisting of ten syllables mainly in iambic pentameter. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.9">This technique could be referred to as a scheme, as it increases the regularity of the language and adds structure to the piece. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.9">It implies that the persona of the poem is subconsciously comparing his life before and after his loss. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.9">The second instance is followed by an example of synecdoche; "Offering me, my flesh, my soul, my skin". </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.9">The repetition of 'my' replaces the focus on 'you' and 'your' (for example "your books" and "your kaleidoscope") earlier in the poem. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.9">Here the persona lists specific elements of himself, both physical and spiritual, and together these techniques reinforce that he is all he has left. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.9">
<s n="s1.7;p6.9">Similarly, the sound patterning in 'Underworld' can influence our general understanding and impression of the poem. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.9">Greenlaw uses sibilance in both stanzas, for example "swallowed six pomegranate seeds" in the first stanza and "in something of summer" in the second. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.9">There is also assonance in lines three and four of the first stanza - the sound of 'go' is repeated in 'alone' in the next line. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.9">In addition there is internal rhyme in the fourth line of the second stanza connecting "through" and "you". </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.9">Significantly the 'o' sound of 'go' and 'alone' creates a melancholic feel in the first half of the poem. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p6.9">On the other hand, the 'oo' sounds in the second half and the sibilance are soothing. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p6.9">This adds to the reassuring tone in the second stanza. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.9">
<s n="s1.7;p7.9">Although there is an absence of end rhyme and regular metre in 'Underworld', the language is linked instead by symbolism and imagery. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.9">The first stanza is an allegory for the Greek myth of Hades and Persephone, illustrated by the title and the reference to "six pomegranate seeds". </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.9">It relates to the rest of the poem in terms of the main themes, as these are primarily death (or mortality) and transience. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.9">In Greek mythology, the underworld is seen as being underground and therefore physically separated from life. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.9">It is often linked to winter, and this is depicted as cold and lonely in the poem, through the mention of 'alone' in line four and the image of a 'freezing' path. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.9">In contrast, summer represents warmth and life in the second stanza, as it thaws the ice. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.9">This contrast between the two seasons is in turn related to the idea of transience, because neither one is permanent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.9">
<s n="s1.3;p8.9">Finally, the poems are similar thematically in that death is an underlying concern, although there is a difference in the choice of language used. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.9">The phrase "must I let you go / down alone into each night as winter" (lines 3-4, stanza 1) in 'Underworld' is reminiscent of Dylan Thomas' 'Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night', which he wrote during the critical illness of his father. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.9">'Good night' is a common euphemism for death, and probably originated from Shakespeare's '<hi rend="italic">Hamlet'</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.9">
<s n="s1.4;p9.9">In contrast, Dunn approaches the subject of death in more explicit terms in 'The Kaleidoscope'; "looking in / at where you died." (line 11). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.9">There is strong caesura after 'died', forcing the reader to pause and absorb the impact of this blunt expression. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.9">Using hardened and upfront language is a characteristic of Dunn's poetry, though more apparent in his earlier poems (Childs, 1999, p.143). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.9">Nonetheless, it could be argued that "as if preparing for a holiday" in line four of 'The Kaleidoscope' is a euphemism for dying, as it is a pleasant way of describing someone's departure. </s>
