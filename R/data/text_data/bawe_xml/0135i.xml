<s n="s1.3;p1.14">The description in the title of this essay of the capitalist social order as being antagonistic and crisis prone is not a sufficient summary of Marx's conception. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.14">His conception does not simply consist of a description of the capitalist social order, but of the notion that it is in fact antagonisms and the tendency towards crisis which constitute the very essence or actuality of capitalism. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.14">This dialectical account of the capitalist social order is what distinguishes Marx from other IPE theorists, who arguably have devoted their lives and work to reconciling the antagonisms and crises of the capitalist social order without addressing their causes. </s>

<p n="p2.14">
<s n="s1.4;p2.14">Through the use of immanent criticism<ref target="BAWE_0135i-ftnote.001"/> and historical dialecticism, Marx aimed to expose the actuality of capital, "not as a totality ossified into a thing, but a living, mobile social relation"<ref target="BAWE_0135i-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.14">The two words social and relation are key to understanding this conception. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.14">For as the essay title suggests, his conception identifies at its foundation, the social basis of the capitalist order. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.14">In other words, capitalism cannot be removed from its <hi rend="italic">human</hi> source of production and reproduction, and as with all social relations, their essence and being constitutes and relies upon antagonisms and contradictions. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p3.14">Fred Moseley argues that "the widespread criticisms of Marx's theory...are erroneous because these criticisms presume a logical method...that is fundamentally different to Marx's own logical method.<ref target="BAWE_0135i-ftnote.003"/>" To evaluate Marx's conception on a theoretical basis would therefore require an analysis of dialectical method. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p4.14">What Marx did was to expose how the profit rate was determined, and by extension of his conception of antagonism, this essay will evaluate the applicability of this conception to the observable phenomenon of the 'globalisation of capital'. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p8.14">Marx demonstrates that this is the result of the commodification of labour, making the distinction between necessary labour time - the time it takes for a worker to reproduce his or her wages, and surplus labour time - the remaining time that he or she works in a day, which as Marx argues, is the source of profit. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.14">Therefore, without the surplus labour time provided by a human worker, a capitalist can make no profit and yet as the 'bearer' of the economic law of capital, the goal and motivation of a capitalist is profit<ref target="BAWE_0135i-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
