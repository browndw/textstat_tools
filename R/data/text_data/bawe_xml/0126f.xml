<s n="s1.7;p1.26">For political playwrights and theatre groups, Realism's manifesto proved irreconcilable to their own doctrine. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.26">The inadequacies of a realist form stem chiefly from it's early inception in the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, where it garnered artistic credibility because of the emergence of strict social and natural ideologies that supported it. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.26">The theoretical kudos inferred from the works of Marx, Darwin and Taine fostered such momentum for Realism that it became (and remains) the dominant mode of artistic presentation in theatre. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.26">Yet a theory (invariably linked with the Naturalistic movement) that espouses material truth, and the stressed importance of an essentially deterministic natural formation was to be largely rejected by creators of political theatre. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.26">It is easy to understand why: the contradictions between the realist and political doctrines are varied and problematic. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.26">Creators of political theatre are essentially unable to reconcile a medium that triumphs clinical observation, a Darwinist rationale and a scientific dogma to one that, in essence, concerns cultural intervention, community action and ideological transference (outlined in Kershaw: <hi rend="italic">The Politics of Performance.</hi> </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.26">) </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.26">
<s n="s1.3;p2.26">Early examples of realism concern powerless, trapped figures regimented into their suffering by the prescribed determinations of callous natural and social formations. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.26">Such characters (Miss Julie, Oswald, Hedda Gabler) have little escape, except through withdrawing completely from the natural order by suicide. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p3.26">To posit an alternative is a chief characteristic of political plays, even those portraying dystopic and nightmarish societies. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.26">For political and social structure (unlike the natural order) is both mutable and human. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.26">And the presentation of such systems must always therefore contain the innate possibility of alternative goodness, however minutely manifest such hopes may be. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.26">
<s n="s1.5;p4.26">Contextualising Theatre Workshop's departure from social-realism reveals a series of events that fatally undermined public belief in the supremacy of science. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.26">Artistic faith in science's ability to act as a beacon of social progress was seriously damaged by the advent and subsequent use of atomic weaponry. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.26">Intellectual traitors (akin to Brecht's Galileo) had placed science firmly in the hands of the state: it seemed no longer a scholarly tool utilised to alleviate social ailments but a potential annihilator of mankind. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.26">Significant 1960's movements such as CND and the anti-Vietnam War campaign perceived science as the instrument of total human destruction. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.26">With science discredited, there was a need for alternative (and anti-realist) forms of staging. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.26">
<s n="s1.3;p5.26">But Realism, it seems, was such established theatrical dogma that to subvert it's sacrosanct formal properties was tantamount to a very grave theatrical perversion. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.26">The vehement critical and public reaction to Sarah Kane's <hi rend="italic">Blasted</hi> seemed to stem not from 'scenes of masturbation, fellatio, frottage, micturition, defecation - ah, those old familiar faeces! - </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.26">homosexual rape, eye gouging and cannibalism' (Billington, Michael: <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> newspaper, 20/01/95) so much as from an utter incomprehension of the play's non-realistic format: </s>

<quote lang="English">"the reason that the play falls apart is that there is no sense of external reality- who exactly is meant to be fighting whom out on the streets?" (Billington: 20/01/95)</quote>
<quote lang="English">"... For utterly disgusted I was by a play which appears to know no bounds of decency yet has no message to convey by way of excuse... utterly without artistic merit..." (Tinker, Jack: <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> newspaper, 19/01/05)</quote>
<p n="p6.26">
<s n="s1.9;p6.26">Critics failed to comprehend the play's structure because it transcended the single "reality" that they were used to. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.26">Kane remarked in an interview that "the best art is subversive in form <hi rend="italic">and</hi> content... </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.26">I suspect that if <hi rend="italic">Blasted</hi> had been a piece of social realism it wouldn't have been so harshly received." </s>

<s n="s5.9;p6.26">Saunders: 12) </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.26">A common complaint was that two polemical civil states, war and peace, seemed to coexist in the play. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.26">Certainly this is true: in the hotel, room service and telephones all operate normally. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.26">Outside football matches proceed with regularity and the press continues to print daily tabloid stories. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.26">Yet in our global society, such chaos and order is separated only by country borders: Kane removes any tangible boundaries and places war and peace side-by-side. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.26">
<s n="s1.5;p7.26">In many ways <hi rend="italic">Blasted</hi> is a palimpsest: underlying themes rise to the surface through the externalising effects of the explosion, which both literally and figuratively inverts the play's contents. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.26">For Ian particularly, objects already mentioned before the mortar attack reverse meaning: children (he previously mocks Cate's spastic brother) become a source of survival. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.26">A symbols of his power, a gun, is degradingly put up his anus. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.26">Gin (the cause of his rotting liver) becomes an elixir of life at the play's finale. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.26">The newspapers, thrown casually onto the bed by Ian in the first scene, are testament to his wretchedness during his blindness when he uses them to clean up his faeces. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.26">
<s n="s1.7;p8.26">Ian's actions are also the catalyst of the play's deterioration. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.26">Cate's simple statement "You're a nightmare" (II:33) prefigures <hi rend="italic">Blasted's</hi> eruption of violence. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.26">Indeed, one could read the Soldier as a facet of Ian's own persona, which is only able to materialise because of the previously committed rape: the seed becomes the tree. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.26">Such assumptions are supported by the lack of a third party, or witness, to the Soldier/Ian dialogue on stage. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.26">When Cate returns she never acknowledges the presence of a body, she merely <hi rend="italic">'steps over the body of the</hi> <hi rend="bold">Soldier <hi rend="italic"> with a glance</hi>
</hi>.' (IV: 51) </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.26">Linking a rape in a Leeds hotel with the wider effects of civil war is one of <hi rend="italic">Blasted's</hi> foremost intentions. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.26">Such comparisons are enabled principally through the decay in formal structure: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"I do think that the seeds of full-scale war can always be found in peace-time civilisation... the form is a direct parallel to the truth of the war it portrays - a traditional form is suddenly and violently disrupted by the entrance of an unexpected element that drags the characters and the play into a chaotic pit without logical explanation." (Kane, qtd. Saunders: 39, 45)</quote>
<p n="p9.26">
<s n="s1.6;p9.26">The seeming irrationality of violence in <hi rend="italic">Blasted</hi> is accompanied by no attempt at comprehension: such a dilemma is left to the audience. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.26">Yet for Littlewood and Theatre Workshop, rejection of the realistic format assumed a different motivation: a struggle to understand and render legible the confusing atrocity of the First World War. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.26">The public failure to understand why the conflict happened was resolved by Littlewood's company, who through the circus medium of the Pierrot clowns renders the conflict in term of class, economy and the tyranny of the state. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.26">Contrastingly, where Kane's structure degrades to prevent ideological explanation (instead focusing primarily on the audience as witnesses), <hi rend="italic">Oh!</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.26">
<hi rend="italic">What a lovely war</hi> is deliberately anti-realist to clarify the war's events in terms of an overriding socialist dogma. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.26">Theatre Workshop was operating under the radical precept famously established by Clifford Odets: new theatre "should shoot bullets." </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.26">
<s n="s1.1;p10.26">Kane's work, in contrast, operates in the cultural context of a post-modern society eschewed from overriding ideologies and the simple problems that accompany such doctrines: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"Her characters make no "state-of-the-nation" speeches nor are they visually representative in themselves of any political or social issues... [her] drama is in possession of an overreaching feel in it's grand attempt to make sense of the world rather than a specific event... or social agenda." (Saunders: 9,20) </quote>
<p n="p11.26">
<s n="s1.7;p11.26">Kane has a preoccupation with the proliferation of violence and the perpetuation of abuse. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.26">In the end, though, <hi rend="italic">Blasted</hi> is a play fundamentally concerned with war and hope, and the form and the characters bear the brunt of war's consequences. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.26">It is in the play's structure that the bomb resides, and it is here that the effects of the mortar attack are wreaked most savagely. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.26">The expensive hotel room in Leeds is literally blown apart, and becomes torture chamber, toilet, grave and eventually a metaphorical hell. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.26">Accompanying the physical havoc on set is the steady disintegration of form: "we move from socio-realism to surrealism, to expressionism." </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.26">(Kenyon, qtd. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p11.26">Saunders: 40) </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.26">
<s n="s1.5;p12.26">Littlewood discarded a realistic interpretation of the conflict, modelling her actors on the French Pierrot instead of soldiers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.26">By defamiliarising the actor's costume, Littlewood substituted the multitudinous anonymity of soldier-khaki with the tragicomic clown persona, whilst still retaining a degree of era authenticity ("Pierrots were all the go in those days." </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.26">(Littlewood, preface: ix)) Her principle theatrical instruments were the M.C (and the aura of improvisation he exuded) and the play's episodic structure. </s>
