<p n="p48.65">
<s n="s1.1;p48.65">The general will is at the heart of Rousseau's solution to the fundamental problem and the central concern about it lies with the issue of whether the general will can err. </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.65">
<s n="s1.2;p49.65">There is always a margin of error when drafting the general will, after all, he asserts that "it does not follow from it that the people's deliberations are always equally upright. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p49.65">One always want one's goods but one does not always see it: one can never corrupt the people but one can often cause it to be mistaken and only when it does, does it appear to want what is bad".<ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.052"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p50.65">
<s n="s1.4;p50.65">The margin of error increases when we consider the implausibility of subordination of one's private interest to public interest. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p50.65">He neglects the inclination of man to want what is good instead of willing what is good. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p50.65">After all, we are dealing with "men as they are", why would individuals not pursue their particular interests at the expense of the common good? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p50.65">The only reason he provides that avoids this situation is that individual good and common good are not mutually exclusive though he still "needs to make the step from individuals seeking that good to the collective successfully doing so".<ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.053"/> </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p51.65">
<s n="s1.2;p51.65">Furthermore, even if individuals in a society theoretically desire the public good over self interest, Rousseau fails to prove that every individual has the reasoning, judgment and information to rightly discern the public interest and vote for it. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p51.65">This is especially probable because politics is an art, not a science, the common interests is felt, not calculated. <ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.054"/> </s>

<p n="p52.65">
<s n="s1.11;p52.65">Most importantly, the general will itself is an ambiguous intangible concept. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p52.65">Similar to Hegel's rational organic state, it is not an empirical item discoverable by a simple majority vote that can be discerned by any electoral measures. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p52.65">Rousseau is weak on saying what a general will should include even though he covered extensively on what it should exclude. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p52.65">He does not give examples of the political institutions or society he thought necessary to embody and realize it. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p52.65">Who are the people to decide the general will? </s>
<s n="s6.11;p52.65">How would one know and why should that answer be preferred to another? </s>
<s n="s7.11;p52.65">What sort of agendas should be decided? </s>
<s n="s8.11;p52.65">What should be on the agenda and what should be omitted? </s>
<s n="s9.11;p52.65">Theoretically a general will can exist but logically speaking, the ideas of generality and will are mutually exclusive. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p52.65">Will, whatever its crudity as a psychological construct, is characteristically a concept of individuality, of particularity; it is only metaphorically that the will can be spoken of as general. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p52.65">Hence it becomes only a model of perfection. </s>

<head>(b) The lawgiver </head>
<p n="p53.65">
<s n="s1.3;p53.65">In the words of Rousseau, the lawgiver is an "extraordinary man in the state"; he is to be aware of the passions that animate man yet not be subjected to those passions himself because if he were, he would not provide the guidance necessary for the people. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p53.65">Rousseau presents him as one with many tasks and responsibilities but fail to explain how he is going to perform all of them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p53.65">After all, does such a mystical figure exist in reality? </s>
</p>
<p n="p54.65">
<s n="s1.3;p54.65">Even if he exists, where is he to be found? </s>
<s n="s2.3;p54.65">For someone with such a stature and knowledge, he must have been someone from another polity who has already been reshaped by participation in a political civil order. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p54.65">But it leads to the same problem of circularity of which the lawgiver is meant to resolve: how did the people of the lawgiver's native country get themselves guided to just laws? <ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.055"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p55.65">
<s n="s1.1;p55.65">Hence, it is questionable whether the lawgiver is a plausible genius in reality. </s>

<head>(c) Freedom</head>
<p n="p56.65">
<s n="s1.3;p56.65">Rousseau admits in the last four chapters of <hi rend="italic">The Social Contract</hi> that "freedom is not a fruit of every climate, and it is not therefore within the capacity of every people" which downplays the plausible success of laws that are representative of the general will. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p56.65">Indeed, he shifts his focus from the achievement of individual freedom to how differing traits and circumstances of "a people" affect their receptivity to law. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p56.65">Such factors will include differences in "time of maturity", "size and population" and habits and characteristics of people. <ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.056"/> </s>

<p n="p57.65">
<s n="s1.2;p57.65">Indeed, Rousseau contends that small countries are most conducive to individual freedom. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p57.65">The inverse relation between extent of freedom and size of country arises the "more the social bond is stretched, the slacker it becomes".<ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.057"/> </s>

<p n="pn2.2">
<s n="s1.2;pn2.2">To put it simply, if I as private citizen obey myself as sovereign in a state of 10 000 citizens, I contribute 1/10 000 to the sovereign authority, yet experience its full constraints. </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn2.2">Hence, the larger the state, the more disproportionate the relationship between my obedience as subject and my role as sovereign in prescribing a law to myself, by extension, freedom and legitimacy is more easily achieved in small states. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p58.65">
<s n="s1.4;p58.65">Linked to the notion of freedom is the accusation raised against strands of tyranny in Rousseau's theory. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p58.65">Some totalitarian aspects include his doctrines on the civil religion "to make the people think they want what some have decided they ought to want"<ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.058"/>, the abuse of power of the lawgiver and the death penalty who could be imposed on anyone who does not adhere to the general will. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p58.65">It seems plausible that the rule of the majority could lead to the tyranny of the majority, resulting in the coercion of minority groups, as evident in the spirit of Robespierre and the vanguard party of Lenin. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p58.65">Clearly, as J W Chapman stated, it is a fine example of ""achieving liberal ideas by totalitarian means"<ref target="BAWE_0137i-ftnote.059"/> of which the intentions may be right but the means may be misguided. </s>

<p n="p59.65">
<s n="s1.2;p59.65">Although Rousseau suggested some safeguards against tyranny, such safeguards would only hold true in his ideal polity where people are ruled by reason and hence the general will within a community truly represents what people want and laws as determined by majority decision are accurately representations of the general will. </s>

<p n="p60.65">
<s n="s1.3;p60.65">In effect, it is a theory detached from reality. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p60.65">It becomes evident that there are too many conditions to be fulfilled in order to achieve this ideal solution. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p60.65">Its implausibility arises from his method of laying down one contract containing one set of terms that was applicable to any and all societies and his reliance on arguments not based on historical premise and quantifiable research that leads to its fallacy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p61.65">
<s n="s1.1;p61.65">As such if we take the worth of any political theory to be weighed in relative terms such as its theoretical credibility and relevance to practical politics, it is safe to assert that Rousseau presents a solution to the fundamental problem but not the best nor most practical solution. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion </head>
<p n="p62.65">
<s n="s1.2;p62.65">Even with its limitations and drawbacks as a practical solution, it will be unfair for us to impose our expectations of the theory before understanding his intentions. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p62.65">What Rousseau intended was to formulate an ideal civil society to which we should aware of and we should all aspire towards. </s>
</p>
<p n="p63.65">
<s n="s1.3;p63.65">He brings us through what is needed if individuals are to be liberated from the will of others and addresses faults in political culture and institutions that are plainly still with us in contrast to the idealistic social contract model he offers. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p63.65">By this manner, the strength of his theory lies in raising awareness of what is lacking and inadequate in civil society, for once we have identified the conditions of legitimate authority; we can see how impossible it would be to create it, so we are saddled with the inferior and illegitimate sort of societies which actually prevail. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p63.65">By deliberating resorting to such a paradox, he is not concerned to deny the received opinion which the paradox appears to challenge but to alert the reader of something which he might otherwise overlook. </s>
</p>
<p n="p64.65">
<s n="s1.3;p64.65">His fundamental focus is to provide a theoretical justification for the republic and not to the practical question of how it can be brought into existence. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p64.65">This is a doctrine whose only claim is to provide a solution to hypothetical problems and which does not pretend to offer a historical reconstruction of the way in which political societies evolved. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p64.65">Rousseau's purpose is to deal with the justification of society, not its origins. </s>
</p>
<p n="p65.65">
<s n="s1.1;p65.65">Henceforth, if we examined the fundamental problem and his accompanying solution to it with his intentions in mind, it is a noble attempt to fuse individual consent with the most distinctive and profound elements of contract theory, with his perfect unified ancient models built upon a foundational idea of the morality of the common good to bridge the connection between individual and state, such that each gains a fuller meaning. </s>
