<s n="s1.8;p1.24">Ibsen's <hi rend="italic">Hedda Gabler</hi> and Lorca's <hi rend="italic">Yerma</hi> display two female protagonists who are seen to exercise masculine behaviour throughout their tragedies. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.24">Hedda's inactivity and dependence on marriage for financial support is typical of a woman in late 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, Norwegian society. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.24">However, as a woman, Hedda is expected to find her <hi rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> in being a wife and a mother, but these designs do not at all content her. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.24">By rejecting the traditional practices of her gender, she becomes more masculine, which is displayed in her treatment of George Tesman and the power she attains over Eilert Løvborg. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.24">Unlike Hedda, Yerma desperately longs to use her ability to reproduce and, in conjunction with society, thinks it's degrading and wasteful to remain barren. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.24">As much as she yearns for motherhood, her husband is not at all compelled to have children, discarding Yerma's basic freedoms as a woman. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.24">In some ways, Yerma will never have the responsibilities of a man, the strength, or dominance in Spanish society. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.24">However, by neglecting the unique, reproductive capabilities of her womanhood, she is no longer defined by her gender and her lifestyle becomes closer to that of a man. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.24">
<s n="s1.2;p2.24">Camilla Collett was one of the first writers to highlight the feminist problem in Norway. </s>

</p>
<quote lang="English">My life passes uselessly without importance, suffocated by the eternal question whether this is really the kind of existence to which I am destined. It awakens me suddenly at night, I arise with it in the morning, and when I put on my nightcap in the evening and contemplate what I have done the whole day since I took it off, I am saddened and ask myself why I dress at all.<ref target="BAWE_6998e-ftnote.001"/>

<s n="s1.7;p3.24">There is little doubt that Hedda is similarly dissatisfied with her inactive, married life. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p3.24">Along with women of her time, Hedda did not exercise many freedoms in choosing a suitable husband. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.24">In conversation with Brack, she confesses that she married Tesman because he was determined he would be able to support her, none of her admirers made a similar offer and, above all, her 'time was up'<ref target="BAWE_6998e-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.24">Hedda's decision was accelerated by her increasing age as she depended on her beauty to attract men and, with little else to support her, she was required to consider the financial stability of her partner. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.24">These factors led Hedda to an ill-matched marriage with a man who, regardless of love and affection, she treats with an air of indifference. </s>

<p n="p4.24">
<s n="s1.11;p4.24">Unfulfilled by her husband and with no talent for motherhood, Hedda is compelled to create her own amusement to relieve herself from boredom. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.24">She considers that Tesman could inject some excitement into her life if she could persuade him into an occupation that interests her, such as politics, as she is not at liberty to pursue this career herself. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.24">In the opening scene of this play, she offends Miss Tesman by identifying her new hat as that belonging to the maid and later confesses to Brack that she consciously upset her for her own entertainment. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.24">While this mischievous behaviour is not exceptionally harmful, her objective to control the life of another can hardly be described in the same terms. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.24">Ibsen is keen to excuse her conduct as a consequence of her gender in patriarchal society. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.24">He argues that 'women have no influence on external matters of government. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.24">Therefore they want to have an influence on souls'<ref target="BAWE_6998e-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.24">Ibsen successfully highlights this as a desire among women by extending similar behaviour to Mrs Elvsted. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.24">The introduction of her character encourages the audience to compare her with Hedda, as they are both married women of a similar age. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.24">It is certain that Elvsted is proud to have influenced Løvborg in the way Ibsen describes, but to influence a person is quite different from a desire to govern lives. </s>

<p n="p5.24">
<s n="s1.3;p5.24">While Hedda actively seeks control of Løvborg with the intention to destroy him, Elvsted's power is not something she sought, planned or understands. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.24">Hedda scornfully perceives that she 'saved' Løvborg, but her positive influence is completely undone by Hedda, who consciously moves him to destruction. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.24">Although Ibsen delegates a similar aspiration to these women, it is considerably more dangerous in the hands of the malicious, treacherous protagonist who applies greater pressure to Løvborg and achieves extreme results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.24">
<s n="s1.9;p6.24">In comparing these women, it becomes clear that Elvsted does not experience inertia like Hedda in this play. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p6.24">She escapes her unhappy marriage because she cannot bear to simply be a convenience to an old man who 'cares for no one but himself' (25). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p6.24">Despite the criticisms of society and monetary concerns, she pursues a better life with Løvborg, who respects her and, through education, has elevated her to a level of equality with him. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p6.24">She seeks her 'comrade in arms' because she enjoys his company and he provides her with a focus by allowing her to assist him in writing his revolutionary works. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p6.24">J. Chesley Taylor observes that 'Hedda is a character who is torn between two selves: the romantic self, which desires to be liberated from all social restrictions, and the conformist self, which wants society's approval and thus dares not violate its taboos'<ref target="BAWE_6998e-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p6.24">This causes Elvsted and Hedda to react opposingly to identical situations. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p6.24">Hedda is similarly unhappy in her married life with Tesman but, while she admires Elvsted for taking a brave leap, she would never repeat her actions because she lacks courage to challenge society's conventions. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p6.24">She used to enjoy Løvborg's company, like Elvsted, but she left him out of cowardice when their friendship began to develop. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p6.24">Therefore, while Ibsen realises that the contained lives of women can lead them to a useless, mundane existence, he displays hope in Elvsted who is an active figure because, unlike Hedda, she does not fear scandal for the sake of her happiness and a motivational object in life. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p9.24">She delights in the authority that her pistols attach to her, but provokes entirely different reactions from her victims, Tesman and Brack. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.24">While Brack controls her actions with calm, authoritative imperatives such as, 'Don't point that thing at me' and 'Don't play the fool' (37), Tesman cannot trust her not to operate the pistols. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.24">He panics, expresses sheer terror and begs her to put them away, highlighting her manly control over him. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.24">By showing both reactions, Ibsen implies that Hedda's relationship with Tesman allows her to become more masculine because, as perceived by Theoharis, his 'gender is neuter' (Theoharis, "Hedda Gabler and "The Dead", p. 797). </s>

<s n="s3.4;p20.24">At the beginning of the play, she is seen sombrely agreeing to Juan's request to stay indoors but her days of yielding come to an end when she begins to dominate in arguments with Juan by confusing him with sophisticated metaphors and firmly expressing her criticisms. </s>
