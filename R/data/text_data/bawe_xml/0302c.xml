<s n="s2.3;p1.10">Forming the basis of the American Declaration of Independence which claims that all governments "derive[e] their just powers from the consent of the governed" as well as changing the scholar's understanding of the entire chapter of Locke's constructed state, the four paragraphs defining and addressing the status of tacit and express consent have become the justification for political authority. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p9.10">Locke also fails to reconcile the inconsistencies associated with property. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p9.10">Locke's theory of consent is intrinsically bound up with the idea of possessions, claiming equally that people consent to government rule for the protection of said property, and that children accept the rules their father consented to when they "come of age" (aged 21) and inherit land ("property"). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p9.10">This method, however, forces consent on the second generation of a family. </s>

<s n="s5.10;p9.10">Though it is argued that, if inheritance laws of the 17 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century are studied this flaw is reconciled, Locke fails to state a solution himself. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p9.10">Furthermore, Locke ignores those that do not own property. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p9.10">This is because he never intended or expected that those without property would be in charge of civil society. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p9.10">In order for the system to be advantageous to those with property, whom Locke gives priority to, those without it must be excluded from its privileges although still protected by and subject to its laws. </s>
