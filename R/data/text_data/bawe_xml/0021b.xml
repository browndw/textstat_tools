<p n="p4.36">
<s n="s1.3;p4.36">The structure of the light rail industry is such that each localised firm has a monopoly for light rail travel. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p11.36">This situation arises because <hi rend="italic">Centro</hi> has authority granted to it by government and therefore normal monopoly conduct (such as price fixing and promotional activity) is controlled since the government aims to create a service for all rather than a purely profiteering enterprise. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p32.36">These do not apply since a new firm would not need to construct a new line and would not need to gain local or central government backing or financial support. </s>

<head>Five Recommendations</head>
<p n="p34.36">
<s n="s1.1;p34.36">Investment required for a new light rail system would be a high risk venture and, in contrast to some high risk business opportunities, there does not appear to be a lucrative reward for those who succeed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.36">
<s n="s1.3;p35.36">The acquisition of Midland Metro would not be as risky a business manoeuvre for reasons detailed in the previous section. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p35.36">My recommendation is that, if you are to either set up a new business in competition with the Midland Metro or attempt an acquisition of that company, then an acquisition would be the best strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p35.36">Irrespective of the decision to purchase Midland Metro or establish a competitor, a cost leadership strategy would be most appropriate. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.36">
<s n="s1.3;p36.36">It is possible that given the rising concerns about the impact our way of life is having on the environment that government may increase its efforts to persuade people to use public/ environmentally friendly modes of transport. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p36.36">If such a campaign were to be successful then light rail and other public transport could become a much more attractive industry. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p36.36">It may be worth waiting for a more favourable climate (in terms of personal transport) before attempting to enter this industry. </s>
