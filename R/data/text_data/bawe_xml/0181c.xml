<s n="s1.4;p1.18">Ever played join the dots, only to find the lines spelled out a word? </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.18">Don Eigler, a researcher for IBM, took that to extremes in 1989 when he spelled out the word IBM using only 35 Xenon atoms. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.18">The letters were about 5nm high, or 1/10,000 the width of a human hair. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.18">Each dot in the image shown is a single Xenon atom, placed there using the power of scanning tunnelling microscopy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.18">
<s n="s1.2;p2.18">The technology is not limited to miniature advertising, however. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.18">Scanning tunnelling microscopy opens a gateway to the nano-scale world, it is invaluable for research into surface physics, and it will play a part in forming the next generation of nanotechnology. </s>

<p n="p3.18">
<s n="s1.5;p3.18">What is scanning tunnelling microscopy? </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.18">Often shortened to STM, it is a technique used to extrapolate images of a surface on an atomic scale. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.18">Invented by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in 1981, and earning them a Nobel Prize in 1986, it relies on the quantum mechanical principle of "tunnelling" to operate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.18">STM allows researchers to compute the relative heights of a sample surface - in effect, the locations of atoms resting on top of a reference surface. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.18">It is also used to ionise or manipulate individual atoms, as seen in the IBM picture above. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.18">
<s n="s1.6;p4.18">Prior to the invention of STM, surface analysis was carried out using two main methods, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.18">Both of these relied on the small wavelengths of the particles involved to produce diffraction patterns when scattered from a material. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.18">These patterns were then analysed, and from the results, an idea of the composition of the material could be formed. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.18">Unfortunately, for composite molecules, the patterns became increasingly complex, such that researchers could not agree on an interpretation of the data. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.18">The advantage STM holds over these predecessors is the ability to produce a real space representation of the scanned surface, even for molecules with complicated structures. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.18">This removes the problem of interpreting diffraction patterns to deduce a surface structure, replacing it with the simpler task of reading an electron density diagram. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.18">
<s n="s1.5;p5.18">The STM apparatus consists of a sharpened probe (ideally with the tip being a single atom) mounted about a nanometre above a conductive sample. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.18">A voltage is applied between probe and sample, causing electrons to "tunnel" or flow from the sample to the tip (or from tip to sample, depending on the polarity). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.18">This flow produces a current, which is exponentially related to the separation between the sample and the tip. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.18">As the STM tip is moved across the surface, the current changes in line with the sample height. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.18">Two methods exist to analyse this change. </s>

<p n="p6.18">
<s n="s1.3;p6.18">The most commonly used technique is known as constant current scanning. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.18">The tip is mounted on a piezoelectric element, through which the current can be kept constant by adjusting the height of the tip through use of a feedback loop. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.18">From the raising and lowering of the STM tip, a physical map of the surface can be inferred. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.18">
<s n="s1.3;p7.18">Alternatively, the height can be kept constant, and the current variations can be measured. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.18">This method gives data on the electron density of the surface, and can be used to deduce information about the electronic configurations of the material. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.18">Constant height scanning is only practical for very flat surfaces, however, as on rougher samples the tip can impact on the higher regions of the surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.18">
<s n="s1.5;p8.18">The applications of STM are potentially diverse. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.18">In the research world, STM currently holds the title for the highest resolution of electron density data available at such a small scale. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.18">We interviewed Dr. <name type="other"/> of <name type="university"/> University, who uses STM in his research on 3-5 semiconductors (compounds of group 3 and group 5 elements). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.18">As it is highly dependent on electron density, he explains, the technique is better suited to semiconductor research, rather than scanning of metals where the electrons are less localised. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.18">Increased atom separation in the semiconductors also gives them the advantage over metals for high resolution scanning. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.18">
<s n="s1.5;p9.18">STM is by no means an easy tool to use, however. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.18">Generally, the process is highly sensitive to contamination, as a single atom deposited on the surface will produce a significant change in the topography. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.18">To that end, most STM procedures are carried out in ultra-high vacuum. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.18">This alone complicates the procedure, requiring special airtight chambers (see right) in which to carry out the scan, and a thorough cleaning of the sample before it can be analysed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.18">McConville gives as an example the STM in <name type="university"/>, which operates under pressure of approximately 10 <hi rend="sup">-10</hi> millibars. </s>

<p n="p10.18">
<s n="s1.6;p10.18">In addition to this, to ensure accurate readings, both the sample and the STM apparatus must be protected from vibrations of the same order of magnitude as the measurements being taken. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.18">Given the nano-scale on which the process works, this is no simple task! </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.18">Even slight vibrations of the chamber can negate the validity of the scan. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.18">The way to prevent this, according to McConville, is through the use of a two stage dampening process. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.18">Initially, the test chamber is mounted on springs, in as stable an environment as possible, to reduce the impact of environmental vibrations. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.18">Whilst this would suffice for a typical experiment, STM takes it one step further, with the introduction of magnetic dampening. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.18">
<s n="s1.4;p11.18">Around most STMs, he explains, a series of permanent magnets and copper fins is arranged, such that any movement of the chamber disturbs the system. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.18">The movement of the fins, relative to the magnets, sets up "eddy currents" which then damp the vibrations. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.18">In effect, a vibration acts to reduce itself. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.18">This method, although not perfect, is sufficient to produce atomic resolutions; in other words, with a well-damped STM setup you can interpret, to a good degree of accuracy, the location of an atom on a surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.18">
<s n="s1.8;p12.18">STM has also been combined with other technologies to provide a more in-depth analysis of molecular structures. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p12.18">In order to analyse quantum dots, Tsukamoto Labs, in the University of Tokyo, have successfully constructed an STMBE device, combining the STM technique with the MBE technology. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p12.18">Molecular beam epitaxy is a method of creating perfect crystals from pure materials, one layer of atoms at a time. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p12.18">The problem with analysing these crystals is the difficulty in transporting them from the MBE growth chamber to the STM apparatus. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p12.18">To maintain the purity of the crystals, they must be kept in ultrahigh vacuum throughout the transfer. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p12.18">Whilst possible, the procedure is complex, and allows the crystals to warm up or cool down. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p12.18">In the STMBE, the STM is contained within the MBE growth chamber, allowing analysis without moving the crystal, and at consistent temperature. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p12.18">Furthermore, it is possible to scan before, after, and even during the crystal growth, and thus visualise the crystal forming. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.18">
<s n="s1.6;p13.18">That said, watching crystals is not the only use for STM, as shown by Eigler's image. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.18">If, instead of measuring the tunnelling current, you pulse a small current through the tip, whilst keeping the sample at very low (about 4K) temperatures, you can excite the atom sufficiently to leave the surface. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.18">The atom then attaches itself to the STM tip, and can be placed elsewhere on the sample simply by moving the tip there and reversing the potential of the current. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.18">This technique, as McConville describes, has more applications than creating record-breaking logos. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.18">Eigler went on to position a set of iron atoms in various shapes, including a circle, triangle, and square. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.18">Inside these, he found and scanned electron waves reflecting off the other atoms, and even interfering with each other, as in the picture. </s>

<p n="p14.18">
<s n="s1.7;p14.18">The ability to position atoms with such precision is not only of interest to researchers, however. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.18">Precise atom placement has tremendous ramifications in the field of technological advancement. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.18">Without STM, manipulation of matter at the nano-scale would be next to impossible. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.18">Nanotechnology is heavily reliant on STM and its associated techniques to further its own work. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.18">As a scanning technique, STM allows nanotech researchers to visualise the effects of their work. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.18">As a tool, STM invests researchers with the ability to build on a nano-scale. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.18">Already, Eigler has made simple sets of logic gates, the basis of computing, from iron atoms manipulated with STM. In the future, research into self-replicating nano-bots will require the power of STM to construct initial prototypes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.18">
<s n="s1.3;p15.18">Nanotech is not the only beneficiary of STM research. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.18">McConville's own STM research includes analysis of spintronic materials, where you can control not only the charge of an atom, but also the electron spin. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.18">This is currently of great interest to computer technology developers, who see it as the next step in data storage technology. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.18">
<s n="s1.4;p16.18">With the recent popularity explosion of computing, and the potential benefits to computing that nanotechnology promises, it is easy to see why the field is a hot research topic. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.18">As a cornerstone of nanotech research, STM is a valuable and useful tool in the development of next generation technology. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.18">As a technique, STM is also essential to improving our understanding of the world beyond the microscopic, and furthering of the nanosciences. </s>
