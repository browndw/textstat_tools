<s n="s1.8;p1.17">'Madness' is a difficult concept to define or explain. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.17">One definition offered by Phillips is that "Madness is divisive and undermining", and "when we imagine the so-called mad they appear before us in lurid or horrifying or fascinating or discomforting images." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.8;p1.17">Amongst modern psychoanalysts, it has been suggested that "we are born with varying amounts of sanity and madness inside us".<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.002"/> Indeed, some of Melanie Klein's followers are "adverse to madness, though resigned to the inevitability of our unending struggle with it because, like sin, it is assumed to be integral to our nature." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s4.8;p1.17">Many of the elements we associate with madness are instinctual and irrational, those which many psychoanalysts believe to be concentrated within the unconscious, or 'Id'. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.17">The conscious self, or 'ego', on the other hand "cannot exist in the individual from the start; the ego has to be developed".<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.004"/> The development of the ego cannot avoid cultural or social influences; in fact it could be argued that it is because of these influences that there is a need for it to develop. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.17">What madness reveals then is perhaps a created "second self, a stranger within, a place where all that cannot for one reason or another be expressed or realized in civil life takes up residence." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.005"/>
<s n="s7.8;p1.17">The suggestion that "Madness lies in subjugation by the state," and also "in the way the state makes us subjects" can be supported by a number of literary texts and theories. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.17">However, as this essay will argue, it also lies in how we construct ourselves within society "by the intricate complex of subject and object relations that constitutes our symbolic realities."<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s6.8;p3.17">During this period it seemed to many that "the modern concept of madness was a cultural invention of control" (Foucault) and that doctors were used "as a way of keeping dangerous people at bay" (R.D. Laing).<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.013"/> The character of McMurphy is considered on the surface to be a threat to society, held in custody for statutory rape of an underage girl. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.17">However, the threat he represents is far more complex. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p3.17">If relating the characters of the novel to Freud's model of the ego, one might compare McMurphy to the Id; to the primary, irrational energies of the mind which Freud characterised as "a combination of sexual libido and other instincts, such as aggression".<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.014"/> His freedom of spirit and strength as an individual is a threat against a repressive state and society, and he is consequently locked away and labelled insane. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p4.17">Having worked in a mental hospital, Kesey, too, had become suspicious of the "boundaries that had been created between sane and insane." </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s3.8;p4.17">Indeed, the pivotal paradox of <hi rend="italic">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</hi> is that of trying to escape the inescapable. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.017"/>
<s n="s2.9;p5.17">It could be argued that Bromden adopts a muted persona as a mechanism "for redirecting libido into safer channels, including repression, projection and introjection [...] rationalism and sublimation." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.018"/>
<s n="s3.9;p5.17">The extent to which Bromden can be considered 'mad' is indeed questionable. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.17">Many have regarded him to be schizophrenic; however, it might be more accurate to suggest that his madness is driven by state subjugation. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.17">His paranoid suspicion of the 'Combine' could in fact be interpreted as an accurate perception of "a collaboration of governmental and industrial groups he believes are trying to control people by way of machines" <ref target="BAWE_3006l-ftnote.019"/>; this is, of course, what is happening within in the hospital. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.17">However, neither the Chief, nor even Harding, blame this national Combine, or in fact anything, for rendering "some people mad and incapacitated" whilst others seem "to transcend their own limitations and the obstacles thrown in their way." </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.17">It is not only McMurphy who is caught in a paradox; the "fundamental opposition" in the novel, as suggested by a number of critics, is "not between madness and sanity but between being trapped and free." </s>

<s n="s8.9;p5.17">It becomes possible here to question whether the presentation of individuals in <hi rend="italic">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</hi> suggests that madness lies wholly in subjugation by the state. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.17">Perhaps it would be more sufficient to say that, in the case of Chief Bromden, the latter part of the statement is more accurate, but also that his 'madness' stems from his own inability to construct himself within the present symbolic order. </s>
