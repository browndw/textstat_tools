<s n="s2.2;p1.45">Many thinkers and empirical social scientists have devoted their time in assessing capital punishment in its totality however it is clearly out of a question to even attempt a comprehensive treatment of it on that extensive scale here. </s>

<p n="p2.45">
<s n="s1.6;p2.45">Instead, the essay will present a coherent and convincing argument for capital punishment to be reinstated in abolitionist states and maintained in retentionist states in four parts. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.45">The first part of the essay will evaluate capital punishment on its own terms and justify it from a combination of three theoretical perspectives in the order of the retributivist approach, the deterrence aspect and finally the reformist or moral education school of thought. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.45">Following on, the next section will examine two practical features of the capital punishment - its fallibility and its finality - which, firmly justify the need to retain the death penalty, contrary to belief that both are arguments for its abolition. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.45">The next part of the essay will evaluate capital punishment in its respective societal context and judicial/criminal system. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.45">This holistic approach will advocate some safeguards and limitations to "perfect" capital punishment in an imperfect world. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.45">Lastly, the essay will conclude that capital punishment is not only justified in its own right and in the justified circumstances, the state is the only justified authority with the means to implement it. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p8.45">It does not mean that we literally apply the golden rule of "an eye for an eye" on matching punishments with crimes by raping rapists; it just means that the society's worst punishment is associated with the society's worst penalty within a hierarchy of morally permissible punishments in the state.<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.010"/> Hence the death penalty should be kept as a viable option for states to adopt for the worst crimes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.45">The Archbishop of Canterbury also reiterated this view when he stated that by reserving the death penalty for murder, the criminal law stigmatizes the gravest crime by the gravest punishment; hence it helps to "to foster in the community a special abhorrence of murder as 'crime of crimes' so that the element of retribution merges into that of deterrence".<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.011"/> </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.45">
<s n="s1.6;p12.45">In any analysis of punishment, the question of deterrence is paramount; it seems inevitable that public policy will be derived from the assessment of capital punishment's deterrent effect. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.45">Utilitarian theorists would measure the worth of punishment based on the consequential effects it brings about. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.45">In this sense, the justification for capital punishment is most convincingly put forth by its short term deterrent effect. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.45">Based on the common sense knowledge of human nature and the efficacy of the punishment understood in terms of its capacity to produce fear or avoidance reactions, it is believed that capital punishment "brings about consequential goods that outweigh the harms it causes".<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.014"/> Put simply, the death penalty because of its severity &amp; finality is more feared than imprisonment and deters some prospective murderers not deterred by the threat of imprisonment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.45">After all, no one goes to certain inevitable death except by force. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.45">Put the matter in another perspective; "was there ever yet a criminal who, when sentenced to death and brought out to die, would refuse the offer of a commutation of his sentence for the severest secondary punishment"?<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.015"/> </s>

<s n="s1.2;p13.45">Although many abolitionists argue against the capital punishment based on the lack of a statistical proof for its deterrent value, yet "statistics will only show that there is no statistical proof for the deterrent effect of the death penalty but they do not show that there is no deterrent effect".<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.016"/> The inconspicuousness of the deterrent effect also leads to its justification as J S Mill; a classic utilitarian stated evidently that "we partly know who those are whom it has not deterred, but who is there who knows whom it has deterred or how many human beings it has saved who would lived to be murderers if that awful association had not been thrown round the idea of murder from their earliest infancy".<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.017"/> It seems clear that many would like to think that capital punishment does not deter as it relieves us of the weight of a moral decision to impose it on others. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p43.45">Even in a practical world, it is arguable that the benefits of implementing a capital punishment system outweigh the costs. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p43.45">As it has been reiterated before, the capital punishment system can be justified on its own merits via the combination of three approaches: retributivist, deterrence and reformist. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p43.45">Furthermore, it has been justified that there is no other alternative punishment that can match up to the appropriateness, efficiency and effectiveness of a capital punishment system in relation to grave capital crimes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.45">What is needed is the realization that different principles or justifications may be relevant at different points in imposing the death penalty in different cases. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.45">
<s n="s1.5;p44.45">Beyond the belief that capital punishment has merit in itself, the capital punishment system must also be justified by other practical variables within the state it is implemented in. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p44.45">Simply put, the death penalty could be more justified in some cases and in some countries more so than others. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p44.45">It is a circumstantial concept of which we should assess it not merely on "its internal workings but on the wider socio-political context in which it is set".<ref target="BAWE_0137l-ftnote.053"/> Hence it is crucial that abolitionists' countries adopt a soft approach to a hard penal treatment and be less judgmental on their abolitionist stance. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p44.45">Instead there should be a higher tolerance and understanding of countries that have retained the death penalty driven by practical necessity and out of pure belief in the value of the system. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p44.45">On this note, the death penalty is further justified in practice when it is imposed by a legitimate state which applies the penalty justly and selectively against the worst crimes fully secured in a just judicial system with the rights to appeal. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p45.45">To conclude, the capital punishment system is justified theoretically to a great extent on its own merit. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p45.45">While we do not always assume that the actualities will be close to that ideal, the capital punishment system is justified practically like any other fallible penalty system that is capable of reform to near perfection. </s>
