<head rend="underlined">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p28.32">
<s n="s1.6;p28.32">The grass plant is extremely efficient in taking up N from the soil, provided that there is sufficient moisture, and the temperature is suited for growth (Brockman). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p28.32">It is due to the inefficiency of the animal at grass that causes a poor distribution of N, and makes the N most at risk of being lost. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p28.32">Grassland soils typically have high contents of organic matter, resulting in a substantial supply of N by mineralization. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p28.32">(Brockman). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p28.32">However, it must be noted that an input of nitrogen in excess of the plants requirement is likely to be leached. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p28.32">Due to this, it may be suggested that reducing the nitrogen input to the soil to a level slightly below the level needed to give the optimum yield, will ensure that there is less loss to the soil. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.32">
<s n="s1.1;p29.32">Rainfall, over application of nitrogen and livestock are the key contributors to leaching from grassland, but careful management can reduce the effect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.32">
<s n="s1.2;p30.32">It must be realised that downward leaching is not the only method by which nitrates are lost from the soil. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.32">Nitrates are also lost: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Upwards, crop uptake and gaseous loss.</item>
<item>Sideward, via surface/subsurface flow.</item>
<item>Ammonia volatization.</item>
<item>Denitrification.</item>
</list>
<p n="p31.32">
<s n="s1.1;p31.32">Intensively grazed grassland is at the highest risk of losing nitrate, having the highest input of nitrogen, and generally in being in areas of England with a higher rainfall. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.32">
<s n="s1.4;p32.32">Fertilisers (organic/inorganic) should only be applied to the grass when it can make best use of the nitrates. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p32.32">In a grassland system this would mean not applying any between 15 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> September and 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> February. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p32.32">From the mid season onwards, the amount of fertiliser applied should be reduced, as the grass will not grow as much. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p32.32">Application of a fertiliser should only be done if the growth of the grass will actually be used fully. </s>
