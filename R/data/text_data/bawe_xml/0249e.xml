<head rend="bold">Summary</head>
<p>This report investigates the frictional forces inherent in laminar and turbulent pipe flow. The apparatus used pumped oil in a laminar flow through a pipe of uniform cross section and radius. At measured intervals the pressure could be derived as a U bend was calibrated using a mercury reservoir. The height of the mercury in each column was relative to the pressures in the pipe at that point. The mass flow rate through the pipe was measured using scales that measured the weight of the tank as the oil filled it. The subsequent fall in pressure along the length of the pipe, and the flow rate through it were used to obtain an estimate for the Reynolds number, and coefficient of friction through the pipe. The coefficient of friction was then compared against established results once plotted on the Moody chart. The experiment was repeated, but with turbulent flow through the pipe. Placing a pin across the width of the pipe, interrupting the laminar flow and introducing turbulence within it achieved this. For turbulent flow, the Reynolds number was found to be slightly lower than that of laminar, whilst the friction factor was nearly doubled. This shows that there is a greater resistance to flow, and a greater skin friction inherent within a turbulent pipe flow than laminar flow.</p>
