<quote lang="English">"O perish all the gold and every emerald in the world sooner than any girl weep as we march away! It is right that you, Messalla, campaign by land and sea to adorn your town-house with the spoils of war. But I am held a pris'ner, fettered by a lovely girl, and take my post as keeper by her cruel door. Glory has no charms for me, my Delia. They can call me Slack and ineffective, if only I'm with you. O let me gaze at you, when my last hour comes - Hold you, as I die, in my failing grasp! Delia, you will weep for me on a bed of burning And you will give me kisses mixed with bitter tears. Yes, you will weep; your heart is not encased in iron Nor is there flint in your tender breast. There will be no young man and no unmarried girl Going home dry-eyed from my funeral. But do no violence, Delia, to my departed spirit: Spare your flowing tresses and spare your tender cheeks. Meanwhile, with Fate's permission, let us unite and love. Tomorrow Death will come, head hooded - in the dark, Or useless Age creep up, and it will not be seemly To make white-headed love or pretty speeches. Light Venus is our duty now, while there is no disgrace In breaking down a door, while brawling brings delight. Here I can lead and soldier well. Eagles and trumpets, dismiss! Bring wounds to greedy husbands, and bring them money too. But let me live at peace myself, with produce heaped in store, Looking down on hunger as I look down on the rich."
