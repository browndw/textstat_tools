<p n="p2.28">
<s n="s1.2;p2.28">The phenomenon of terrorism appeared centuries ago in the form of state terrorism (the regime of Terror established under the Convention by Robespierre during the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century French Revolution; the terrorist policy of the Proletarian state) but it developed against the state during the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.28">Let's consider the synthetic definition Gilbert Guillaume gives of it: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Terrorism is a method of combat in which the victims are not chosen on an individual basis but at random or for symbolic effect. The goal pursued in attacking them is not to eliminate the victims themselves but to spread terror among the group to which they belong. By doing so, terrorists generally seek to compel governments or public opinion to make some concession towards them'<ref target="BAWE_0409a-ftnote.001"/>.</quote>

<p n="p3.28">
<s n="s1.2;p3.28">This definition is currently accepted and has been used by the international community to depict the acts of violence which occurred on 9/11/01 in New York, 12/10/02 in Bali, 11/03/04 in Madrid, 7/7/05 in London, and 11/07/06 in Bombay. </s>

<p n="p4.28">
<s n="s1.1;p4.28">These events enact the recent development of non-state transnational armed actors and challenge the traditional legal apprehension of warfare and armed conflicts. </s>

<p n="p5.28">
<s n="s1.6;p5.28">A new type of war has emerged: the asymmetric war opposes a state and a group of private actors. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.28">The legal status of the actors of terrorism as an asymmetric war is the focus of this report. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.28">Do the actors of an asymmetric conflict observe the limitations on the means and methods of warfare set by the law of war? </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.28">If not, are they entitled to the protection of IHL rules? </s>

<s n="s6.6;p5.28">What are their rights and responsibilities? </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.28">
<s n="s1.3;p6.28">As IHL is done by and for the states, the question of the legitimacy, if any, of the use of force by non-state actors is highly controversial. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.28">Indeed, what are the consequences of the lack of protection and responsibility of transnational non-state groups involved in an armed conflict with a state? </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.28">How might an increase of this protection change the outcome of the war? </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.28">
<s n="s1.1;p7.28">Since only states can be parties in the Geneva Conventions, IHL does not apply to conflicts between a state and a terrorist group. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.28">
<s n="s1.2;p8.28">The necessity of a legal and general definition must be based on the reduction of the concept of terrorism to necessary and sufficient conditions and variables. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.28">But then, one might wonder what the use and the implications of such a definition are when it clearly appears that a consensus is internationally reached upon the qualification of the events from New York to Bombay as terrorist acts. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="italic">Political consensus and silence of the legal texts</head>
<p n="p10.28">
<s n="s1.6;p10.28">Despite the numerous legal instruments prohibiting acts of terrorism (The Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, 1970; New York Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, 1973; International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, New York, 1979; Rome Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988), the term 'terrorism' has never been used or defined in any of them. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.28">Indeed, it was difficult to find a unanimously accepted definition of terrorism because of the opposition of the members of the Group of 77 which did not want to confuse terrorism and national liberation movements in a period of decolonization. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.28">This debate highlights the ambiguity and ambivalence of the notion of terrorism whose definition is necessarily biased. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.28">It is striking that neither the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism of 1977, nor the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings of 1997 mentioned any definition of terrorism. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.28">The International Convention for the suppression of the Financing of Terrorism of 1999 (the most achieved text on the issue) mentions the term 'terrorism' ten times without defining it. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.28">In the Resolution 1368 of 12 September 2001, the Security Council did not specify what the term 'terrorism' meant<ref target="BAWE_0409a-ftnote.002"/>. </s>

</note>
<p n="p11.28">
<s n="s1.6;p11.28">It seems that this absence of definition is rather a way for states to use and legitimate ways to struggle against terrorism than a deficiency. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.28">Indeed, terrorism is precisely an asymmetric threat where the target is easily identifiable (the state, its population and civil infrastructures) whereas the perpetrators and their weapons can take every possible form. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.28">A definition is a way to name something but also a way to enclose, delimitate a phenomenon to its definition and exclude exterior aspects. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.28">If a definition of terrorism had been accepted unanimously, the danger would be that, renewing itself constantly, it would escape from its definition and leave the states without any legal means of riposte. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.28">There is no limit to the scope of action against terrorism as long as terrorism is not defined. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p12.28">To which legal category does the terrorist correspond? </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.28">The category of 'terrorists' can be defined negatively according to two sets of conditions that they do not meet. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.28">It is important to note that each category applied to the terrorist act falls automatically into the imprecision. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p13.28">It is a common opinion that terrorists aim at attacking civilians and civil targets. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p13.28">This is a first breach in one of the cardinal principles of IHL: the distinction of civilians and combatants and the protection of the first. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.28">Indeed, the First Additional Protocol of the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949, referring to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, 08 June 1977, in its article 51-2, prohibits the acts of terrorism against civilians: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">'Acts of threat of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited'</quote>
<p n="p14.28">
<s n="s1.2;p14.28">If the function of this categorization is to accuse terrorists of war crimes, then the unlawful attack of military persons and objects should be qualified of act of terrorism. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.28">Indeed, both civilians and combatants are protected by IHL. This criterion seems then not to help at circumscribing the concept of terrorism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.28">
<s n="s1.2;p15.28">Second, the terrorist does not fit into the definition of a combatant (member of armed forces inside an armed conflict). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.28">Armed forces are defined by Article 43 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Convention IV as </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English"> 'organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that Party for the conduct or its subordinates (...). Such armed forces shall be subject to an international disciplinary system which, inter alia, shall enforce compliance with the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict'.</quote>
<p n="p16.28">
<s n="s1.2;p16.28">Criteria defining armed conflicts depend on the intensity, the number of active participants, the number of victims, the duration and the prolonged character of the violence, the organization and the discipline of the parties, the capability to respect IHL, the collective, open and coordinated character of the hostilities, and the direct involvement of governmental armed forces<ref target="BAWE_0409a-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p17.28">If an armed attack does not meet all the criteria, then it is not an armed conflict and the persons who take part in it are not concerned by IHL. How then to qualify the attacks of 9/11 which inflicted massive destructions, the death of almost 3000 people, and which required sustained and intense funding and logistics. </s>

</p>
<p n="p19.28">
<s n="s1.9;p19.28">The difficulties encountered by the international community to reach a consensus about the definition of terrorism are due to the fact that 'one's terrorist is another's freedom fighter'. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p19.28">We cannot treat people who fight for freedom against an aggressor (the French Resistants under the Nazi occupation of France during WWII) in the same way as we should treat people who bombed two buildings with the intention of killing people and spreading terror in a society. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p19.28">Indeed, does a good cause justify the use of ultimate means of violence? </s>
<s n="s8.9;p19.28">The motive of action of terrorists is irrelevant to qualify it as a terrorist act. </s>

<p n="p26.28">
<s n="s1.8;p26.28">Terrorism is a concept at the centre of our political life. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p26.28">It is a phenomenon which shapes and informs the global politics of security, cooperation and relations between cultures. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p26.28">It is maybe not advisable that the complex reality of such a phenomenon should be reduced to a single word definition. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p26.28">It might be an error in the process of fighting, preventing and understanding such acts of violence, to wish to apply necessary and sufficient conditions and variables to this concept, and to delimitate it in an abstract category. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p26.28">In the same way, the most serious vigilance must be attached to the acts of the states engaged in the 'War on Terror'. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p26.28">The rule of law cannot be transgressed in the name of the necessity to fight a terrorist threat. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p26.28">The perpetrators of the most horrendous crimes still have human rights. </s>

<p n="p27.28">
<s n="s1.7;p27.28">The attempts to create a new legal category for terrorism and terrorists rather revealed the complexity of the notion than gave a definite answer to the question. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p27.28">The ambiguity and subjectivity of the concept of terrorism make it impossible to find one example without its counter-example<ref target="BAWE_0409a-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p27.28">Indeed all the criteria which qualify an act of terrorism do not apply all at the same time to each act of terrorism. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p27.28">This kind of concept does not fit in a legal perspective. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p27.28">I believe, with Fletcher, that a political intuition, respectful of the rule of law as well as International Human Rights Law, is more relevant than a legal definition. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p27.28">Moreover, situations like the detention of people in Guantanamo Bay are not likely to deter any potential terrorist from expressing his or her resentment through spectacular acts of violence. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p27.28">Politicians must be aware of the multi-faceted phenomenon of terrorism and develop policies aiming at reducing its causes and at prosecuting the perpetrators of acts of violence. </s>
