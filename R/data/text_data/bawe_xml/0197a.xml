<s n="s1.4;p60.71">Two examples are discussed in this section. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p60.71">First comes the devaluation of the pound in 1967: On the night of 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> November, 1967, the British government announced that it was lowering the exchange rate so the pound was worth 2.40$, down from 2.80$, a cut over 14%. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p60.71">This decision followed weeks of increasingly feverish speculation and a day in which the Bank of England spent £200m trying to shore up the pound from its gold and dollar reserves.<ref target="BAWE_0197a-ftnote.005"/> The Prime Minister at that time, Harold Wilson, indicated that the only alternative was to borrow heavily from foreign governments. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p60.71">However, the only loans on offer were short-term ones. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p61.71">The devaluation of British pound in 1967 is considered to be a classical evidence of first generation speculative attack model, as it almost showed all the elements in this model. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p61.71">First of all, the British government was running an £800m budget deficit at that time; second, speculators had correct foresight: they knew the pound was weak and they decided to attack it; third, there was not any other choice for government but only buying pounds with its reserves; finally, the government could not hold the pound any longer and the currency depreciated. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p62.71">Bretton Woods System was based on Bretton Woods Agreement, which was signed by 44 nations during the first three weeks of July in 1944. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p62.71">The U.S dollar was set to be in a core position in this system: it is the standard to which every other currency was pegged and it was the only currency directly convertible into gold for official purposes. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p62.71">The benchmark of gold price referred to the rate on 1 <hi rend="sup">st</hi> July, 1944, which is $35 per ounce. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p62.71">Therefore, as the Bretton Woods system evolved, the reserves of most countries became a combination of gold and dollars. </s>

<p n="p64.71">
<s n="s1.5;p64.71">In addition to this, the U.S currency market was facing two more problems. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p64.71">The first one was the combination of its reserves. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p64.71">At the beginning of 1958, US reserve assets included foreign currencies such as Yen, DM and British pound at first. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p64.71">However, by the end of the 1960s, the US international reserve consisted of mainly gold. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p64.71">Reserve is volatile if it mainly consists of a particular currency (it is gold in this case): when this kind of foreign currency suddenly depreciates, the real value of reserves will decrease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p65.71">
<s n="s1.8;p65.71">The second problem faced by the U.S government was the dramatic increase in liabilities to foreign central banks. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p65.71">According to Choi (1996), by 1963, the US gold reserve still roughly covered liabilities to foreign central banks; and by 1970 the gold coverage had fallen to 55%, by 1971 22%. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p65.71">From the perspective of the U.S government, this fall in gold is equivalent to the fall in foreign reserves. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p65.71">In fact, from 1963, foreign central banks had tried to convert their dollar reserves into gold, eventually the US was forced to abandon gold convertibility, which is symbolised by President Richard Nixon's indication on August 15, 1971, hence the eliminated the Bretton Woods System. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p65.71">Actually the post-collapse movements of exchange rate in some major countries (including the U.S) would enable this collapse to be a supporting evidence of first generation model. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p65.71">Choi (1996) gives the following figures: Yen appreciated 17%, Mark 13.5 %, Pound 9%, French Franc 9%; moreover, the gold price rose from $35 per oz to $38 per oz, which was equivalent to a dollar devaluation of 8.57%. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p65.71">The quarterly data of Yen / Dollar, Mark / Dollar and Dollar / Pound from 1971 to 1973 are plotted in Figures 1, 2 and 3 in appendix. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p65.71">It can be noticed that for Japan and Germany, exchange rates against Dollar gradually fell during 1971 and 1972, followed by a dramatic reduction in early 1973; performance in pound / dollar was different, but still, dollar depreciated more than 10% against British pound from 1971 till the first quarter in 1972. </s>
</p>
<p n="p66.71">
<s n="s1.2;p66.71">Different from the first example, foreign countries somehow performed the role of speculator against the U.S in the collapse of Bretton Woods. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p66.71">The decreasing willingness of holding dollar directly forces foreign countries absorbed gold stock in the U.S. When the U.S had exhausted its gold reserves, the fixed exchange rate regime collapsed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p67.71">
<s n="s1.2;p67.71">However, the financial crisis occurred in the 1990s, namely collapse of ERM in1992 and Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-99, can not be fully explained by this model as its inherent limitations. </s>

<p n="p68.71">
<s n="s1.6;p68.71">This model offers formal description of speculative attacks in currency markets and analyses the timing of collapse of fixed exchange rate regime from the perspective of balance-of-payment. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p68.71">Nonetheless, the model has two theoretical limitations, which are caused by the assumptions imposed. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p68.71">The first one is that this model wipes out all uncertainty in government's policy. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p68.71">The government is assumed to abandon the fixed rate regime only if reserves are exhausted. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p68.71">This is the very reason why this model is inappropriate to explain the collapse of ERM in 1992, where, according to W. Aklia (1998), "the temptation to leave the ERM was high for the U.K. The same held true for many other struggling European economies like Italy, Spain and Portugal as well as for countries like Sweden and Finland to break off their fixed exchange rate system." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0197a-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s6.6;p68.71">This indication implies that by introducing uncertainty to government's and speculators' decision making, speculators are not 100% committing attack and the government is not certainly holding the regime. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p69.71">The second limitation is that this model only focuses on circumstances with budget deficit and accordingly unable to explain those speculative attack cases without apparent problems in balance-of-payment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p69.71">For example, countries involved in 1997-99 Asian Financial Crisis were not having large budget deficits and some of them even enjoyed surplus, but speculators still attacked their currencies. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p69.71">Based on this reason, Copeland (2000) also argues: "this model (the first generation model) seemed to be no help in explaining the Asian Crisis." <ref target="BAWE_0197a-ftnote.008"/> </s>

<p n="p70.71">
<s n="s1.5;p70.71">Essentially the extensions of this model are derived from the limitations, therefore introducing uncertainty is a sensible one. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p70.71">As claimed in foregoing paragraphs, neither of ERM Crisis nor Asian Financial Crisis can be explained by this model, as paradoxes exist in both cases according to the assumptions of the model. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p70.71">Another possible extension for this model could be the removal of those limitations on government's options of cutting budget deficit. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p70.71">Besides using foreign reserves, issuing Treasury bill to foreign banks is also a possible solution; even the emergency bonds could delay the timing of collapse and probably change the result. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p70.71">Therefore extensions can be introduced to such two aspects. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p71.71">Based on several assumptions, this model offers formally describes concept of speculative attack and answers the timing question by numerical method. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p71.71">Empirical evidences of the devaluation of the pound in 1967 and the depreciated dollar in the end of Bretton Woods System are discussed in section 2. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p71.71">Because of the limitations inside, this model is not appropriate to analyse the ERM Crisis in 1992 and the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-99. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p71.71">The final section not only discusses the limitations, but also the possible extension for this model. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p71.71">This paper argues that the introduction of uncertainty will enable this model to be more realistic and more effective. </s>
