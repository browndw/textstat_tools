<s n="s6.9;p4.16">The Structuralist emphasis on binary oppositions allows us to examine the thematic contrasts within the poem. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.16">According to Levi-Strauss, it is the grammar logic within a myth that provides the symbolic structure that allows us to understand them. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.16">In applying this principle to our examination of <hi rend="italic">The</hi> <hi rend="italic">Waste Land</hi>, the preoccupation with dryness and sterility therefore defines all that water can promise; life and regeneration. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p4.16">Levi-Strauss believed that binary oppositions explain and reduce a contradiction, and, in a poem filled with contradiction, Structuralism provides an effective way to penetrate the poem's dense and abstruse imagery. </s>

<s n="s2.11;p5.16">Cultural Materialism provides an insight into the poem's thematic concerns by emphasising the need to understand its historical context. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p5.16">For example, the disruption that permeates the poem's structure is used to mirror the horror and violence of the contemporary battlefield. </s>

<s n="s2.12;p6.16">Structuralism allows us to centralise language in a poem where it is in danger of sliding into indeterminacy. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p6.16">Eliot himself viewed poetry as a site of difficulty where language must be dislocated before it can make sense, believing that; 'The poet must become ..more allusive, more indirect, in order to force..language into his meaning." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3008h-ftnote.013"/>
<s n="s4.12;p6.16">Meaning is therefore not inherent in words but given by structure; the allusive and oblique structure of <hi rend="italic">The Waste Land</hi> forces language to make meaning. </s>

<s n="s6.12;p6.16">The significance of certain surreal sound effects such as; 'jug jug jug jug,'<ref target="BAWE_3008h-ftnote.014"/> only become apparent when put into their allusive context. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p6.16">Successive allusions to Philomel's rape re-iterate the theme of assaulted innocence and danger of lust. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p6.16">In juxtaposing Spenser's idealised depiction of love with images of sordid modern sex in the third section, Eliot succeeds in showing; 'how man's aspirations to a spiritual mode of living are thwarted by his subversive bodily appetites,' according to Macrae.<ref target="BAWE_3008h-ftnote.015"/> The meaning of certain allusions are therefore only revealed through their relationships with other images. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p6.16">Eagleton is therefore just in stating that; 'Images do not have a 'substantial' meaning, only a 'relational' one. </s>
