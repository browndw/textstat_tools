<s n="s2.9;p1.17">Parfit states that the "the most important claim in the Reductionist View" of personal identity, which he holds, is that "personal identity is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> what matters"<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.002"/> in survival. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p1.17">If my present brain and body were destroyed, I should not consider it death, as long as there exists a replica of me, with my memories, intentions and the like. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.17">In "Personal Identity", Parfit argues that survival can be a matter of degree, and that we should give up the language of personal identity. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.17">But there are weaknesses with his argument that are strong enough to cast doubt on reductionist views of personal identity. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.17">My aim is not to offer a coherent theory of personal identity in its place myself, but merely to criticize Parfit, in particular his first and most important thought-experiment of a person undergoing fission. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.17">I will proceed by outlining the relevant aspects of Parfit's argument in Section I and assessing it in Section II. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p3.17">Thus, fission is not sheer fantasy, it could be possible. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p7.17">In a footnote, Parfit says that those who disagree are not necessarily making a mistake; rather, he would have to present the sceptics with a different version of the brain-transplant scenario to convince them. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p8.17">One problem is brought out by Bernard Williams in a Locke-inspired example of 'mind-swapping' where a magician switches the brain-states of an emperor and peasant, so that the emperor-body ends up with all the memories of the peasant.<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.011"/> This example is not about brain transplants <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, but it brings out the significance of us being embodied creatures, which Parfit ignores. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.17">Most people are inclined to say that the emperor-body now is the peasant, because it has all the memories and characteristics of the peasant, i.e., it is psychologically continuous with the peasant. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.17">But Williams points out that it is nearly impossible to 'be the peasant' without being embodied in the peasant's body and for example being able to smile the characteristic peasant smile. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p9.17">One could object to this by posing a new question to Williams. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p9.17">Surely, this seems absurd. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.17">The scarred woman is spatially and temporally continuous with her former self, the body has just undergone some external changes. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.17">To say that we are embodied creatures is not to say that if our body gets altered, we cease to exist. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.17">The illustrations Williams uses to make his point are perhaps not convincing enough to suggest that in brain-transplants where the two bodies are very different, too much is lost for the brain-donor to survive. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.17">But his example does point to the fact that there is a strong link between the person and her body. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.17">Perhaps it does not make sense to distinguish so clearly between body and mind and only pay attention to the mental features of the persons involved as Parfit does. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.17">
<s n="s1.11;p10.17">This takes me to what I consider to be the most pressing problem at the very core of Parfit's argument. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p10.17">This is the tension between neo-Lockean theories of personal identity and theories rooted in materialism and the idea that biological continuity is essential for survival, i.e., the animalist view. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p10.17">Parfit, a neo-Lockean, believes that one can distinguish the person from the human animal. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p10.17">A person is seen as "software", as a mode rather than a substance.<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.013"/> This software involves memory and intention and is seated in the brain. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p10.17">As long as there is a psychological connection between this software over time, one survives. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p10.17">Material or biological discontinuity is irrelevant. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p10.17">Others, like Michael Ayers, Eric Olson and P. F. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p10.17">Snowdon, disagree. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p10.17">For example, they object that if the person is not identical to the human animal, then who is sitting in a chair typing these words, the animal or the person? </s>
<s n="s10.11;p10.17">If the person is not identical to the animal, then there seems to be two simultaneous mental lives in me, the perceptions of the animals and the same perceptions of the person. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p10.17">They reject this as absurd, and conclude that the animal in the chair is me.<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.014"/> Another objection to the neo-Lockean approach is that since we are first unborn foetuses with no psychological continuity with our adult selves, our persistence conditions must be biological, not psychological.<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.015"/> The view held by Eric Olson is a useful example of a fundamentally different way to conceive of what matters in survival that challenges Parfit's fission example. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p11.17">Most likely, Olson would target the above quote from Parfit like this. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p11.17">It is very problematic that Parfit does not specify whether "my brain" means my cerebrum or my whole brain (which includes the brain stem).<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.016"/> Two sentences later, Parfit refers to David Wiggin's example of imagining my brain being divided into two. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p11.17">Here the term "brain" seems to suggest the cerebrum only, as the hemispheres can be split into two and function independently, but the brain-stem cannot. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p11.17">If we assume that Parfit means that it is only the cerebrum that is removed, one could object that I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the resulting person who has my characteristics: I am the animal body left behind, with whom I have a biological continuity. </s>

<s n="s3.12;p12.17">But Parfit is arguing that what matters is psychological continuity because it is psychological continuity that gives judgments of personal identity great importance.<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.018"/> We just need to free these important judgments from the presupposition of identity, so we can focus on what really matters: matters of merit and desert, guilt, memory and so on, matters that Olson does not discuss. </s>

<s n="s5.12;p12.17">But they do address the "almost unargued"<ref target="BAWE_0393a-ftnote.019"/> traditional and popular neo-Lockean emphasis on thought being distinct from the bodily self. </s>
