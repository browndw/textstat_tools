<s n="s1.6;p1.40">Refrigeration is defined as the elimination of heat from a material at a temperature higher than the temperature of its surroundings. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.40">The mechanism of refrigeration is a part of the freezing process and freezing storage involved in the thermodynamic aspects of freezing. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.40">According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat only flows from higher to lower temperatures. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.40">Therefore, in order to raise the heat from a lower to a higher temperature level, expenditure of work is needed. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.40">The aim of industrial refrigeration processes is to eliminate heat from low temperature points towards points with higher temperature. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.40">For this reason, either closed mechanical refrigeration cycles in which refrigeration fluids circulate, or open cryogenic systems with liquid nitrogen (LIN) or carbon dioxide (CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>), are commonly used by the food industry. </s>

<p n="p2.40">
<s n="s1.3;p2.40">The main elements in a closed mechanical refrigeration system are the condenser, compressor, evaporator, and the expansion valve. </s>

<p n="p3.40">
<s n="s1.1;p3.40">Freezing is the unit operation in which temperature of a food is reduced below the freezing point, and a proportion of the water undergoes a change in state to form ice crystals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.40">
<s n="s1.1;p4.40">The safety and nutrition quality of frozen products are emphasized when high quality raw materials are used, good manufacturing practices are employed in the preservation process, and the products are kept in accordance with specified temperatures. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.40">
<s n="s1.2;p5.40">The immobilisation of water to ice and the resulting concentration of dissolved solutes in unfrozen water lower the activity of the food. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.40">Preservation is achieved by (a) a combination of low temperatures (b) reduced water activity (c) in some foods, pre-treatment by blanching. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.40">
<s n="s1.4;p6.40">During freezing, sensible heat is first removed to lower the temperature of a food to the freezing point. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.40">Heat produced by respiration is also removed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.40">This is termed as the heat load. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.40">It is important in determining the correct size of the freezing equipment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.40">
<s n="s1.2;p7.40">Water has a high specific heat (4200kg <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>K <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>) and a high latent heat of fusion (335kJ kg <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.40">A substantial amount of energy is needed to freeze foods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.40">
<s n="s1.2;p8.40">The International Institute of Refrigeration (IIR) has provided definitions to establish a basis for the freezing process. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.40">According to their definition, the freezing process is basically divided into three stages based on major temperature changes in a particular location in the product, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 for pure water and food respectively. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p9.40">Beginning with the prefreezing stage, the food is subjected to the freezing process until the appearance of the first crystal. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.40">If the material frozen is pure water, the freezing temperature will be 0 Â°C and, up to this temperature, there will be a sub cooling until the ice formation begins. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.40">In the case of foods during this stage, the temperature decreases to below freezing temperature and, with the formation of the first ice crystal, increases to freezing temperature. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.40">The second stage is the freezing period; a phase change occurs, transforming water into ice. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.40">For pure water, temperature at this stage is constant; however, it decreases slightly in foods, due to the increasing concentration of solutes in the unfrozen water portion. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.40">The last stage starts when the product temperature reaches the point where most freezable water has been converted to ice, and ends when the temperature is reduced to storage temperature (Persson and Lohndal, 1993). </s>

<head rend="bold">Blanching</head>
<p n="p10.40">
<s n="s1.4;p10.40">Blanching is the exposure of the vegetables to boiling water or steam for a brief period of time to inactivate enzymes. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.40">The objective of blanching is to inactivate the enzymes causing detrimental changes in colour, odour, flavour, and nutritive value, but heat treatment causes loss of such characteristics in fruits (Gutschmidt, 1968). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.40">Therefore, only a few types of fruits are blanched for inactivation of enzymes prior to freezing. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.40">The loss of water-soluble minerals and vitamins during blanching should also be minimized by keeping blanching time and temperature at an optimum combination (Spiess, 1984). </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.40">
<s n="s1.5;p11.40">Practically every vegetable (except herbs and green peppers) needs to be blanched and promptly cooled prior to freezing, since heating slows or stops the enzyme action, which causes vegetables to grow and mature. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.40">After maturation, however, enzymes can cause loss in quality, flavour, colour, texture, and nutrients. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.40">If vegetables are not heated sufficiently, the enzymes will continue to be active during frozen storage and may cause the vegetables to toughen or develop off-flavours and colours. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p11.40">Blanching also causes wilting or softening of vegetables, making them easier to pack. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p11.40">It destroys some bacteria and helps remove any surface dirt (Desrosier and Tressler, 1977). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.40">
<s n="s1.3;p12.40">Blanching in hot water at 70 to 105 Â°C has been associated with the destruction of enzyme activity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.40">Blanching is usually carried out between 75 and 95 Â°C for 1 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of individual vegetable pieces (Holdsworth, 1983). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.40">Blanched vegetables should be promptly cooled down to control and minimize the degradation of soluble and heat-labile nutrients (Deitrich <hi rend="italic">et al.,</hi> 1977). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.40">
<s n="s1.2;p13.40">The enzymes used as indicators of effectiveness of the blanching treatment are peroxidase, catalase, and more recently lipoxygenase. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.40">Peroxidase inactivation is commonly used in vegetable processing, since peroxidase is easily detected and is the most heat stable of these enzymes (Arthey, 1993). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.40">
<s n="s1.9;p14.40">Vegetables can be blanched in hot water, steam, and in the microwave. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p14.40">Hot water blanching is the most common way of processing vegetables. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p14.40">Blanching times for various vegetables can vary depending on the intended product use. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p14.40">For water blanching, vegetables are put in a basket and then placed in a kettle of boiling water covered with a lid. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p14.40">Steam blanching takes longer than the water method, but helps retain water-soluble nutrients such as water-soluble vitamins. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p14.40">For steam blanching, a single layer of vegetables is placed on a rack or in a basket at 3-5 cm above water boiling in a kettle. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p14.40">A tightly fitted lid is placed on the kettle and timing is started. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p14.40">Microwave blanching is usually recommended for small quantities of vegetables prior to freezing. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p14.40">Due to the non-uniform heating disadvantage of microwaves, research is still being conducted to obtain better results with microwave blanching. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.40">
<s n="s1.3;p15.40">Tests for catalase and polyphenol oxidase activity were tested after blanching by using Guaicol. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p26.40">Thus, when the geometrical center of the product reaches the given final temperature, this ensures the average product temperature has been reduced to a storage value. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.40">Freezing time depends on several factors, including the initial and final temperatures of the product and the quantity of heat removed, as well as dimensions (especially thickness) and shape of product, heat transfer process, and temperature. </s>
