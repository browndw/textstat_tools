<p n="p1.10">
<s n="s1.7;p1.10">Normalised means that the steel has been heated to approximately 800-900ºc then left to cool 'normally' in air. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.10">This is a very slow cooling rate so the austenite transforms fully into ferrite and pearlite. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.10">Pearlite is a lamellar structure of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.10">Pearlite is hard and it gives the steel strength. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.10">Ferrite is soft, and gives the steel ductility and toughness. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.10">If the amount of carbon in the steel is increased, this increases the amount of pearlite in the steel. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.10">This has the effect of increasing the strength, but it also decreases the ductility and toughness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.10">
<s n="s1.6;p2.10">Tempering is a process that involves reheating the already quenched steel. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.10">Quenching steel transforms the austenite to a partially or completely martensitic microstructure. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.10">The martensite is extremely hard and brittle. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.10">To regain some ductility the steel is reheated to a temperature in the range of 200 to 600ºc. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.10">This allows some of the body centred cubic of martensite to transform to pearlite and/or ferrite. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.10">Tempered steel is harder and stronger than the normalised steel, but has less ductility. </s>

<p n="p3.10">
<s n="s1.4;p3.10">A general trend (of EN6A samples) shows that as the test temperature increases the fracture energy increases. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.10">From observation of the broken samples it can be said that brittle fracture occurred (Figure 1). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.10">Brittle fracture takes place when failure develops along the cleavage planes of individual crystals. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.10">This gives the fracture surface its 'glittery' appearance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.10">
<s n="s1.10;p4.10">The sample of EN1A took almost five times the energy of EN6A to fracture. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p4.10">This is because EN1A has a smaller carbon content (0.1% compared to 0.4%) than EN6A. As mentioned in the theory an increase in carbon corresponds to an increase of pearlite and therefore a decrease in ferrite. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.10">Pearlite is hard and brittle, whereas ferrite is soft and ductile. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.10">So EN6A is more brittle than EN1A, brittle materials are more prone to fracture. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.10">Ductile materials will have some resistance to fracture. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.10">Upon failure they don't leave a 'clean' break whereas brittle materials do. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.10">Ductile materials have the appearance of layers being 'ripped' apart (Figure 2), the surface is said to be 'fibrous'. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.10">Plastic deformation is associated with ductile failure. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.10">The material is taken past its 'limit of proportionality' and into its plastic region. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p4.10">This deformation is permanent and unrecoverable after load is released. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.10">Series 1&amp;2 are the results obtained during this laboratory session, the rest are from previous sessions. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.10">There is a lot of variation between the results of corresponding temperatures. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.10">This is due to the difficulty of heat treatment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.10">Also the samples used in previous sessions might be from different batches. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.10">There may be discrepancy of re-quench time and/or furnace reheat time. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.10">Re-quench was done it batches of three samples, therefore the middle sample may have cooled slightly slower giving it a higher pearlitic structure and slightly more ductility. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6159i-fig.002"/>
<p n="p6.10">
<s n="s1.5;p6.10">The graph shows increasing fracture energy with increasing tempering temperature. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.10">The higher the tempering temperature the higher the proportion of martensite that gets transformed back to austenite. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.10">On re-quench (dependant upon cooling rate) this austenite shall be transformed into a proportion of pearlite and ferrite. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.10">This will give the tempered steel a higher proportion of pearlite/ferrite than the original quenched steel. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.10">Therefore it shall have more ductility and a greater ability to withstand fracture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.10">
<s n="s1.1;p7.10">So...higher temp more austenite more pearlite/ferrite greater ductility Increased fracture energy. </s>

<p n="p9.10">
<s n="s1.4;p9.10">This graph is consistent with the previous results. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p9.10">The higher the tempering temperature the lower the crystalline percentage. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p9.10">Again this is because, higher tempering temperature gives more pearlite/ferrite that in turn gives greater ductility and resistance to fracture. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p9.10">Crystalline appearance is associated with brittle steels of low temperature. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.10">
<s n="s1.6;p10.10">The results show the correct trend but the 200ºc result is extremely low. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p10.10">The 400ºc is just about matches the theoretical and the 600ºc is slightly too high. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p10.10">Series four samples would probably give the best crystalline percentage results. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.10">This is because its 200ºc fracture energy is less than half of the used sample, so it is more brittle giving a higher crystalline structure. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.10">Its 400ºc is approximately the same as the used sample and its 600ºc's fracture energy is about 10% higher than the used sample. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.10">Therefore it would be more ductile and should give a completely fibrous fracture. </s>
