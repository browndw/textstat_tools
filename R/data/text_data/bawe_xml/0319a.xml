<s n="s1.4;p1.52">The labor theory of value occupies a fundamental place in Marx's works. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.52">Just as alienated labour is a key theme in his early works, the labour theory of value marks Marx's transition from the philosophical criticism of inhuman capitalist production to the scientific exploration of the capitalist economy system. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.52">At first glance, the labour theory of value seems to be a mere elaboration of Ricardo's theory of value, which complements the latter with a dimension of history, and because of this, Marx is often regarded by some scholars as a conclusive figure among political economists. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.52">Such a reading, however, does not exhaust the rich implication of Marx's theory. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.52">
<s n="s1.5;p2.52">There are two concepts yet to define: labor and value. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.52">As these two words could comprise various meanings, from the most concrete to the most abstract. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.52">What is their meaning here? </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.52">What is their relationship and why? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.52">Does this relationship apply to all epochs in the history or specifically to capitalist production? </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.52">
<s n="s1.5;p3.52">In this argument, the author will try to solve the questions above. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.52">In the first three sections, the definition of value and labor and their interrelation will be discussed in detail. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.52">Based on that, in the following section, the attention will be shifted to the production and exchange process in which the interrelation of labor and value could be studied on a larger scale. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.52">The phenomenon of commodity fetishism will also be discussed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.52">Finally, we will talk about how labor theory of value provides a better image of social relation than that of classical political economists. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.52">
<s n="s1.2;p4.52">Through the discussion, the author tries to point out that here the concept of value and labour is specific to the commodity production. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.52">The labour theory of value reveals the distinctive organization of capitalistic economy system and sheds light on the whole societal structure of bourgeois society. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold italic">Two Interpretations of Value and Labour</head>
<p n="p5.52">
<s n="s1.2;p5.52">In the first chapter of Capital, Marx pointed out three opposing pairs: use-value/value, concrete labour/abstract labour and private labour/social labour. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.52">Different interpretations of their relationship lead to different evaluations of Marx's labour theory of value and his whole analysis of capitalist society. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.52">
<s n="s1.5;p6.52">One of these interpretations argues that there are two kinds of production: production of use-value and production of value. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.52">Use-value is 'an external object,' (Marx, 1976: 125) an intrinsic quality, 'conditioned by the physical properties of a thing.' 'They constitute the material content of wealth, whatever its social form maybe.' (Marx, 1976: 126) </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.52">Accordingly, the concrete labour which produces use-value is also trans-historical; it is a 'natural condition of human existence, a condition of material interchange of man and nature, quite independent of the form of society.'(Marx, 1971: 36) </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.52">As the use-value production appears to be irreverent of the social form, it naturally follows that the use-value production could take place privately. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.52">Isolated people can carry on concrete labour respectively in their own place without much social contact with others. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.52">
<s n="s1.7;p7.52">Likewise, abstract labour is value-producing labour, which appears to be the abstraction of various concrete labours. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p7.52">For example, weaving and tailing are two distinctive concrete labours, differing in 'aim, mode of operation, object, means and result,'(Marx, 1976: 132) but they share some common characters: they are both 'an expenditure of human labour-power', 'both a productive expenditure of human brains, muscles, nerves, hands etc., and in this sense both human labour.'(Marx, 1976: 134) </s>
<s n="s3.7;p7.52">Because of this, they are equal in the physiological sense. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.52">The only difference is not qualitative, but quantitative, determined by different duration of labour-time, so they could be compared in the market, in the society. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.52">Abstract labour is also social labour as they confer social quality on commodities. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.52">The value and abstract labour thus appear to emerge from the abstraction of diverse use-values and use labours. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.52">They are, in this way, trans-historical concepts also. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.52">
<s n="s1.4;p8.52">This interpretation of their relationship into two parallel lines: use-value - concrete labour - private labour and value - abstract labour - social labour, however oversimplifies Marx's labour theory of value, reducing it to Ricardo's theory of value. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.52">The value remains embodied human labour, determined out of the social relation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.52">The market serves only as an arena where quantitatively varying commodities compare their inner value. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.52">The exchange remains a mere technical process while the value is already predetermined before the exchange process. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.52">
<s n="s1.3;p9.52">Without the consideration of the social form of value, the labour theory of value is reduced to the explanation of the quantitative relation between commodities, which is in fact, what Marx aimed to criticize. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.52">Actually, the quantitative exchange relation between commodities or the price-form is the most visible appearance of commodity economy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.52">It serves to be the staring point for Marx's whole enquiry to uncover the underlying secret of capitalist economy system behind the price-form, money-form and later developed capital form. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.52">
<s n="s1.3;p10.52">Diane Elson would disagree with such a separation and the regrouping of these six concepts into two categories, the private and the social. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.52">Though she admits that there is a tendency to suggest that 'abstract' means the same as 'social', and 'concrete' the same as 'private', she insists that these categories are nevertheless distinct and must not be collapsed into one. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.52">(Elson, 1979: 145) </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.52">
<s n="s1.2;p11.52">In her essay 'The Value Theory of Labour', she brings out another interpretation of the meanings and interrelation of four categories of labour: concrete, abstract, private and social labour. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.52">She argues that:' </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">The four categories that we have been discussing are thus concepts of four potentia, which can never exist on their own as determinate form of labour. Labour always has its abstract and concrete, its social and private aspects. Marx poses any particular determinate form of labour as a precipitate of these four different aspects of labour. What is specific to a particular kind of society is the relation of these aspects to one another and the way in which they are represented in the precipitated forms. (Elson, 1979: 149)</quote>
<p n="p12.52">
<s n="s1.4;p12.52">The four concepts are actually four aspects of the same labour. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.52">Concrete labour is no more concrete than abstract labour, just as abstract labour is no more abstract than concrete labour, because they are both one-sided abstraction of the same labour. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.52">It is the same case with private and social labour. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.52">They are in this way pertaining to all epochs of history, though the way they relate to each other varies in different epochs of history. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.52">
<s n="s1.3;p13.52">In the specific condition of capitalism, the distinction between the two pairs tend, as practical reality, to be obliterated; the concrete aspect of labour is privatized' and the social aspect of labour is 'abstracted'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.52">(Elson, 1979: 149) This is the appearance, but essence is that 'in capitalistic society the abstract aspect is dominant. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.52">The social character of labour is established precisely through the representation of the abstract aspect of labour.' (Elson, 1979: 149) </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.52">
<s n="s1.8;p14.52">Abstract labour is not the common character shared by various distinctive concrete labours. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p14.52">It is not derived from the abstraction of concrete labours, not a derivative aspect, but <hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p14.52">'It is not an assumption that all work is physiologically identical. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p14.52">Rather, it draws attention to the fact that all work takes the time and effort, irrespective of what kind of work it is'. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p14.52">(Elson, 1979: 148) </s>
<s n="s6.8;p14.52">In capitalist society, abstract labour dominates concrete labour, provides the social form into which the latter enters. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p14.52">Therefore, the concrete labour ceases to be 'the concept of a 'given', determinated reality upon which social relations are superimposed'. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p14.52">(Elson, 1979: 147) </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.52">
<s n="s1.2;p15.52">The concept abstract labour overlaps somehow with the concept the social labour, as both are viewed as collective activity, without concerning who is the particular labourer. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.52">'What the concept of labour adds to the concept of social labour is the idea of quantity, labour is viewed not simply as part of a collective effort, but as a definite fraction of a quantitatively specified total.' (Elson, 1979: 148) </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.52">
<s n="s1.5;p16.52">We could clearly see the difference between these two interpretations: the first interpretation puts the same weight on use-value and value, concrete and abstract labour, private and social labour, without noticing the inner relationship within each pair, and therefore disregards the particularity of labour production in the capitalist economy system. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p16.52">In other words, it tacitly agrees that value production is just as natural as the use-value production without questioning its validity. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p16.52">Value appears to be imposed by abstract labour and becomes inherent in the commodity. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p16.52">They could be compared in the market as they are both crystallized abstract labour, differing only in the duration of labour time. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p16.52">In this way such an interpretation naturally leads to a doctrine of determination of the quantitative relation of commodities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.52">
<s n="s1.3;p17.52">The second interpretation maintains that these categories of labour pertain to all epochs of history, but in capitalist society, their relation is represented in a unique way that the abstract labour dominates concrete labour. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.52">The social form of labour should be taken into consideration even before the concrete labour takes place. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.52">Thus from the qualitative standpoint, the social form of value and labour should be addressed first before analyzing the quantitative relation of commodities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.52">
<s n="s1.7;p18.52">However, there still remain some questions unsolved. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p18.52">Firstly, the author did not talk much about use-value and value. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p18.52">Though it is implied in the analysis of four categories of labour, it is still worth thinking about. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p18.52">Secondly, Elson did not give a very clear answer to: How does abstract labour dominate concrete labour? </s>
<s n="s5.7;p18.52">How does concrete labour takes the social form? </s>
<s n="s6.7;p18.52">In the next section, these questions will be further discussed. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p18.52">In the following two sections, we try to undertake these two tasks respectively. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Value and Abstract Labour</head>
<p n="p19.52">
<s n="s1.5;p19.52">Among all these categories, use-value seems to be the most simple and obvious. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.52">'As far as it is a use-value, there is nothing mysterious about it.'(Marx, 1976: 163) </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.52">It is true, but it does not license us to regard use-value as the eternal quality and be determinated out of human interference. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.52">'Every useful thing...may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity'. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.52">(Marx, 1976: 125) </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">The discovery of these ways and hence of the manifold uses of things is the work of history. So also is the invention of socially recognized standards of measurement for the quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of the measures for commodities arises in part from the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, and in part from convention. (Marx, 1976: 125-126)</quote>
<p n="p20.52">
<s n="s1.3;p20.52">Both the 'quality' and 'quantity' of use-value is to some extent determined in human society, under the mediation of human beings in a definite historical epoch. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.52">Therefore, from this perspective, use-value ceases to be an eternal or trans-historical concept. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.52">Though this concept could apply to all epochs of history, say, pre-capitalist, capitalist and post-capitalist, it can only be fully grasped in the background of certain stage of human society. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.52">
<s n="s1.5;p21.52">Nevertheless, the mystery of community production stems more from value than from use-value. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.52">Then what is value? </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.52">Value is expressly exhibited by exchange-value. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.52">Then what is exchange value? </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.52">Exchange-value appears to be 'the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which the use-values of one kind exchange for use value is another kind' (Marx, 1976: 126) Exchange-value stems from the relation of commodities of different use-value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.52">
<s n="s1.2;p22.52">'This form of manifestation is exchange-value, and the commodity never has this form when looked in isolation, but only when it is in a value-relation or an exchange relation with a second commodity of a different kind.'(Marx, 1976: 152) 'The expression x commodity A= x commodity A would not be a value equation,' in that the value of commodity A can't expressed its value in itself. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.52">'An individual commodity taken in isolation is incapable of manifesting its own value.' (Sayer, 1979: 25) </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.52">
<s n="s1.4;p23.52">However, this definition of value, 'value expresses itself in exchange-value, which can only be understood in relation with other commodities of different use-value', is not a satisfactory one. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.52">It is more of description than definition and it has not touched the essence of value. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.52">Then, the question remained: what is value? </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.52">This time we turn to the substance of value: abstract labour. </s>

<p n="p24.52">
<s n="s1.4;p24.52">Value is produced by abstract labour. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.52">Abstract labour, at first glance, emerges in the negative way: 'If we leave aside the determinate quality of productive activity, and therefore the useful character of the labour, what remains is its quality of being an expenditure of human labour-power.'(Marx, 1976: 134) </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.52">As we have discussed in the first section, viewing abstract labour as the residue after subtraction of concrete labour leads to the abstraction of abstract labour. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.52">It is neither a mere physiological concept, 'the expenditure of human brains, muscles, nerves, hands etc.' (Marx, 1976: 134) </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.52">
<s n="s1.1;p25.52">Here Marx's comment on Ricardo might offer some clues: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">He is at least aware that the operation of the law depends on definite historical pre-conditions. He says that the determination of value by labour time applies to "such commodities only as can be increased in quantity by the exertion of human industry, and on the production of which competition operates without restraint" This in fact means that the full development of the law of value presuppose a society in which large-scale industrial production and free competition obtain, in other words, modern bourgeois society. (Marx, 1971: 60) </quote>
<p n="p26.52">
<s n="s1.4;p26.52">The quotation shows that the reading of abstract labour above is only a logical deduction without taking its historical quality into consideration. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.52">Abstract labour, therefore, could only be understood in a definite social background also. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.52">The emergence of it coincides with the introduction of machine, with large-scale commodity production, with the formation of social and production relation within the bourgeois society. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.52">Let's discuss in detail. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.52">
<s n="s1.7;p27.52">Abstract labour is 'the expenditure of simple labour-power, i.e. of the labour-power possessed in his bodily organism by every ordinary man, on the average, without being developed in any special way.'(Marx, 1976: 135) </s>
<s n="s2.7;p27.52">It is simple because 'any average individual can be trained to do and which in one way or another he has to perform'. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p27.52">(Marx, 1971: 31) What's more, 'the labour contained in these values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and linen, but only as being an expenditure of human labour-power.'(Marx, 1976: 136) </s>
<s n="s4.7;p27.52">It does not matter who is the labourer of one product, since the individuality and particularity of labour is no longer so important. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p27.52">From this perspective, abstract labour is somehow similar to what Marx described as alienated labour in his early works: 'The labour is external to the worker... </s>
<s n="s6.7;p27.52">His worker is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p27.52">It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it...it (the product) is not his own, but someone else's.' (Marx, 1971: 137) </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.52">
<s n="s1.7;p28.52">Though with a strong philosophical and humanistic flavour, the paragraph expressed roughly the same meaning: in the capitalist society, the direct relation between labourer and his product loosened. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p28.52">The product of labour is no longer the direct use-value to its producer. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p28.52">Thus the labour or production process is reduced to a means of life, not life itself. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p28.52">The importance of the particularity of labour decreases coincides with the loosening relation between labourer and product. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p28.52">The quality of labour is overtaken by the quantity, the duration of labour time. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p28.52">Hence, abstract labour could be measured by labour-time because of it is simple and average labour-power. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p28.52">Its being simple and average is due to its specific productive relation in capitalist society. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.52">
<s n="s1.6;p29.52">The second important aspect of abstract labour is its social character, 'social however not in the general sense but in the particular sense, denoting a specific type of society'. </s>

<s n="s6.6;p29.52">It is the same case with the social labour in the Middle Ages, in the communal society: their social labour does not possess the quality of being universal equal. </s>

Thus while in the exchange process commodities become use-values for one another by discarding all determinate form and confronting one another in their immediate physical aspect, they must assume a new determinate form, they must evolve money, so as to confront one another as exchange-values.
