<p n="p1.39">
<s n="s1.10;p1.39">The concept of security has substantially evolved since the end of the Cold War. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.39">Far from a traditional, realistic, militarised and state-centred concept, the debate now includes a comprehensive approach to security problems. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.39">This evolution can be seen as a real opportunity to minimize the importance of the sovereign state in the concern problematic of human security. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.39">But it also contains several pitfalls. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.39">If everything that causes a decline in human well-being is labelled a 'security' threat, the term loses any analytical usefulness and becomes vaguely synonymous with 'bad'. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.39">In this essay I will try to question the polemical nature of global security through the securitization of the environment. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.39">The notion of environmental security is considered today as an issue of global security. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.39">The problem is that both concepts of environmental security and global security are used as if they were self-evident. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.39">What are the implications of the securitization of the environment on the perception of what global security is? </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.39">Behind the label of 'global security', we imply not a utopian consensual cooperation of all the nations toward the betterment of everyone's security, but rather a discourse, a way for the powers to impose their views and maintain the status quo. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.39">
<s n="s1.2;p2.39">In order to challenge the accepted concept of global security, I analyze it as a discourse as defined by Foucault. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.39">Then, in order to further analyze how this specific discourse develops, I focus the study on the implication of the securitization of the environment, more precisely of 'sustainable development' as a narrative within the global security discourse. </s>

<head rend="bold">What do we commonly understand by 'global security'? </head>
<p n="p3.39">
<s n="s1.7;p3.39">A security issue is an issue that threatens one's security and life; and which is politically responded to. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.39">What is the difference between global security focused on human security or international human rights law and global justice? </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.39">Is global security the product of the extension, horizontally (considering more than the military power) and vertically (including referent objects other than the state), of the traditional conception of security, by the incorporation of more levels of analysis and more issues? </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.39">Does global security comply with the holistic principle according to which the security of every actor is intrinsically linked? </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.39">The difficulty in the task of defining 'global security' arises when the limits between security and the infinite number of threats that constitute life have to be justified. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.39">All threats to human-beings are potentially threats to security. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.39">How does a threat become a security concern? </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.39">
<s n="s1.1;p4.39">Traditionally, security has been analysed from a Western historical perspective, as a state-centred-military concept opposed to human security. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.39">
<s n="s1.2;p5.39">Security is a questioned concept, whose meaning is subjective and fluid, changing along with spatio-temporal context, and if a physical, economic or psychological approach is taken. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.39">For instance, realists interpret environmental security as access to resources and the use of the environment as a weapon; pluralists focus on the role of international legal regimes and organizations; and structuralists understand the linkages between northern over-consumption, southern poverty and environmental degradation as provoking environmental insecurity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.39">
<s n="s1.4;p6.39">How to think then a coherent concept of global security? </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.39">Risks are everywhere but of various intensity and different for everyone. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.39">The supposed universal applicability and validity of the concept must be questioned and challenged. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.39">I want to undertake this task by questioning the concept of global security as a discourse. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.39">
<s n="s1.1;p7.39">In the current interdependent context, trans-, supra- and sub-national and national entities are actors which interact with each others. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.39">
<s n="s1.1;p8.39">The different situations in the North and in the South, where people are burdened by debt, political unrest, environmental degradation, ineffective administrative structures, question the concept of global security as an abstraction imposed to a complex and differential reality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.39">
<s n="s1.2;p9.39">In order to challenge the concept of 'global security', I will analyze it as a discourse. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.39">First, we need to understand what a discourse as defined by Foucault is, and then I will try to apply this notion to 'global security'. </s>

<head rend="bold">What is a discourse ? </head>
<p n="p10.39">
<s n="s1.2;p10.39">What is reality, what is the world? </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.39">The world and our consciousness of it are effects of the representations we have of it, as Kant theorized the way the categories of the mind project themselves to encompass what we perceive as reality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.39">
<s n="s1.4;p11.39">According to Foucault, discourses are bodies of knowledge and produce disciplines - intellectual and institutional. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.39">Foucault was referring to science, medicine and sociology to describe intellectual disciplines, and to the prison, the school, the hospital as disciplinary institutions of social control. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.39">In this essay, I consider International Law, International Relations theory as intellectual disciplines and the system of the United Nations, NATO and conferences like the 1972 World Commission on Environment and Development as disciplinary institutions. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.39">Indeed, International Law has been analyzed as the reproduction of a colonial type of power relations between the North (which possesses expertise and knowledge) and the South. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.39">
<s n="s1.6;p12.39">The concept of discourse highlights the relations between disciplines (bodies of knowledge) and disciplinary practices (institutions of social control). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.39">Global security is a discourse in the sense that it refers to a specific area of social knowledge. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.39">It is everything that constrains and enables at the same time to write, speak and think within a particular discipline and historical period. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.39">Historically contextualized, a discourse is therefore a specific way to say, write, think and construct the truth. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.39">There is no universal truth about what global security is. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.39">It is a discourse within the framework of a specific relation between a discipline and disciplinary institutions that creates a specific reality. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.39">
<s n="s1.5;p13.39">Discourses function according to power relations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.39">The language, through which the global security issues are formulated, is an instance of power. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.39">Discourse highlights the role of power in the production of knowledge. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.39">There is an essential link between power relations and their capacity to produce the truths we live in. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.39">Truth is the product of scientific knowledge and expertise and is produced through power, and power is exercised through the production of truth<ref target="BAWE_0409e-ftnote.001"/>. </s>

<p n="p15.39">
<s n="s1.2;p15.39">The strength and particularity of a discourse is to make a polemical notion look non-polemical, to make power relations look like consensus. </s>

</p>
<p n="p16.39">
<s n="s1.4;p16.39">An issue becomes a security issue when it is viewed and treated as an urgent priority in a political discourse. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p16.39">Security is not an objective concept but depends very much on one's capacity to make his/her fears or interests heard. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.39">Even if global security is a concept whose aim is to shift the authorship of security issues from the sovereign state to local, regional or global non-state entities, the state remains the actor who secures threatened people: it chooses which issue to prioritize. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p19.39">This relation is essential to the reiteration of global security discourse since international law, as a symbolic and post-colonial tool of domination, provides the words, the institutions, the methods and the framework necessary to deploy a discourse. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p19.39">Every aspects of the discourse have to be defined into legal terms in order to gain the authoritative legitimacy necessary to be imposed to the international community. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p19.39">For instance, 'sustainable development' is a legal concept created by the 1972 World Commission on Environment and Development and elaborated by the 1987 Bruntland Report which followed. </s>

<s n="s7.8;p19.39">A legal discourse is produced within a certain temporality which corresponds to the long-term temporality of international law. </s>
