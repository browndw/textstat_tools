<s n="s2.4;p2.11">This can partially be contributed to women's improvements in education, as well as women's general movement from the domestic to the public sphere. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.11">In the 1970s many feminists called for equal pay for equal value as women's pay was commonly less than her males equivalents. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p3.11">The family wage was supported heavily by trade unions in the 1970s and many used this as a reason for women not gaining equal pay.<ref target="BAWE_0392a-ftnote.003"/> The decline in the family wage in the last twenty years has also been cited by many as the reason women need to work in the modern climate, as families need two wages. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.11">However there is evidence that women have always worked to gain extra household money when needed.<ref target="BAWE_0392a-ftnote.004"/> One of the key problems when analysing economic equality is distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate equality. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.11">Legitimate equality exists when some one has the freedom of choice and their choices result in equality, where as illegitimate inequality exists when the people involved have no choice to the path they take.<ref target="BAWE_0392a-ftnote.005"/> With reference to the family wage traditionally many women have been unable to enter the public sphere (illegitimate inequality), where as now women have the choice but many still choose to stay at home (legitimate inequality). </s>

<s n="s3.5;p4.11">If you possess a skill needed by others they will pay you for it, some skills such as doctors, lawyers are valued more highly than others and so receive higher pay. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.11">Many feminists critique that those skills which have a higher value are traditional male careers, those careers which use traditionally female skills such as care work are rewarded less economically.<ref target="BAWE_0392a-ftnote.006"/> For there to be a true equality materialist feminists believe that the economy needs to be restructured so that those careers with feminine skills such as care work receive comparable pay with male dominated careers. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.11">To extend this argument further women's work which is currently not rewarded economically such as looking after children or caring for the elderly also needs to be financially rewarded. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p5.11">In the past a woman was often unable to leave an unhappy marriage not only because of stigma but because the wife was reliant on the husbands wage for survival. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.11">Since women have entered the workplace there has been an increase in the number of divorces, one reason for this may be because women are now able to support themselves outside of marriage.<ref target="BAWE_0392a-ftnote.008"/> Having financial independence also gives women more bargaining power in other areas of their lives. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.11">Women who work full time may have more bargaining power with her partner in the completion of household duties although the extent to which this is true is debatable.<ref target="BAWE_0392a-ftnote.009"/> Women can also choose what to spend their money on, if a man is the sole earner a women is dependent on him giving her some form of access to the money and possibly controlling what she spends it on. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p6.11">We could redistribute money so traditionally female roles receive more recognition but this may cause a shortage in other skills such as doctors, as the current system rewards doctors for the long years spent studying. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p7.11">Part time wok is often situated in lower paid jobs and the flexibility of it can lead to instability as well as part time workers having fewer rights and privileges as their full time counterparts. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p11.11">This idea has been criticised by many feminists as the redistribution of income based on a patriarchal model rewards those attributes connected with men. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.11">So to combat this we would have to combat the current structure of pay, distributing pay more highly amongst caring and more female orientated careers, however this model only rewards those women who are working within the public sphere. </s>
