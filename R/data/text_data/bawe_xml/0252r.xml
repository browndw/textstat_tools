<s n="s1.2;p1.63">The fall of the Bastille in July 1789 marked the beginning of what was to become a cataclysmic course of events in the history of France: the French Revolution. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.63">The political, social and cultural landscape of the French nation was so irrevocably transformed by the course of the Revolution that by 1795, the end of the period under scrutiny, it was barely recognisable from the absolute monarchical France of 1784. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.63">
<s n="s1.4;p2.63">The effects of the Revolution reached out into all corners of life; culture as well as politics took on novel forms. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.63">The subject of artistic and cultural works from this period should not be treated as 'autonomous phenomenon'<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.001"/>; they provide a unique insight into the extent of its upheaval. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.63">In undertaking an intensive analysis of the themes and principles given attention in the most influential paintings of this era, a social history of Revolutionary art can be formed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.63">In contrast to traditional art history, such an approach can help the viewer to understand these pieces as both products and, at times, producers of the Revolutionary milieu. </s>
</p>

<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Boime, Albert, <hi rend="italic">Art in an Age of Revolution, 1750-1800</hi> (Chicago; London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987), p.xix </s>

</note>
<p n="p3.63">
<s n="s1.5;p3.63">The period in question incorporates what might be seen as three broad stages of the French Revolution. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.63">The first, 1784-89, in truth preceded the commencement of the Revolution. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.63">However, the significance of these years cannot be underestimated, for it is during this time that the environment took shape into which the Revolution could explode in 1789. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.63">As such, debate rages between art historians as to whether the influential paintings of this period can be said to anticipate the principles that were to become those espoused by revolutionaries by the end of the 1780s.<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.002"/> With hindsight perhaps leading one to believe that the artistic context might well be expected to indicate the origins of the Revolution, it is important to analyse the extent to which these paintings truly represent a rupture from the past. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.63">Republican imagery comes to the fore as the most crucial element in need of attention, arguably being used to uphold and promote the Bourbon monarchy or, by contrast, to indicate the need for an alternative form of governance. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.002">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The main figures involved in this debate have been L.D. Ettlinger, Hugh Honour, Anita Brookner, Antoine Schnapper and Robert Herbert. </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">A full discussion can be found in Roberts, Warren, <hi rend="italic">Jacques-Louis David, Revolutionary Artist: Art, Politics, and the French Revolution</hi> (Chapel Hill; London: University of North Carolina Press, 1989). </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.63">
<s n="s1.3;p4.63">The years 1789-92 represent the most optimistic of the French Revolution. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.63">The formation of a National Assembly incorporating the nobility, clergy and Third Estate, and the design of a constitution which handed sovereignty to the body of the people, inspired feelings of fraternity and patriotism amongst the nation's new political leaders. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.63">Painting similarly intercepted such ideals, reflecting the atmosphere of unity and optimism. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.63">
<s n="s1.5;p5.63">The final stage under scrutiny here represents something of a turning point in the history of the French Revolution. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.63">Growing suspicions about the King's support for the Constitution, confirmed by the flight attempt aborted at Varennes, coupled with growing military crisis, led to the forced removal of the monarchy on 10 August. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.63">The subsequent creation of the National Convention marked the first step towards initiating the period known as the Terror, during which many thousands were executed by guillotine for crimes against the nation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.63">Intense fears of counter-revolution meant these years became characterised by surveillance, suspicion and violence, all in the name of upholding the new French Republic. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.63">In response, painting was called upon to promote Revolutionary values with much greater intensity, its task to guarantee the maintenance of public support.<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.003"/> By 1794, it was seen as a critical form of propaganda for the Revolutionary government. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.63">It is clear that this period is crucial to understanding the role that paintings played in the Revolution. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p7.63">Almost as soon as the Revolution began, David emerged as its 'official painter'.<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.004"/> Huge debate exists around whether his influential <hi rend="italic">Oath of the Horatii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brutus and the Lictors</hi> represent pre-Revolutionary paintings. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p7.63">In addition, David's artistic, and later political, involvement with the French Revolution was significant. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p7.63">He drew upon his expertise to 'popularise the cause of the Revolution'<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.005"/> and his paintings are seen to represent the most significant attempt at Revolutionary propaganda. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p7.63">As Tocqueville asserted, cultural leaders became 'a power in the land'<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.006"/> during the Revolution, and as a result of his (albeit disputed) role in overcoming the restricted modes of political expression in <hi rend="italic">ancien régime</hi> France, David was one of the most significant. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p7.63">As Honour indicates, he came to be seen as 'the perfect political artist'.<ref target="BAWE_0252r-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<s n="s1.4;p12.63">This is perhaps best exemplified in the <hi rend="italic">Oath of the Horatii</hi> (fig. </s>
