<p n="p1.41">
<s n="s1.2;p1.41">The following report discusses the findings of our evaluation of six bread-making machines and focuses on their critical assessment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.41">The bread-makers were assessed according to various criteria. </s>
</p>
<list type="simple">
<item rend="bold">Panasonic Automatic Bread Maker SD253</item>
<item rend="bold">Cookworks Automatic Bread Maker</item>
<item rend="bold">Morphy Richards Fastbake, Coolwall Bread Maker</item>

<head rend="bold">Specification: Market &amp; Performance</head>
<p n="p2.41">
<s n="s1.1;p2.41">The markets for these products are those of us who prefer to bake our own fresh bread for quality reasons but have neither the time nor the inclination to knead it out ourselves or perhaps for those of us who consume a lot of bread so that a bread-maker would provide economical and readily available bread or customers who like to bake a variety of breads or perhaps even gadget enthusiasts. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.41">
<s n="s1.7;p3.41">At the top end there is the Panasonic, Kenwood and Large Breville, all of which are priced at over £100. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.41">At the bottom end there is the Cookworks, Morphy Richards and the Small Breville, which are priced at under £100 (see price table). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.41">There is therefore a clear inconsistency in prices, and a £48 gap between the expensive and inexpensive groups. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.41">This is perhaps due to the different objectives of the manufacturers. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.41">So that for the inexpensive group of bread-makers the manufacturer aims to maximise sales, hence the low price. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.41">Whereas for those bread-makers that are at the top end the aim is perhaps to retain the manufacturer's reputation for quality associated with the brand name (i.e. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.41">Panasonic, Kenwood). </s>
</p>
<table id="BAWE_6103b-tab.001">

</table>
<p n="p4.41">
<s n="s1.3;p4.41">There are possibly two markets that can be suited to the different group of bread-makers in this comparison. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.41">For the inexpensive appliances the suitable market might be the "gadget" enthusiasts who are those customers that do not necessary require a bread-maker for practical reasons but more for collection purposes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.41">This is perhaps the reason why one of the cheap machines, the Morphy Richards, has an appealing aesthetic design. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.41">
<s n="s1.2;p5.41">There are also many products on the market today that serve well only as gifts, for instance a husband's gift to his wife. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.41">Perhaps then the inexpensive bread-makers are also aimed at such markets. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.41">
<s n="s1.2;p6.41">On the other hand, the more expensive bread-makers would suit customer who require their bread-makers for more practical purposes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.41">Therefore functional performance and special features such as the <hi rend="italic">fastbake</hi> (common to the Panasonic and Kenwood) or the <hi rend="italic">Fan-assisted</hi> Large Breville, are given priority which in turn increases the market price for these appliances. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Performance &amp; Reliability </head>
<p n="p7.41">
<s n="s1.2;p7.41">Although the quality of bread produced by bread-makers is generally satisfactory, there are three disadvantages relating to performance and reliability which are common to a number of the bread-makers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.41">The first of these is the problem of unmixed ingredients, especially at the corners, since the mixing paddle does not reach all the way around the base of the pan which results in poorly mixed ingredients. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.41">
<s n="s1.2;p8.41">Secondly, although the resulting bread was savoury in general, it was observed that on some machines the final texture looked wet and underdone, most notably on the Kenwood rapid process. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.41">This is perhaps because the bread-makers usually rush the process of bread-making. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.41">
<s n="s1.2;p9.41">Thirdly, on most machines the positioning of the bread-makers mixing paddle beneath the ingredients/dough means that once the bread is made and removed a hole is left in the middle of the loaf. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.41">This produces an obvious problem when slicing the bread in terms of the shape of some slices. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.41">
<s n="s1.3;p10.41">Finally, with almost all the bread-makers that were evaluated, more so the Kenwood (rapid) and Cookworks, the resulting loaf was darker on the side crust and lighter on the top! </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.41">The crust settings on some of the machines therefore seemed to have produced contrary results. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.41">In most cases, this is probably caused by the heating elements' positioning under the loaf and the low air circulation to the top of the loaf. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.41">
<s n="s1.3;p11.41">These factors in the design of the bread-makers affected the quality of the final product and its appearance. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.41">Moreover, most of the loaves produced were smaller than their supermarket counterparts. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.41">For most of these machines its fair then to say that for the price of the product the loaf of bread produced looks quite small and cheap in appearance. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Value</head>
<p n="p12.41">
<s n="s1.6;p12.41">For the sample of products evaluated there was generally no correlation between the price of the bread makers and their efficiency in terms of energy consumption and noise during operation (see table below). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.41">One might expect the more expensive products to consume the least energy and produce the least noise, and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.41">Although it seems that deficiencies in certain areas of performance and functionality are compromised elsewhere, it was found that there was not necessarily a relationship between price and some important specifications. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.41">For example, while the most expensive product, the Panasonic, consumed relatively low energy and produced less noise it was found that Morphy Richards, one of the least expensive, had lowest consumption of energy whilst also producing only relatively moderate noise during operation. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.41">Another feature was the manufacturing methods for the lids of the bread-makers. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.41">The Panasonic did not include a viewing window whereas all other bread-makers did. </s>
</p>
<table id="BAWE_6103b-tab.002">
<row>
<cell/>
</row>
</table>
<p n="p13.41">
<s n="s1.5;p13.41">For bread-makers in general, the final product is also not as economical in terms of price, time or effort compared with a ready loaf of bread bought from the supermarket. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.41">The typical price of ingredients (500g) is 41p and electricity usage may typically cost about 5p, the total being 46p. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.41">In addition to these there are other costs such as those related to cleaning. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.41">Costs aside, bread-making, although automatic, also requires some time and effort. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.41">In consideration of all such factors it seems that bread-makers are perhaps not for those of us who are seeking a more economical and efficient way of meeting our bread needs. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Ergonomics</head>
<p n="p14.41">
<s n="s1.6;p14.41">Although the controls for the bread-makers tested were generally satisfactory and allow for easy operation, for the Panasonic in particular, a problem arises when the programme is interrupted soon after it has initiated. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.41">For instance, if the user decides to add more water to the ingredients then disrupting the programme requires the machine to reset itself, taking around 10 minutes before manual re-setting is required. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.41">Another drawback relates to the crust settings, where moving the indicator off the medium crust option makes it difficult to reselect this option. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.41">But perhaps more important is the positioning of the control panels on some of the machines tested. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.41">For the Kenwood and Cookworks in particular, the user is required to lean over the lid to view the LCD display. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.41">This is not user friendly at all and potentially hazardous if during operation the user decides to re-position the machine in order to view the display. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.41">
<s n="s1.3;p15.41">There are also problems with the measuring spoons or cups that are provided with most of these machines. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.41">The levels on these measuring cups can be quite difficult to read for two reasons; since the indicators are raised plastic rather than printed in colour (Panasonic) and when the indicators are covered in flour (Morphy Richards). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.41">A related problem is the need to wash the measuring instruments between ingredients. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.41">
<s n="s1.4;p16.41">Furthermore, the most common problem amongst break-makers in terms of ergonomics is perhaps the matter of the paddle. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.41">In most cases the paddle gets stuck inside the loaf especially with wholemeal loafs. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.41">For the Morphy Richards machine in particular the bread almost always gets stuck to the kneading paddle which itself stays stuck to the pan. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.41">In general, as well as being user-unfriendly this feature also disfigures the final product. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Aesthetics</head>
<p n="p17.41">
<s n="s1.4;p17.41">Looks are everything and today's techno-phobic societies judge market products primarily with regard to aesthetics rather than their specifications. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.41">This is the reality of how people think, however illogical. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.41">Most of the bread-makers evaluated would look either big or ugly on the kitchen work surface. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.41">Starting with the Panasonic then: </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6103b-pic.001"/>
<p n="p18.41">
<s n="s1.6;p18.41">The machine is large, white, and although the Panasonic (37x34x36cm) is tall than wide it would take up a fair amount of work surface in any medium sized kitchen. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p18.41">The viewing window is absent on this one, which is exclusive to the Panasonic despite being the most expensive. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p18.41">The inclusion of a window would at least make this one aesthetically more pleasant. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p18.41">Furthermore, the rather rigid box shape coupled with the emphasis on height (rather than width) especially makes the Panasonic look like a mini-washing machine rather than an identifiable bread-maker - and even the washing machine looks better...and has a window! </s>
<s n="s5.6;p18.41">If it doesn't look like a washing machine then it at least looks like a dustbin. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p18.41">This one is clearly not designed for aesthetics then. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6103b-pic.002"/>
<p n="p19.41">
<s n="s1.3;p19.41">The Morphy Richards is nicer looking, sinuous and more evenly shaped than the Panasonic. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.41">The display and control panel is modern and the lid includes a window. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.41">The only criticism of this design is again perhaps its size. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6103b-pic.003"/>
<p n="p20.41">
<s n="s1.3;p20.41">This is the Kenwood, second most expensive, but ugly, perhaps even more so than the Panasonic. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.41">Although it includes a window it is aesthetically very un-modern, rather boxy and wide as opposed to tall. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.41">This one as well as hideous may also require a larger kitchen surface area. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_6103b-pic.004"/>
<p n="p21.41">
<s n="s1.2;p21.41">Although the round window adds modernity to the overall design, the Cookworks bread-maker is not much different looking than the Kenwood so the same criticism would apply. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.41">Again, this one is too square in shape and perhaps does not conform to modern aesthetic design expectations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.41">
<s n="s1.2;p22.41">From the sample evaluated the most common problems with regards to aesthetics then are the sizes, shapes as well as the control panel designs on each bread-maker. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.41">So that as well as affecting aesthetics of the product these factors may also make it difficult for the owner to store the appliance away when not in use. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Safety</head>
<p n="p23.41">
<s n="s1.1;p23.41">Health and safety is the most basic issue when it comes to designing products and customers place their trust in designers who must ensure the safe use of appliances, especially bread-makers which are thermo-electrical devices. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.41">
<s n="s1.4;p24.41">Most of the bread-makers examined had some safety issue. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.41">With regard to the high temperatures involved it was found that all had a temperature sensor and thermal cut out on the walls of heating areas with the exception of the Small Breville. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.41">These are necessary for the safety against the threat of electrical fires. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.41">The same bread-maker also did not include any cooling vents. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.41">
<s n="s1.2;p25.41">It was also found, with the exception of the Small Breville, that most bread pans had deep indentation around the rivet heads. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p25.41">This clearly does not help when cleaning and by implication this results in a hygiene problem. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.41">
<s n="s1.4;p26.41">A safety hazard was also uncovered after dismantling the Cookworks bread-maker which revealed that there was no insulation between the main components and the electrical parts. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.41">Moreover, the vent and window temperatures as measured on the Kenwood were found to be 90 and 70 degrees Celsius, respectively. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.41">Such temperatures are evidently very high, yet on this device in particular there were no visible safety notices. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.41">Such notices must be visible as they provide important guidance and a reminder to the user that they are, in particular, dealing with high temperatures as well as handling liquid substances nearby electrical wires and sockets. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Noise &amp; Vibration </head>
<p n="p27.41">
<s n="s1.4;p27.41">The noise levels for the bread-makers range from 61-71 dBA (see table below). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p27.41">Such noise levels are in the audible region and are typical of a regular human conversation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p27.41">This is sill quite loud. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p27.41">The noise produced by the machines is primarily influenced by the rotations of the paddle-motor and it seems that reduction of the noise level is constrained by the type of mechanism used (i.e. motor and paddle) in design. </s>

<p n="p28.41">
<s n="s1.4;p28.41">Most of these machines also beep very loudly at certain intervals during operation. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.41">In the case of the Morphy Richards bread-maker, there is a loud beep of approximately 10 times when adding ingredients and again at the end. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.41">In small homes this could potentially wake up its owners - earlier than the alarm clock if pre-programmed! </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.41">For the Cookworks machine the buzzer also sets off but for every minute, which is nuisance enough for anyone to reconsider this bread-maker's life in the kitchen. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.41">
<s n="s1.4;p29.41">Unfortunately, little attention was given in our evaluation of these machines regarding their vibration. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.41">It is obvious that the bread-makers will undergo some vibration due to the rotation of the paddle and motor. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.41">Since it was found that the Small Breville was operated by a universal motor of (the highest )ratio 1:145 then this machine would have been most active during operation in terms of vibration(?). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.41">In any case, all of the machines included rubber feet to dampen some of this vibration although the Small Breville may have produced been more unstable than the others. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Type of Motor</head>
<p n="p30.41">
<s n="s1.2;p30.41">There was no consistency among the manufacturers' selection of motors for this application in terms of speed and the type of motors used. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p31.41">The least efficient was that used in the Small Breville, with a ratio of around 1:145(?) characteristic of the universal motor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p32.41">
<s n="s1.1;p32.41">While induction motors are not as cheap as universal motors, for this application they are not as energy intensive, more reliable and allow for more vibration free operation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.41">
<s n="s1.5;p33.41">On the other hand, although the universal motor is cheaper, smaller and lighter it must go very fast to achieve the required torque. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p33.41">This amplifies problems in terms of noise and vibration but also energy consumption. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p33.41">Looking at the figures above it can be seen that energy consumption for the Small Breville is one of the highest. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p33.41">So while it may be cheaper for the manufacturer and knocks down a little of the price for the consumer (being relatively inexpensive), the long term costs may outweigh those of the short term in terms of electricity bills. </s>

<head rend="bold">Use of Materials</head>

<s n="s1.6;p34.41">The most obvious design dilemma arises due to the high temperatures involved in using the bread-makers. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p34.41">Such high temperatures constrain material use in design. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p34.41">Another potential problem was noted for the Small and Large Breville. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p34.41">The manufacturers of these bread-makers have decided to cast the pans which are thicker than pressed pans used for the other machines. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p34.41">While this increases the conductivity of the metal (i.e. thicker) it adds extra weight to the machine. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p35.41">Unfortunately this was revealed to be at the cost of the quality of bread produced. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p35.41">Although the most disappointing machine in this regard was perhaps the Morphy Richards (cheaper machine) it did not function perfectly on the more expensive bread-makers, although better. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p35.41">This is not a surprise since the <hi rend="italic">fastbake</hi> function only speeds up the process of bread making. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.41">
<s n="s1.5;p36.41">Another useful feature, although not of the machines themselves, is the inclusion of recipe guides with most of these bread makers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p36.41">The Panasonic, for instance, includes instructions for making alternative breads including French, Italian, Sandwiches and also cakes. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p36.41">As with most of the machines however, only the recipes presented in the products recipes booklet work and many customers report that other recipes have resulted in disaster. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p36.41">A further relevant point for the Morphy Richards is that the recipes switch from imperial to metric cups for the fast bake. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p36.41">Perhaps these weren't manufactured by the same team! </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.41">
<s n="s1.1;p37.41">There was also a gluten free option for the Panasonic for those who prefer it but again this was only suitable with certain mixes. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p38.41">
<s n="s1.3;p38.41">Our evaluation of bread-makers revealed the many challenges and compromises in the design of these domestic appliances. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.41">The ideal bread-maker is one that fulfils the above criteria's to a maximum degree; this implies perfect functionality, no noise, no safety hazards and no material constraints in design. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.41">In the real world however freedom of design is limited by the many variables determining what is possible and what is not possible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p39.41">
<s n="s1.4;p39.41">For instance, it was found that noise could perhaps not be reduced below a certain level since the mechanisms (motor/paddle) used contributed much to the effect of noise. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p39.41">In order to reduce noise there is a need to control its cause. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p39.41">Manufacturers might be reluctant do so on various grounds including costs but also due to limited design options (i.e. availability of alternative technologies). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p39.41">Similarly, the materials used in manufacture were found to be dependent upon the temperature conditions during operation of the machines, so that only certain materials were suitable in design given the high temperatures involved. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.41">
<s n="s1.5;p40.41">On the other hand there was safety. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p40.41">Surprisingly, it appears that the safety issues discussed in the report did not arise as a result of design constraints but carelessness on the part of the manufacturers. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p40.41">As previously explained, one machine (Small Breville) did not include a thermal cut out point. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p40.41">This seems to be a case of negligence rather than of design limitation. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p40.41">There were other similar cases of safety notices (Kenwood) which can be associated with negligence rather than constraint. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.41">
<s n="s1.1;p41.41">Although there is always room for improvement it seems that the manufacturers of the bread-makers evaluated have achieved their objectives, at least satisfactorily, by balancing all the determining variables within the design constraints into a feasible design solution. </s>
