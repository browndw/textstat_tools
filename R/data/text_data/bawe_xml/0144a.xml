<s n="s1.9;p1.13">The position of women in the period of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has long been described as one of subordination. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.13">Patriarchy, a system that places the authority of men over that of women in both, the public sphere of society, and the private sphere of the household, was evident in both law and custom.<ref target="BAWE_0144a-ftnote.001"/> Women were excluded from government offices, barred from educational establishments and excluded from most professions and trades. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.13">Within the household, husbands had authority over all members and also had control over women's moveable property. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.13">Despite then the position of women appearing seemingly the manifestation of this patriarchal authority, social realities were less extreme then law and tradition would suggest. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.13">Within business, women could conduct trade under legal fiction and were able to find employment where guilds did not operate. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.13">In the household, parenting was conducted as a joint responsibility and many poor families also relied upon a wife's earnings to supplement the husbands. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.13">The extent, however, to which patriarchy was seriously challenged, remains slight. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.13">Although it was perhaps more secure on paper than in practice, by no means were women's positions equal or comparable to those of men. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.13">It is also important to consider the changing position of patriarchy throughout the period and its regional and national differences within Europe, as its security was neither static nor uniform. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.13">Patriarchy was clearly crafted by civic legislation, laws governed potential powers, marriage, property and 'so much more'.<ref target="BAWE_0144a-ftnote.002"/> Common law excluded women specifically from roles as judges, arbitrators, surety, and witnesses in criminal proceedings or to testament.<ref target="BAWE_0144a-ftnote.003"/> Common law and borough custom further governed the legal position of women in trade, preventing them from owning property or making contracts.<ref target="BAWE_0144a-ftnote.004"/> In France, Salic law also prevented women to succeed to the titles or offices in the family and to inherit property.<ref target="BAWE_0144a-ftnote.005"/> In England, property inheritance was governed by the Statute of Wills Act, removing restrictions on the distribution of property by the father to his children, excluding women from the process.<ref target="BAWE_0144a-ftnote.006"/> The role prescribed to women under the law was then one of subordination, placing restrictions upon their positions in both the public and private spheres, patriarchy, therefore, seemingly evident. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.13">The extent to which these laws were enforced and how they operated in reality, however, could be seen challenge these restrictions placed upon women and therefore also the security of patriarchy. </s>

<s n="s6.6;p11.13">Law and custom were then used as means to reinforce the gender hierarchies of the period, placing women back into their traditional positions and restoring their subordination to men. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p13.13">The position of women during early modern society would appear then to fluctuate, witnessing initial increases and then decreases in their positions of status. </s>

<s n="s4.10;p13.13">The effects of the protestant reformation could be seen to have reduced the status and freedoms of women; preventing them from living enclosed lives and subjecting them to the sole vocation of wife and mother. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p13.13">Both law and custom of the period further represented the relative weaknesses concerning the position of women; with restrictions placed upon their property and also the severity of punishments that they were likely to receive. </s>

<s n="s9.10;p13.13">Given that commercialisation and the effects of the expanding economies were seen as a cause which helped to enforce the gender hierarchy, the differing points in which these rises occurred across Europe would suggest that the onset of this patriarchal security varied from state to state. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p13.13">Therefore, although by the end of the period patriarchal authority was secure across Europe, its relative strength and the period in which it arose differed due to the dependence upon the development of state's economies. </s>
