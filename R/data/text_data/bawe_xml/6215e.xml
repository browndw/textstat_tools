<s n="s4.4;p1.18">This project is to investigate whether soil salinity is a determining factor for both <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> population size and area of coverage at a specific location, and which species, <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> or <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> are better adapted to a high level of salt in soil. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.18">For each quadrat, the number of individual <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> were counted, height of some of the plants were measured and percentage of area coverage of both species as well as bare soil area were estimated. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p7.18">The variation of salinity between quadrats appears to be small, however, in quadrat C4, D2 and D3, the two soil samples within the same quadrat seem to have substantially different salt levels and this lead to rather big standard errors of salinity in these quadrats (Graph 1 and Table A2.2 in Appendix 2). </s>

<hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> roughly remains the same (not going up) percentage of coverage from low to high salinity sites, but <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> coverage area decrease as salt level increases and this decrease in coverage area correlate to the decrease number of <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi>. </s>

<p n="p10.18">

<head rend="bold">DISCUSSION</head>
<p n="p13.18">
<s n="s1.5;p13.18">The salt measure method in this experiment is only approximate as other ions would be present in the soil, (e.g. potassium, nitrate, phosphate and sulfate ions) and they could affect the overall conductivity in the soil steeped water and give a higher reading in the conductivity meter than it would be if sodium and chloride were the only ions in the water. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.18">The calculated salinity values could be over estimated. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.18">Also, as there seems to be little variation in salinity between quadrats (Graph 1), but substantial variation in salt level between soil samples within some quadrats (e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.18">C4, D2 and D3), it would be better if more soil samples were taken from each quadrats as getting accurate salinity data is very important for this project for all the results and interpretation of them are based on the salinity values, however, due to constraint in resources (time and equipment), this was not possible. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.18">It also might be better if more than one site was surveyed, as this might lead to bigger variation in soil salinity and more drastic changes in plants population and coverage. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.18">
<s n="s1.6;p14.18">When there were no flowers or florescence on the plants, it was very difficult to distinguish between <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> and misidentification could very easily be made. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.18">Plants that were too small to identify were ignored. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.18">All these could introduce error in the survey data. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.18">Also, percentage of coverage was estimated by eyes and this could be very subjective. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.18">In order to be more consistent, coverage estimation was done by the same person through out the project. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.18">Even counting number of plants could run into problem, sometime it was difficult to tell how many plants were there in a large clump, where did an individual plant start and end? </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.18">
<s n="s1.4;p15.18">There appears to be no correlation between plant number and percentage of area coverage for <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> (see Graph 2 and 3, plant number goes up in high salinity but percentage of coverage goes down). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.18">This could be due to the size of <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> become smaller in high salt level site. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.18">Which data, plant number or percentage of area coverage, to use as an indication of population changes can be difficult to decide. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.18">As in this case, they can give a very different picture. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.18">
<s n="s1.3;p16.18">
<hi rend="italic">t</hi>-test results show there appears to be no significant different in number of plant or area of coverage between high salinity site and low salinity site for <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi>, despite there seem to be an increase in number of plant in high salt level area (Graph 2). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.18">This apparent contradiction could be due to high variation in the number of <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> plants between quadrats and this gives a bigger spread in the standard error and lead to higher P-values in the <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-test. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.18">However, caution must be taken for all the <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-test results, as the categorized of quadrats into high or low salt levels is based on salinity data of each quadrat and we saw that these salinity values are subjected to a lot of possible error (see Graph 1). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.18">
<s n="s1.2;p17.18">Moisture content in the soil could be another factor that determine which species is more dominant in a particular area. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.18">Number of <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> seems to increase with moisture content in soil (Graph 5), however, this increase in population does not seem to reflect in the percentage of area coverage (Graph 6). </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.18">
<s n="s1.3;p18.18">To conclude, <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> seem to be less salt tolerance and their population (in term of plant number or area coverage) seem to be affected more by salt level in soil than <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.18">Salt could be the determining factor for <hi rend="italic">M. tenacissima</hi> distribution in a site. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.18">However, salt level seems to have little effect on <hi rend="italic">L. spartum</hi> and other soil factors may be the determining factor for their distribution. </s>
