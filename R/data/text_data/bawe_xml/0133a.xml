<s n="s3.3;p1.12">Lord Steyn in laying out his reasoning took into account Parliament's intention, importance of retention of fingerprints and DNA samples and if retention in reality interfered with a person's right under articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 as set out in Schedule 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998. </s>

<head rend="underlined italic">Reasoning behind majority opinion:</head>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.4;p3.12">Lord Steyn saw the important role retention of fingerprints and DNA samples played in detection and prevention of crime, in ruling out the innocent in an investigation and in correction of miscarriages of justice. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.12">To illustrate his point he took the example of case 'I' in which the offender would have escaped if it were not for the wrongly retained DNA sample. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.1;p4.12">The parliament intended retention of samples to prevent the guilty from being acquitted and in preventing and detection of crimes, which was clear through the explanatory notes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.7;p5.12">One of the main questions before the House of Lords was whether retention interfered with an individual's rights under articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p5.12">The judge reasoned that retention of DNA samples and fingerprints help widen the database so that more matches can be made ensuring speedier apprehension of criminals and a higher degree of justice meted out. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p5.12">He referred to what the Commission had to say about the matter, which was that it was 'open to question'<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.002"/>, and Dr Bramley's statement that the database was rigorously protected and had strong safeguards to prevent any misuse. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p5.12">Levenson J said that retention has no impact on a person's private life as an untutored eye cannot recognize a DNA sample and relate it to a person. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p5.12">To make a match an experienced professional or/and sophisticated instruments are needed. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p5.12">The database just contains the sample and the information of the person to who it belongs and not any physical characteristics or any medical information<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.003"/>. </s>

</note>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.3;p6.12">Another point to be mentioned is that Lord Steyn did not believe that the UK's cultural traditions played any part in deciding whether retention of samples interfered with article 8(1) of the convention unlike the judges in the Court of Appeal. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.12">He believed that the convention is an 'international instrument'<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.004"/> and must be applicable in all member states uniformly. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.12">On the appellants claim that they feared misuse in the future in light of more discoveries Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood said that as no such abuse is presently threatened the court will address the issue when the time comes<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.005"/>. </s>

<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.2;p7.12">Lord Steyn thus concluded that retention did not interfere with article 8(1) of the convention and even if it did it is very 'modest' and justified under article 8(2). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.12">In the words of Sedley J, "the purpose of retention - prevention of crime and the protection of the right of others to be free from crime - are foursquare within art 8(2), and retention is provided for by law."<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.006"/> </s>

</note>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.2;p8.12">As for retention amounting to discrimination under article 14 of the convention the judge said that the difference in treatment between the appellants and those who had not been required to provide samples was not on one of the proscribed grounds in article 14 and that it fell out of the definition of 'other status'<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.12">It was, infact, based on a historical fact of taking the samples. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.12;p9.12">The second main question was that of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire's policy of retaining all samples, except in exceptional cases, of acquitted individuals in all cases. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p9.12">The appellants claimed that to be incompatible with the fundamental rights of individuals. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p9.12">They said that it created a suspicion in respect to those acquitted. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p9.12">Lord Steyn disagreed. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p9.12">He established that without a sample from the crime scene a match could not be made. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p9.12">The retained samples would not be made public. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p9.12">A person cannot be identified to an untutored eye just by looking at the samples on the database so any interference by retention is minimal. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p9.12">Retention is just to widen the database and help aid the law<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p9.12">As Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood said that he could not understand as to why anyone would object to the retention of his or her samples unless it is to minimize the risk of getting caught in the future<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p9.12">Also for the Chief Constable to decide on his discretion (on a case to case basis) whether the person is free of any 'taint of suspicion'<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.010"/> is impractical. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p9.12">It will just lead to disputes and be discriminating. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p9.12">Others whose samples have been retained would ask (rightly so) why they are being treated guilty when the court found them not so<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.011"/>. </s>

<s n="s8.11;p11.12">The Baroness said that storing such information means that someone has seen it and knows of it. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.013"/> and <hi rend="italic"> Friedl v Austria</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.014"/> where in the former it was held that storage of private information and its release without been given a chance to challenge it is an interference with the right to privacy. </s>
