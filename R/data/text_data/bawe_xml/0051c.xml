<p>The energy spectra for gamma-ray sources were analysed to identify the key features of the spectrum and the energy levels at which they appeared. The Poisson nature of radioactive emission was proven via calculating <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.001"/> statistically and experimentally:</p>
<p>The mean <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.002"/> and the 2 values for <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.003"/> were found:</p>
<p>
<formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.004"/>, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.005"/>, <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.006"/>
</p>
<p>These 2 <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.007"/> values are in agreement to within 1%</p>
<p>Features of the detector were calculated that affect the shape of the spectrum:</p>
<p>Relative efficiency= <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.008"/>

<p>Energy resolution= <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.009"/>

<p> Thickness of scintillator crystal <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0051c-form.011"/>

<p>By comparison of the energy levels of the key features, Source A was identified as Sodium-22 and Source B was found to be Cobalt-60. Two values for the attenuation coefficient of lead (Pb) were found using these two sources:</p>
