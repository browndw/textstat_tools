<s n="s1.5;p1.11">The history of English law is long standing and well established. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.11">As stated in Keeton's (1984:7) book, 'the doctrine of precedent inherently brings legal history to bear upon current judicial decisions.' </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.11">Due to the distinctive nature of precedents, the specificity of cases had been coloured by its uniqueness and independence. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.11">Every verdict in individual cases had imposed a remarkable influence on the development of the law of tort. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.11">Many reasoning as well as rulings had even been extended into modern days. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.7;p2.11">According to Keeton's (1984) investigation, in early nineteenth century, the common practice of the society was politically incorrect. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.11">The concern over how to identify the problem of proximity had created a loud noise. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.11">Meanwhile, the whole system was still at embryo stage. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.11">Some might argue that when goods were sold from the manufacturer to distributors, those products were then expected to be resold to other retailers and eventually reaching the hands of consumers. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.11">Because of the unknown size of the public being involved behind, the society tended not to burden the manufacturers and sellers with too much pressure. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.11">Hence, it was generally accepted that the responsibility should not be passed onto their shoulders. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.11">Yet, a gleam of hope shined in this apparently desperate situation, lightened the darkness. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.11">
<s n="s1.7;p3.11">Originally, in <hi rend="italic"> Heaven v.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.11">
<hi rend="italic">Pender</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0142a-ftnote.001"/>, the concept of negligence was not approved by Cotton and Bowen L.JJ.<ref target="BAWE_0142a-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.11">After years and years of criticism, the importance of the duty of care had been stressed. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.11">And in law's term, a number of previous judges had tried to work out a formula to define the duty of care. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.11">Firstly, Brett M.R. provided a statement with a relatively wide meaning. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.11">He, became Lord Esher in later time, amended his idea by saying it in a less vague way. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.11">Then with Lords Atkin, Thankerton and Macmillan coming next, their comments given those days had inaugurated a new era in law of negligence. </s>

<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Only if physical harm was caused, the ground for accounting negligence was possibly formed. </s>

<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.11;p4.11">At that time, the relevant law can be applied purely relied on the law of contract. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.11">It covered a very limited area as the linkage was being built up in between buyers and sellers only which had made it more difficult to make the manufacturer of defective products liable to third parties. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.11">The problem then came up, Mrs. Donoghue did not purchase the ginger beer in person (Adams, 2003). </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.11">In this case, the right of making a claim was restricted to Mrs. Donoghue's friend (buyer) only. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.11">But, her friend did not suffer much. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.11">So, even if she had decided to engage in a lawsuit, the compensation could have been a pretty small amount which was insufficient to recover Mrs. Donoghue's harm, her physical illness and mental impact. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.11">However, as a third person, the bargaining counter of Mrs. Donoghue is very weak since she had no direct relationship with the seller. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.11">Moreover, the seller is just one of the retailers. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.11">To make it meaningful, the plaintiff had made up her mind to sue Stevenson, the manufacturer. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.11">And the final outcome had written a new page in tort law and case law. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p4.11">The results boosted popular morale and encouraged same type of cases being put to court. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.9;p5.11">The past experience shadowed a lot on tort law. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.11">It was always difficult to fit in several standard frameworks. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.11">In order to raise a practical claim, the plaintiff would need to look for particular pattern to follow under the spirit of common law. </s>

<hi rend="italic">Stevenson</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0142a-ftnote.003"/> had examined the association in between a general public sentiment of wrongdoing and its responsibility. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.11">It had shown that the liability for negligence did exist, successfully opposing the general rule<ref target="BAWE_0142a-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.11">Furthermore, the interpretation of Lord Macmillan had emphasized on the last few lines, "The grounds of action may be as various and manifold as human errancy; and the conception of legal responsibility may develop in adaptation to altering social conditions and standards. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p6.11">On the other hand, the dictum made by Lord Atkin had put forward a relatively concrete guideline for the posterity to follow. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p6.11">This valuable notion introduced was the "neighbour" principle. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p6.11">"The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my meighbour? </s>

<s n="s8.10;p6.11">Some sort of duty of care had been recognized to an outsider with whom it had no contract at all. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p6.11">It is also a fateful event to determine that a manufacturer did owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumer, not just buyers and sellers. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p6.11">Other than evidently outlined the method should be adopted to define the vicinity or proximity within reasonable range, the decision could never make it any clearer that the existing precedents was no longer an obstacle in developing the tort of negligence. </s>

<s n="s7.8;p7.11">In addition, the opinions mentioned above and by Lord Macmillan<ref target="BAWE_0142a-ftnote.007"/> had turned into an extremely strong persuasive precedent. </s>
