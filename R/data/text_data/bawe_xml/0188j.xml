<s n="s1.2;p82.87">The results of the experiments have shown many important factors that affect the kinetics of the hydrolysis of crystal violet. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p82.87">Such as the order of reaction with respect to OH- and CV are both first, but the effect of adding an inert salt to the solution proved that there is perhaps a secondary pathway of the reaction taking place also- which is also eluded to in [5]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p83.87">
<s n="s1.3;p83.87">The solvent effects were unexpected; methanol especially exhibiting second order reaction kinetics. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p83.87">Thus a competing nucleophilic attack, rather than a solvent effect- and as such a poor illustrator of the effects of solvent on the reaction kinetics. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p83.87">However the acetone results were good, and in line with literature data- and implying that the acetone stabilises the carbocation more readily than water (increase in rate), but the OH- nucleophile has more difficulty displacing the acetone due to the stronger Van der Waals interaction occurring between CV and acetone and this is seen in a larger activation energy (compared to water solvent). </s>
</p>
<p n="p84.87">
<s n="s1.3;p84.87">The accuracy obtained here when compared (to the few experimental results available), shows that for a limited undergraduate set up the results are quite good. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p84.87">Ideally the reaction would be carried out in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, and all solvents properly degassed before used as well as crystal violet solid being prepared from scratch and re-crystallised before being made into a solution to increase purity of reagents. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p84.87">Alongside all experiments being repeated- to decrease the errors, however this would require more time than the three days provided. </s>
</p>
<p n="p85.87">
<s n="s1.3;p85.87">For the ionic salt effect, more results would need to be obtained to be more conclusive about another reaction pathway; especially at very low ionic strength. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p85.87">Some of the higher ionic strength experiments conducted here were probably out of the Debye-Hückel limiting laws and as such are unreliable. </s>

</p>
<p n="p86.87">
<s n="s1.1;p86.87">For the solvents, a wider range of solvents could be used to investigate solvent effects, however caution has to be applied when choosing a solvent; since methanol was a competing nucleophile to hydroxide and change the whole kinetics of the situation. </s>
