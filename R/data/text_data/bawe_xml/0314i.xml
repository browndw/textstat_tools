<s n="s1.10;p1.8">The Mexican Revolution of 1911 and the proceeding revolutionary decade was an important political period in the history of Mexico absorbing a multiplicity of ideological stances. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p1.8">Relations with the United States of America and the Soviet Union are amongst the factors that built the leftist strand of the revolution as one of its distinct features. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.8">Diplomacy with the Unites States was important in the altering of the character of the revolutionary period and shows the attitude the U.S.A had toward Mexico. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.8">The dynamics of this relationship, and apparent need to cooperate with the United States would be instrumental in the behaviour of the key players in Mexico, causing both the strengthening of leftist sentiment and the later compromise of these leftist principles. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.8">The U.S.A.'s strong leftist bohemian community and their relations with the Mexican people were paramount in the shaping of the Revolution's leftist character. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.8">Key figures helped rectify the perception of Mexico in the U.S and worked actively in Mexico in the encouragement of leftist ideology. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.8">The strained and unclear relationship between the Soviet Union and Mexico illustrates the competing ideologies present in the Mexican Revolution. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.8">The leftist strand resulted in the Soviet Union being considered an exemplar to Mexico whilst other views would result in a tenuous diplomatic relationship between Russia and Mexico. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.8">These relations would also affect relations with the U.S, as Spenser summarises in the title of her latest book, <hi rend="italic">The Impossible Triangle</hi>. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p1.8">Whilst relations with these two countries were important, key figures within Mexico and structural considerations are important in our understanding of how this leftist character formed as well. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.7;p2.8">On the eve of the revolution in 1911 other factors were important to the distinctive leftist character which shaped the revolution's initial stages. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.8">Zapista, Villa, Carrillo Puerto and other individuals where especially significant in this process. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.8">The impact of these characters is illustrated on the affect they had on each other. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.8">Joseph remarks that 'Carrillo was influenced by the anti capitalist doctrine that pervaded <hi rend="italic">Zapatismo</hi> in 1914-1915'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.001"/> Roy remarks on the presence of Zapata in that 'even beyond the frontiers of Mexico (he) was hailed as the revolutionary champion of the freedom of the Mexican people' and that within Mexico there was 'a godly number of idealist intellectuals, not only of advanced liberal views, some of them were professional socialist, and a few anarchists'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.002"/> Yucatán under Felipe Carrillo Puerto provides another good instance of the leftist ideology forming from within the country. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.8">Joseph describes his shrewd activity noting that he was a 'socialist committed to profound structural change, he remained adept at working through the maze of formal and informal political networks'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.003"/> Economic structural problems and political problems especially, Diaz's ruthlessness fuelled the grievances the intelligentsia, peasants and workers had against the Diaz regime resulting in left wing ideas, especially around meeting the demand of peasants and working class<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.8">The demand for agrarian reform was a pressing structural complaint of the people and the resulting demands immediately lend to the leftist shape of the revolution.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.005"/> The Constitution of 1917 can be seen as the culmination of these demands and representing the leftist success of the revolution as it 'legalized principles of social justice, such as common ownership'<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.8">The culmination can be seen in that on the establishment of the 1917 Constitution Britton remarks that the Unites States feared the state would remake the economy to favour the disadvantaged. <ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<s n="s4.9;p3.8">Britton comments on Woodrow Wilson's 'hope of projecting a liberal capitalist ideology into the Mexican polity'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.008"/> This staunch political stance was important in the leftist shape the revolution was to take in the early days as the United States attitude was used to contrast with that of Mexico strengthening the resolve of the left in Mexico and their drive to shape the country in this manner. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.8">Historically, the Mexican's can, in the nineteenth century, been seen to have become tired of U.S. commercialism, dominance and influence which had started to grow rapidly in Mexico. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.8">Hart accredits 'the revolution as the product of reaction by peasants, urban and industrial workers, the petite bourgeois and provincial elites against forging economic intrusion during the <hi rend="italic">Porfiriato</hi>'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.009"/> Britton records this contrast explicitly 'in Mexico the leaders of the movement came to see him [,Wilson,] as their enemy'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.010"/> The 1917 Constitution arguably was a culmination of resentment to the U.S. expressing Nationalist and leftist feeling. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.8">For instance, 'Article 123 provided the legal basis for an advanced labour code that would eventually pose problems for U.S. corporations operating in Mexico'<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.8">However, in the latter part of the decade Obregon prioritised his diplomatic relationship with the United States and in order to maintain good relations, compromised on the leftist ideology that the country had been following. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.8">Obregon wanted to 'ensure the flow of foreign capital to Mexico with the objective of being able to carry out a domestic and foreign policy without U.S. interference'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.012"/> The inextricable economic relationship between the United States and Mexico can therefore be seen to have shaped the later character of the revolutionary period and to have pacified the extreme leftist sentiment that was attempting to prevail. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p4.8">These political pilgrims were a fundamental aspect of the relationship between the United States and Mexico. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.8">For example, 'Baels joined other leftists from the United States in the denunciation of business values, middle class materialism and the myopia sense of well being'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.013"/> Their publications in the United States were instrumental in the way Mexico was perceived by the United States public, and important in the promotion of the left cause in Mexico to the United States audience<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.014"/>. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p4.8">Yet whilst illustrative of this, both instances show the presence of leftist sentiment in the Mexican Revolution. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.8">Turner believed that 'Carranza's partially revolutionary, partially bourgeois platform was the best that Mexico could expect under the pressures of internal disorder and external intervention' whilst 'Reed's combination of journalism and mythmaking in <hi rend="italic">Ten Days that Shook the World</hi> convinced many radicals and some liberals that the Communist millennium was near'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.015"/> Bael's provides an excellent example of how the revolution was academically promoted in the U.S. by this community. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.8">Bael's continued objective reporting, loyalty to the leftist ideology and needs of Mexican workers and enthusiasm for what the revolution could bring to Mexico, provides an outstanding illustration of how these writers were instrumental in the promotion of the leftist shape of the revolution. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.8">Bael's reporting was one amongst many pieces that helped bridge the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and the perception the United States public had of Mexico. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p6.8">The existence of a clear leftist stance as part of the character of the Revolution is shown in that some figures in Mexico strongly felt that relations with the Soviet Union should be established and that the Soviet Union provided an important exemplar to Mexico. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.8">For example, De Negri argued 'that it is of great importance for our government to study the tendencies of Soviet Russia's administrators because of the sympathy it had displayed in our government'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.020"/> However, in the initial phases it was the Soviet Union that was to approach Mexico in the establishment of a relationship showing the inexistence of a clear socialist stance. </s>

<s n="s7.7;p6.8">Obregon's government provides an interesting example as the stance he seemingly was taken was flexible, and he would vary it depending on the current political context, relations with the Soviet Union arguably can be seen as a possible short term rather than a long term consideration, with the U.S. investment being his key priority. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p8.8">The Unites States staunch right wing position clearly affected the relationship between the Mexico and the Soviet Union, and arguably if Mexico had not been so dependent on the United States for investment a stronger relationship with the Soviet Union may have formed. </s>
