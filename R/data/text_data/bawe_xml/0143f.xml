<s n="s4.7;p1.23">The remedies available through judicial review are limited to the private law remedies of an injunction, a declaration, or damages, added to by the prerogative orders of a quashing order, a mandatory order or a prohibiting order<ref target="BAWE_0143f-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.23">All judicial review remedies are utterly discretionary, leading to a certain amount of indeterminacy within the area. </s>

<head rend="bold">CONCLUDING REMARKS. </head>
<p n="p18.23">
<s n="s1.1;p18.23">Though this exploration of the possible routes X, Y and Z could take has led to many possible conclusions, there are no certainties due to the vague and unpredictable nature of judicial review. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.23">
<s n="s1.3;p19.23">The first hurdle of the process, that of gaining leave for judicial review, from the evidence provided, would be the stumbling block for student X, as his medical evidence is not legally required to ensure his hearing is fair. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.23">He would also find it incredibly difficult to prove that the policy ABC College had adopted was so unreasonable that no other school would have considered it. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p19.23">His proportionality argument would, by the English courts, probably be denied time, due to their reluctance to include it into our judicial review procedure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.23">
<s n="s1.2;p20.23">Student Y in all probability has a higher chance of gaining leave for review, as her case could quite easily be proven to violate the right to a fair hearing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p20.23">If she were to fail at this stage, Y could possibly take her case to the ECHR, and claim a violation of her Article 6(1) right to a fair trial by an unbiased panel. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.23">
<s n="s1.1;p21.23">Student Z may find it more difficult to get leave for review than student Y, because it would be down to the discretion of the judge in the Administrative Court as to whether the consideration of Z's grades, and the purpose of lowering school expenditure were irrelevant and improper enough respectively, to give Z the opportunity to have his decision judicially reviewed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.23">
<s n="s1.2;p22.23">In regard to the possible remedies the students could claim, I feel that all three pupils could apply for quashing orders in relation to the decisions against them, and then a second hearing in front of an unbiased panel, taking into account no irrelevant considerations, and hearing all germane evidence. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.23">It is improbable that the court would order ABC College to alter its drug-testing policy, as the policy does not go against the intentions of Parliament, and it is also commonly stated that local authorities are empowered to do <hi rend="italic"> "...anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions"</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0143f-ftnote.027"/>. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">
<hi rend="italic">Administrative Law</hi> Emery, C. At Chapter 3, page 80. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p23.23">
<s n="s1.4;p23.23">Had the students appealed to a Local Authority board, and then applied for judicial review of this secondary decision, it is likely that their chances of granting leave would be increased. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.23">This would be because, although judges dislike using the 'floodgates' argument, (as they say that any case meritorious of review should be granted it), them granting review to three disgruntled schoolchildren after a school-panel decision, may indeed cause an influx of similar applications. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.23">If the children went through a local authority appeal before their applications however, the courts may consider themselves as the pupils' last resort to be given a just hearing. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.23">It would consequently be in the best interests of X, Y and Z to attempt to have their cases heard at local authority level before trying for judicial review. </s>
