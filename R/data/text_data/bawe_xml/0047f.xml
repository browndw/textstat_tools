<head>Analysis of history</head>
<p n="p12.48">
<s n="s1.4;p12.48">There are several salient features of the history which indicate infective endocarditis (IE) as the most likely cause for Mr <name type="other"/>'s symptoms. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.48">Although the majority of his symptoms (i.e. malaise, lethargy, rigors and anaemia) are non-specific, the fact that he has a history of cardiac disease and underwent a dental procedure just prior to the onset of symptoms should raise suspicion of IE. In addition, the onset of loin pain may be due to splenomegaly or immune-complex deposition which is commonly seen in IE. Given his current drug regime and history of heart disease, Mr <name type="other"/> is obviously suffering from a minor degree of heart failure (New York classification I). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.48">Fortunately however there was nothing to suggest that this had been exacerbated by the recent events, for example as a result of valve destruction. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.48">There was also nothing to suggest the occurrence of an infarction (e.g. arterial, pulmonary, coronary or cerebral) as a result of vegetation emboli. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.48">
<s n="s1.5;p13.48">When considering differential diagnoses at this stage, there are numerous conditions which could explain his main symptoms of malaise, lethargy and rigors and the association with a dental procedure may just be incidental. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p13.48">Following his recent hospital admission, anaemia would have to be a possible reason, especially if no underlying cause was previously determined. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p13.48">Secondly, despite the lack of pyrexia and cough, a LRTI may present in this way and given his bronchiectasis, Mr <name type="other"/> would have an increased susceptibility to such infections. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p13.48">Elderly patients are also prone to UTI's which can often present with non-specific systemic symptoms. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p13.48">Other conditions such as SLE, sickle cell disease and atrial myxoma (primary cardiac tumour) can also mimic IE. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.48">
<s n="s1.1;p14.48">During the physical examination it would be necessary to assess the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems as well as searching for more specific clinical signs which indicate IE. Important clinical signs of IE include the following: </s>
