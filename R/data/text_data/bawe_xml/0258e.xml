<s n="s1.4;p2.41">The evaluation of system depends upon many factors such as memory load, time, and accuracy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.41">The expert user can tolerate a much higher memory load with apparent less prompting which might not be the case with general user. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.41">Indeed, evidence indicates that a system design that works well for the inexperienced user can be slow, crude for the expert. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.41">Hence there is a limitation on the evaluation done by expert is because of different level of understanding and requirement in comparison with general evaluation. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p4.41">The programmer model doesn't hold extra buttons .The system is <hi rend="bold">compact</hi> and provides <hi rend="bold">enough information</hi> for the user to operate things like changing the temperature or time. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.41">
<s n="s1.1;p5.41">The <hi rend="bold">information provider button</hi> is also one of the strength of the existing programmer, which is important for any model, as user might need information at any point during operating the device. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.41">
<s n="s1.1;p6.41">The model shows good <hi rend="bold">mapping</hi> at many points in the design as use of water tap to show water and bag for holiday are good examples to give user the quick idea for the button use. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.41">
<s n="s1.1;p11.41">The <hi rend="bold">placement</hi> of <hi rend="bold">buttons/switches</hi> on the model is not very well done, as the buttons for the hot water and the hot water slider should be placed closed to each other in order to show relationship between them and that might reduce the short term memory load of the user. </s>
