</head>
<p n="p20.28">
<s n="s1.5;p20.28">graph (fig.2) shows that for Diesel fuel the thermal efficiency rose as the load increased from 0 to around 15N. From 15N the thermal efficiency rose only slightly to a peak at around 36 Newton's load. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p20.28">The engine therefore would have been at its most thermally efficient at this load and temperature. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p20.28">From 36 to 50 Newton's load the thermal efficiency decreased, as more of the energy in the fuel was lost as heat as the engine became too hot. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p20.28">Biodiesel followed a similar trend to Diesel but burnt at a higher temperature at every load and so was overall less thermally efficient. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p20.28">Biodiesel appeared most thermally efficient at 25 Newton's load, with thermal efficiency tailing off rapidly above this load. </s>

</head>
<p n="p21.28">
<s n="s1.3;p21.28">graph (fig.3) shows that for both fuels as the load increased to approx 7 Newton's, the brake thermal efficiency increased at similar rates. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.28">Above 7 Newton's load however, both fuels continued to increase brake thermal efficiency but at a lesser rate with Diesel performing better overall Compared to Biodiesel. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.28">Both fuels seemed to give maximum brake thermal efficiencies at around 360-380 N m-2 of Brake Mean Effective Pressure, above which their brake thermal efficiencies either dropped significantly (Biodiesel) or remained constant (Diesel). </s>

<head rend="underlined">Fuel Consumption </head>
<p n="p24.28">
<s n="s1.2;p24.28">rates for Biodiesel were around 10% higher than Diesel possibly due to the fact that Vegetable oils have a lower cetane number (40) compared to Diesel (45-50) and overall lower energy density of 37-40 MJ kg-1 compared to 45.9 MJ kg-1 for Diesel. </s>
