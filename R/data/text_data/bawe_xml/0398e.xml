<s n="s1.2;p33.48">Prior to the 1994 Act, juries were already taking a dim view of silence<ref target="BAWE_0398e-ftnote.070"/> and although the judge would direct that nothing should be inferred from the defendant's silence, "<hi rend="italic">the jury would still wonder why the defendant gave a 'no comment' interview</hi>"<ref target="BAWE_0398e-ftnote.071"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p33.48">Due to the secrecy of jury deliberations it is impossible to know the true extent of the affect of silence on the jury either before or after the CJPOA. Many legal professionals and commentators believe, however, that juries have always drawn adverse inferences from what they believed to be an unjustified silence and they continue to do so today.<ref target="BAWE_0398e-ftnote.072"/> This suggests that section 34 has had a negligible impact on the jury. </s>
