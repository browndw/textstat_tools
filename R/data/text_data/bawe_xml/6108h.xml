<s n="s1.3;p1.38">A modern networked economy brings with it inherent risks to the security and stability of that economy, much as any other before the advent of the Internet has. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.38">But the world of E-Enterprise presents a new and unseen threat - that of the hacker. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.38">Whether of malicious intent or otherwise, attempts to break the security of high-profile web sites and E-Businesses are rife, and it is both the duty and responsibility of an organisation to protect against them. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p2.38">This essay examines the electronic threats to one of the United Kingdom's biggest electronic retailers - Amazon.co.uk - using a number of published techniques to model these threats, their potential impacts, and proposes measures for preventing them or limiting the damage they cause. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.38">Amazon.co.uk has achieved almost unrivalled success as a purely-online retailer. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.38">The core value in Amazon's business is not the products that they sell - though these do generate a substantial revenue, but in the Marketplace (which allows users to buy and sell from each other) and, crucially, the licensing of Amazon's technical architecture and model to other organisations. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.38">It is the success of Amazon's architecture and model that has created huge value in others wishing to use it to sell their own products. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p4.38">The diagram below represents a simplified view of the Amazon.co.uk system, from a networking point of view. </s>

<p n="p6.38">
<s n="s1.1;p6.38">The first step in examining the threats to the Amazon.co.uk web site is to observe and analyse its behaviour and interactions with the user - the first place a hacker or inquisitive person will look for potential holes in the interface that can be exploited. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.38">
<s n="s1.2;p7.38">Through usage of the Amazon.co.uk website, and a full examination of its functionality, the core components providing that functionality can be deduced. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p8.38">Throughout the website the user has the ability to browse for a product by clicking on the tabs on the navigation bar to change product type (books, electronics, videos etc), and further narrow the enquiry through category (such as genre) displayed on the left-hand navigation area. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p9.38">The ability is also provided to search within a particular 'shop' (section - see above) such as DVDs, CDs, or books, and a 'Power Search' option is also provided for books, allowing the user to specify many other criteria such as publication date or ISBN number. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p19.38">In addition, where another user of Amazon has bought the same product(s) as the user, other items they purchased in the same transaction are often listed on this front page. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p19.38">This clever data mining often achieves the goal of suggesting to the user products that another user with similar interests has bought, aiming to boots sales. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p19.38">By navigating to the more detailed 'Your Store' section, users are presented with a list of recommendations that can be ranked - each product can be stricken-off as already owned or 'not interested', and given up to five stars indicating the relevance/interest to the user of that particular recommendation. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p19.38">This scoring is updated in the database and new, more suitable recommendations are selected from the products based on the improved criteria and displayed instantly to the user. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p19.38">Users can also write reviews for products they have purchased in the past to inform others interested in a particular product - each review, along with associated ranking and credited by the username of the reviewer, is stored in the database cluster and appended to the product information page. </s>

<item>2 Secure database access policy, lowest-possible privileges</item>

<item>4 Router &amp; firewall software to detect and combat dropped SYN (TCP Synchronise) packets and detect/filter traffic</item>
<item>Large bandwidth and web server redundancy to 'soak up' attacks</item>

<item>6 Effective permissions on web server, high-strength password policy for router, firewall, and Linux system users</item>
<item>7 Enforcement of strong password policy for customer accounts, encrypted credit card details, effective security policies (such as only delivering ordered goods to credit card registered address)</item>
<item>8 Proper policies for ensuring customer can differentiate genuine website (site certificate authorities), authentication through third-party checking authorities with encrypted connections</item>
<item>9 Closing ALL unnecessary ports, patching all servers to latest version regularly, including open ports on database servers</item>
