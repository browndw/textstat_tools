<p n="p38.45">
<s n="s1.2;p38.45">A drawback to the rinne's and weber's test according to <hi rend="italic">Mulrow,</hi> 1991, is that "because the tuning fork test evaluates hearing at a single low frequency, it is not appropriate for most elderly patients. </s>

<p n="p42.45">
<s n="s1.3;p42.45">Routine clinical examination has a place, but mainly in the detection of ear infections and cerumen via an otoscope. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p42.45">The tuning fork tests will give an immediate indication as to whether there is a hearing deficit present; however these tests are crude and can only be applied if the patient can understand and follow a command. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p42.45">It has been highlighted that they are of little use in elderly patients due to the loss of ability, to hear high frequencies as we age. </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.45">
<s n="s1.5;p43.45">The whispered speech test has advantages in that it is cheap, quick and can be performed on mass in the community by a range of health professionals. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p43.45">I.e. health visitors. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p43.45">This makes it a convenient test for screening purposes. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p43.45">However its major disadvantage is that again the patient needs to be able to understand a command and respond, which is only possible in children above approximately 3 years old. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p43.45">Another problem is standardising this test due to the loudness of the whisper. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.45">
<s n="s1.3;p44.45">The pure tone audiometry is probably the gold standard test; it is the most accurate at determining the type and extent of hearing loss. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p44.45">Its disadvantage is that it needs to be carried out in a specialised department by a technician. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p44.45">This renders it ineffective for community screening. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.45">
<s n="s1.2;p45.45">Finally the two tests which can be used in neonates and patients which cannot respond to a command are otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem evoked response. </s>
