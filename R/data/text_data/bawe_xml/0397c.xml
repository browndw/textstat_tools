<p n="p23.31">
<s n="s1.3;p23.31">Shrouded in rhetoric about maximum disclosure, compliance with the disclosure regime is argued to be in the defendant's best interests. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.31">Nonetheless, it was felt necessary to compel defence disclosure under s5 by making provision for adverse inferences to be drawn under s11 CPIA. The grounds for such inferences are enumerated in s11(6), and on the face of it the pitfalls of defence disclosure seem vast. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.31">This may go some way to explaining the fact that where the defendant may provide a defence statement under s6, he does not chose to do so<ref target="BAWE_0397c-ftnote.071"/> considering that he will be equally subject to the possibility of adverse inferences. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p24.31">The use of s6E CPIA to create the rebuttable presumption that the defence statement was issued with the authority of the accused does little to protect the defendant from inferences where the statement was issued late. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.31">In these circumstances it is difficult to determine the precise nature of the appropriate inference to be drawn<ref target="BAWE_0397c-ftnote.073"/>, and thus it is difficult not to create undue prejudice against the defendant. </s>

<p n="p26.31">
<s n="s1.4;p26.31">It would be a discredit to the criminal justice system to state that the disclosure rules wholly undermine the defendant's right to a fair trial, but the obligations of defence disclosure remain questionable. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p26.31">Weakness also lies in the failure to protect the defendant against abuse of process; the provisions leave ample scope for the police to hide information should they wish to do so<ref target="BAWE_0397c-ftnote.076"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p26.31">If maximum disclosure is to be embraced as the government suggests, then it may in fact be more appropriate to consider an investigative system of justice. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p26.31">While it remains adversarial, the state must recognise the inherent imbalance and realise that justice is best achieve through adequate protection of the defence. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Research Memorandum </head>
<p n="p27.31">
<s n="s1.5;p27.31">My research started by considering the opportunities for empirical research. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.31">I relied on a previously established working relationship with a WPC at a police station near my home town, as well as getting in touch with a personal contact who sits as a Magistrate at Norwich Magistrates' Court. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.31">For background on issues before the court, I spent a day in the Magistrates' Court, observing a variety of cases which involved procedural matters. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.31">What soon became apparent was the use of the court for timetabling matters, and the delays that were inherent in the system as a result of the poor availability of evidence, and general difficulties with the preparation for a hearing. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.31">On this basis I decided to focus my essay on disclosure. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.31">
<s n="s1.3;p28.31">After re-reading lecture notes, I used the online library resources to search for reported cases which echoed my concerns with the disclosure regime. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p28.31">From that point, it was then possible to find case notes as well as journal articles on the recent legislative reforms. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p28.31">Generally my research relied on a research trail using sources cited in other articles. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.31">
<s n="s1.2;p29.31">A search of <name type="university"/> Library provided several books on evidence in the criminal process, as well as one specifically on disclosure. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.31">I was fortunate to be able to use the library at the University of East Anglia to source relevant books that were not available at <name type="university"/>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.31">
<s n="s1.5;p30.31">Having read through the available material and formulated my essay question, I emailed several brief questions to my two contacts. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p30.31">They responded with their general impressions of the system, and were key in shaping my approach to the essay. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p30.31">I also telephoned firms of solicitors who had represented clients at court. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p30.31">I was provided with contact email addresses for three solicitors, to which I sent further questions. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p30.31">To date, I have not received a reply. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.31">
<s n="s1.5;p31.31">The internet was a key source during the writing of my essay, especially in order to find government reports and consultation papers. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p31.31">LexisNexis Butterworths was particularly useful for legislation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p31.31">Some wider searches however, did not provide the information sought. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p31.31">A search for the Code of Practice for Interviewing Defence Witnesses was particularly frustrating - while consultation closed 10 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> December 2004, there is no evidence of a document. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p31.31">Re-reading of books showed that sources from 2006 still refer to the document as 'being drafted'. </s>
