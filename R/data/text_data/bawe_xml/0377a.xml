<s n="s4.8;p1.12">Moreover, organs transplantation is now recognized as an established part of medical practice, while a century ago nobody could even imagine removing parts from one body to another as a saving life treatment. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.12">Scientists are crossing mile stones in half of decade while some time ago in centuries; during The First World War first blood transfusions were provided for the first time, while now we are considering face transplants. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.12">United Kingdom set few first regulations on this subject after the Second World War; the last one came into force in April 2006. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.12">However it is expected, that because of a need to give the legal body for new medical discoveries- number of legislation would be still increasing. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.12">Therefore, medicine development in organs transplant area is in my opinion -not over-regulated in UK, and will not be probably over-regulated in next few decades. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p2.12">If government proposes a new legislation, need to achieve social support for his draft. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.12">The purpose of this behavior is simply to make it obeyed by citizens when it became enforceable. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.12">To achieve it, the respect for religious statements is necessary. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.12">Otherwise it would be senseless to discuss if some issue is over-regulated, when only small amount of people would follow it, for example because of conflict with their faith. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.12">Religion has a great impact on people's behavior; in fact it is not unusual, that some of faithful keep religious principles before their duties and responsibility as citizens. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.12">In my opinion, this "spiritual" influence has not been appreciated. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.12">Thus, it is important to take into consideration how it determines our every day live, point of view etc. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.12">That's why I have decided to spend more words on this subject in my essay. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.12">It is governments' duty to have regard for social support for regulation drafts, otherwise it would be senseless to create the rules which people does not approve<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.002"/>. </s>

<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.19;p3.12">Thus, it is very important to look how different religions deal with organs transplant, to know what kind of behaviors it is possible to face with. </s>
<s n="s2.19;p3.12">Accordingly to Jewish beliefs it might be shocking, that although they have one of the most modern health care, the amount of transplantation is one of the lowest in the world.<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.003"/> It is a result of as Rabbi Daniel Sperber<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.004"/> says that "many families refused to allow organs to be removed because the Bible prohibits the desecration of bodies and delay of burial"<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.19;p3.12">However this point of view is changing, as a result of The Halachic Organ Donation Society and other's pro donation campaign- only during the last year 10 percent of potential recipients died, waiting for donation. </s>
<s n="s4.19;p3.12">The idea is to convince the Jewish Orthodox Community hoping that when the religious leaders accept the concept, the faithful will follow them. </s>
<s n="s5.19;p3.12">It is in every individual's right to agree or disagree for donating/receiving organs. </s>
<s n="s6.19;p3.12">Thus it is not acceptable to force anybody to become a donor in the name of "civilization's need". </s>
<s n="s7.19;p3.12">Explaining the advantages of this concept to its skeptics can give us a chance to make the legislation more efficient. </s>
<s n="s8.19;p3.12">As a result, making it really debatable whether this issue is over-regulated or not<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.19;p3.12">First thing, would be to stop identifying donation with religion on issues of death, prohibition of desecration of body etc. and start showing merci, compassion, saved life- purposes of this treatment. </s>
<s n="s10.19;p3.12">To persuade that organs transplantation should be recognized more as a more social, than spiritual problem. </s>
<s n="s11.19;p3.12">Only in these circumstances the clauses about "volunteer donation" that we can find in legal deeds, for example in British Human Tissue Act 2004 Code of Practice on this matter may have been "enforceable" and effective. </s>
<s n="s12.19;p3.12">Resuming, there is still a rising need to convince more and more people about reasonableness of organs transplant. </s>
<s n="s13.19;p3.12">It becomes obvious that, it is a task not only for the Member State to pass new regulation on this subject, but a great challenge for leaders (for ex. priests, politicians, philosophers) to answer the most fundamental ethical and moral questions<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s14.19;p3.12">What happens with the soul after donation is it possible to have an eternal life? </s>
<s n="s15.19;p3.12">Then, from recipient's point of view- whose body is it? </s>
<s n="s16.19;p3.12">Is it me still? </s>
<s n="s17.19;p3.12">In conclusion, it has to be highlighted that, the cooperation between the Member State and social leaders, as mentioned above, can help to increase a number of transplantation<ref target="BAWE_0377a-ftnote.008"/> in future. </s>
