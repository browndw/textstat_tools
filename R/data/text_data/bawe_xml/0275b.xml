<s n="s4.8;p1.17">The key question is how elites are classified. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.17">Dexter states that an elite can be any person given 'unstandardized' treatment for the purposes of the research, as opposed to usual assumption a person who has power or high status.<ref target="BAWE_0275b-ftnote.002"/> People do not have the same relevance to the research project, meaning some are more important than others depending on the purposes of the research. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.17">It often arises that given the extent of their knowledge and experience, those with whom elite interviewing is most appropriate are also influential. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.17">Having established what is understood by elite interviewing, it is then possible to examine its relevance to politics and with this, its strengths and limitations in relation to political research. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.17">By taking everything into consideration a conclusion has been formed to try and assess whether elite interviewing is a worthwhile technique for political research. </s>
