<s n="s1.9;p1.97">In the last decade, managers have witnessed a revolution in technology and supply chains. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.97">A variety of shocks occurring throughout markets have radically changed the way managers view their environments. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.97">The rate of change in markets, products, technology, and competitors is rapidly increasing, leading to a situation in which managers must make decisions on shorter notice with less information, and with higher penalty costs. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.97">Despite the apparent impossibility of surviving under such environment conditions, some organizations are thriving, Super Soap is an example. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.97">As Super Soap strives to increase customer value by improving performance while simultaneously reducing costs, one area that attracting its attention is procurement and outsourcing management. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.97">In this essay, we will discuss them in details. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.97">It is divided in two parts. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.97">The first part is talking about the organisational structures of procurement department, function of centralized procurement organisation and the outsourced issues. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.97">The second part will analysis three cost saving measures, which are volume concentration, best price evaluation and global sourcing. </s>

<head rend="bold">Part one: Procurement Organisation</head>
<p n="p2.97">
<s n="s1.1;p2.97">Purchasing is presented in this book as a pro-active function involved in the management of the input to the organization, and as a key element in all business in which purchase costs are a significant proportion of total revenue or budget[1]. </s>
</p>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">Traditional structure of procurement department</head>
<p n="p3.97">
<s n="s1.1;p3.97">At department level the number of people employed, the volume and variety of goods and services purchased, the ability and authority of the department head, the capabilities of the people employed in the department, and the importance of the supply function to the operation of the enterprise concerned, are among the factors which will affect the organization structure decision. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.97">
<s n="s1.2;p4.97">Nevertheless, there are basic organization patterns around which variations occur. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.97">A simple form in a small department is often something like that shown in figure 1. with the exclusion in some cases of the stock-control function from the buyer's </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0223b-fig.001">
<head>Figure 1</head>
</figure>
<p n="p5.97">
<s n="s1.4;p5.97">responsibilities, this pattern is reasonably typical of a small departmental structure. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.97">Most departments, in the UK at least, are composed of less than four people. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.97">It should be noted, however, that an organization chart is but one aspect of the matter. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.97">It tells us nothing of the scope of the job the buyer holds, etc., nor does it describe the informal aspects of the organizational activity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.97">
<s n="s1.1;p6.97">Figure 2, with similar caveats, illustrates one approach to organization structure in a larger department. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0223b-fig.002">
<head>Figure 2</head>
</figure>
<p n="p7.97">
<s n="s1.3;p7.97">The division of responsibilities in figure 1 is generally quite straightforward. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.97">The buyer assumes responsibility for the more important purchases, and his assistant deals with the more routine matters. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.97">In practice, the classic 80/20 relationship is evident in this division, for most of the money spent by the organization will tend to be concentrated on a relatively small number of items. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.97">
<s n="s1.9;p8.97">In figure 2, the allocation of responsibilities within the department is more complex. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p8.97">Generally speaking the chief buyer is responsible for the policy-making as well as the efficient management of the department as an element in the company organization. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p8.97">He usually retains responsibility, too, for the most important contracts and purchasing decisions. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p8.97">In this type of structure a decision has to be taken as to how best to group the purchasing activities so as to be most effective. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p8.97">One common approach is to do this by commodity or material groups, where each buyer deals with a particular range of items; for example, one buyer may be responsible for raw materials, another for mechanical components and another for electrical/electronic materials. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p8.97">Apart from the advantage of specialization in a particular range of goods, this helps to avoid duplication of research and negotiation effort at plant level. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.97">It should also facilitate data collection and communication inside the department and with other sections of the company as a whole. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p8.97">It can strengthen the buyer's negotiating position through consolidation of total requirements and can reduce time spent in negotiation. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p8.97">In addition, liaison with suppliers is often improved by this means. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.97">
<s n="s1.6;p9.97">However, if this approach to division of work is followed, it is important to bear in mind that provision should be made whereby a colleague can take over responsibility for a particular group of materials in the absence of the buyer normally responsible. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.97">One method which is commonly used to deal with this matter is to 'pair' buyers. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.97">Not only can this help to overcome such temporary problems, but it can be a useful means of staff development. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.97">In the organization show in figure 2, buyers 1 and 2 and buyers 3 and 4 might work together in this manner. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.97">In larger organization(see figure 3), each section will tend to become self-sufficient in this way. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.97">Development of staff in such cases, however, may involve moving people between sections. </s>
</p>

<head>Figure 3</head>
</figure>
<p n="p10.97">
<s n="s1.7;p10.97">Buyer specialization by commodity or material group may often be the best way to subdivide the work of a supplies department, but it is not always the case. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.97">In the construction industry, for instance, individual buyers or buying sections are often responsible for all purchases for particular contracts. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.97">Often these contracts amount to huge sums and the construction site may be many miles from where the responsible buyer is located. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.97">In such circumstances, a single contact facilitates liaison, even though there may be advantages in concentrating purchases for negotiation. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.97">A combination approach is frequently favoured, where buyers assigned to particular contracts place orders against contracts negotiated on a 'commodity' basis for the company as a whole. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.97">These contracts will typically, be negotiated by members of staff who have been designated as major contract buyers. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.97">Usually this work is undertaken in addition to order functions. </s>

<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Description</head>
<p n="p35.97">
<s n="s1.4;p35.97">In this situation at the corporate level, a central purchasing department can be found where corporate contracting specialists operate at the strategic and tactical level(see figure 3). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p35.97">Decisions on product specifications are made centrally(often in close cooperation with a central engineering or R&amp;D organization), and the same goes for supplier selection decisions; contracts with suppliers are prepared and negotiated centrally. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p35.97">These contracts are often multi-year agreements with pre-selected suppliers, stating the general and specific purchase conditions. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p35.97">The operational purchase activities are conducted by the operating companies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p36.97">
<s n="s1.4;p36.97">General Motors Europe and Volkswagen may serve as examples of companies which have centralized their strategic and tactical purchasing operations to a high degree. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p36.97">Other examples are Xerox and the Ford Motor Company. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p36.97">The main advantage of this structure is that, through coordination of purchasing, better conditions(both in terms of prices and costs and in terms of service and quality) from suppliers can be achieved. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p36.97">Another advantage is that it will facilitate efforts towards product and supplier standardization. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.97">
<s n="s1.2;p37.97">The disadvantages are also obvious: the management of the individual business unit has only limited responsibility for decisions on purchasing. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.97">Often the problem is that the business-unit managers are convinced that they are able to reach better conditions on their own, and will act individually; in this way they will gradually undermine the position of the corporate purchasing department. </s>
</p>
<p n="p38.97">
<s n="s1.1;p38.97">This structure is appropriate in cases where several business units buy the same products, which at the same time are of strategic importance to them. </s>

</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="underlined italic">Advantage of centralized structure</head>
<p n="p39.97">
<s n="s1.6;p39.97">Creating a centralized procurement group in a multi-plant or multidivisional environment can provide some define advantages. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p39.97">When purchasing was basically a clerical ordering function, it did not make much sense to centralize purchasing. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p39.97">The benefits gained from centrally accumulating and leveraging purchases ere usually outweighed by the reduced responsiveness and added layers of decision-making authority. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p39.97">As the scope and importance of purchasing increased, however, firms increasingly recognized the necessary of a centralized group to coordinate the overall purchasing effort. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p39.97">Centralization does not necessarily imply that the central group actually performs any buying. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p39.97">Instead, the central group managers those activities that provide advantages to the entire organization. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>COORDINATE PURCHASE VOLULMES</head>
<p n="p40.97">
<s n="s1.9;p40.97">Traditionally, the primary advantage of centralized purchasing has been to realize a favourable price due to accumulated volumes. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p40.97">Unfortunately, when firms pursued centralized purchasing, they not only centralized the sourcing of parts with suppliers but also the actually ordering process. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p40.97">This led to the widespread perception that centralized purchasing resulted in decreased responsiveness to manufacturing needs. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p40.97">There existed a widely held belief that centralization did not work. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p40.97">People believed that centralization just added another time-consuming step in the decision-making process. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p40.97">Today, however, the systems technology exists for a firm to identify common purchased items between divisions or business units for centrally coordinated sourcing. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p40.97">To facilitate this process, local purchasing personnel can still retain the authority to generate purchase releases directly to a supplier. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p40.97">A firm can achieve material cost reductions by combining purchase volumes while still recognizing the operating requirements of division or plant buyers. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p40.97">In fact with electronic data interchange systems, operating requirements are now often triggered by users and sent to suppliers, with little day-to-day involvement on the part of purchasing. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND COORDINATE PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</head>
<p n="p41.97">
<s n="s1.4;p41.97">It is difficult for a firm, if not totally impossible, to develop and coordinate a corporate procurement strategy unless a strong central procurement group exists. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p41.97">One issue is whether it is advantageous to develop a corporate purchasing strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p41.97">For most firms, the answer is definitely yes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p41.97">A strong corporate purchasing strategy provides the proper match between opportunities and resources, provides operational guidance to managers, and provides flexibility as firms adapt to a dynamic environment. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head>ABILITY TO COORDINATE AND MANAGE COMPANYWIDE PURCHASING SYSTEMS</head>
<p n="p42.97">
<s n="s1.5;p42.97">The need for advanced purchasing systems is increasingly important. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p42.97">The design and coordination of sophisticated purchasing systems should not be the responsibility of an individual business unit. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p42.97">This is particularly true if a firm plans on coordinating purchase requirements between divisions or units. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p42.97">If each division is responsible for the development of its own purchasing or part numbering system, the end result will be a mixture of incompatible systems throughout the organization. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p42.97">A centrally coordinated approach to systems development supports a system design compatible with all locations. </s>

</div3>
<div3>
<head>OTHER ADVANTAGES OF A CENTRALIZED PURCHASING GROUP </head>
<p n="p43.97">
<s n="s1.4;p43.97">A number of other benefits to a centralized purchasing department or group exist. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p43.97">Centralized authority can provide greater control over large capital expenditures. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p43.97">Inventory part number reduction, an objective of most organizations today, is also possible with a department that has the authority to oversee the activities of each operating unit. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.97">From its unique perspective at the top of the organization, a centralized group can focus on controlling the growth of total purchased part numbers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.97">
<s n="s1.5;p44.97">A central group can develop a single coordinated approach to supplier development and support it by providing corporate resources or developing uniform guidelines. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p44.97">A central group can also help to integrate first-, second-, and third-tier suppliers into a supply chain management program. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p44.97">Because significant resources and central coordination is needed for such an effort, centralized purchasing is a must to ensure the success of this strategy. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p44.97">Finally, a central purchasing group can effectively coordinate a supply base reduction program. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p44.97">This makes sure that the reduction process supports the goals of the entire organization and not just a particular purchasing department. </s>

<p n="p45.97">
<s n="s1.8;p45.97">When conducting competitive and make/buy analysis, Cummins engine performed several critical tasks. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p45.97">The first was to determine the appropriate level of abstraction, (that is, the proper unit of analysis.) </s>
<s n="s3.8;p45.97">For example, due to the sheer number of individual components in most final products, it would be nearly impossible to make a sound make/buy decision on each and every individual component. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p45.97">Therefore, it was important to aggregate, or combine, the level of analysis moving from the individual component or subassembly level all the way up to the assembly or complete system level. </s>

<head rend="underlined italic">Why outsourcing and benefits for it</head>
<p n="p47.97">
<s n="s1.7;p47.97">Companies should consider outsourcing their procurement functions for the same reasons they might outsource other operations, such as payroll or IT. Historically, the top rationale is that the work is not a core competency, and thus should be done by an organization for which the work is a core competency. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p47.97">At most companies, purchasing indirect or non-critical materials or managing basic processes such as procure-to-pay are not core competencies. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p47.97">However, many businesses now see outsourcing as a real opportunity to increase efficiency. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p47.97">This is doubly true in procurement, where significant savings can result from repositioning and centralizing large numbers of people and technologies, and avoiding burdensome investments in upgrades and new systems. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p47.97">Higher-level procurement efficiencies also exist, such as channelling more spend through aggregated corporate contracts (compliance). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p47.97">In this case, raising compliance from 60 percent to 95 percent can cut a company's cost of goods sold by as much as 4 percent. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p47.97">Across the board, it is not uncommon for procurement outsourcing to reduce the cost of materials and services by up to 15 percent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.97">
<s n="s1.7;p48.97">A major advantage to outsourcing is that it allows the buying firm a greater degree of flexibility. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p48.97">As market demand levels change, the firm can more easily make changes in its product or service offerings in response. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p48.97">Because there are lower levels of investment in specific assets, it is easier for the firm to make unexpected changes in its own production resources. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p48.97">There is a minimal investment risk for the buyer as the supplier assumes the uncertainty inherent in plant and equipment investment. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p48.97">Ideally, both the buying and the supplying firms should concentrate on their own distinct core competencies while outsourcing other products and services that are not considered areas of expertise, yet are necessary for competitive advantage. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p48.97">Also, outsourcing allows for improved cash flow because there is less upfront investment in plant and equipment. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p48.97">By using contract manufacturers, Dell computer supports $3 billion in annual revenues with only $60 million of fixed assets. </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.97">
<s n="s1.2;p49.97">A firm may achieve reductions in labor costs by transferring production to an outsource location that pays lower wages or has higher efficiencies, resulting in lower per-unit manufacturing costs. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p49.97">As the high cost of providing retirement and medical benefits continues to escalate, firms are increasingly avoiding hiring more full-time personnel whenever possible. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p52.97">The use of cost measures requires a word of caution. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p52.97">The method used to achieve cost reductions is critical. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p52.97">A cost reduction based on mutual cooperation is the same, on paper, as a cost reduction resulting from heavy-handed pressure on a supplier. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p52.97">While the end result (i.e. a cost reduction) appears to be the same, the process used to achieve that result can have longer-term implications. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p52.97">Cooperation may reduce costs through joint improvement while heavy-handed cost pressure might force a supplier to cut corners, resulting in poor quality. </s>
