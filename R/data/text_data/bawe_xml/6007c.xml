<s n="s2.3;p13.76">Cooler wetter summers and warmer wetter winters encouraged mat density of forest and shade-tolerant vegetation on rich brown earth soils across Britain. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.76">Increased precipitation promoted growth of peat in raised and blanket bogs in uplands of Britain, mainly the Highland Zone, exterminating large areas of woodland and other areas of vegetation (Morrison, 1980). </s>

<head rend="italic">Human activity</head>
<p n="p14.76">
<s n="s1.4;p14.76">The population increased under the favourable climate. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.76">However, over-hunting made larger animals rare, increasing Man's dependence on vegetation for food. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.76">The first forms of "protodomestication" developed, mainly in the form of animal husbandry (pigs). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p14.76">There was occasional growing of crops. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.76">
<s n="s1.3;p15.76">Evidence of forest clearance first appears during the Mesolithic period. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.76">People took advantage of natural clearings in the woodland but also deliberately manipulated the environment by clearing and burning (King, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.76">However, there was no advanced technology to fell trees yet, so fire and ring-barking were used (Simmons, 1996). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.76">
<s n="s1.4;p16.76">Pollen analysis has shown that Mesolithic people affected many sites in Britain, mainly by the effects of fire and grazing. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.76">There is evidence of substantial opening of forest cover on a southeast fen in Cambridgeshire (Smith <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1989). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.76">Heath replaced hazel woodland on Iping Common, Sussex, by fire or grazing (Keef <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1965). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.76">There is also evidence that Man used fire to alter the forest in favour of <hi rend="italic">Alnus</hi> at the expense of hazel at Blacklane, Dartmoor (Simmons, 1964). </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.76">
<s n="s1.2;p17.76">Climatic change in the later Mesolithic and soil maturation led to accumulation of mor humus over podzolic and gleyed soils. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.76">Some openings underwent rises in the water-table and became invaded by rushes and then accumulation of peat. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.76">
<s n="s1.1;p18.76">Moorland development in the uplands began, dominated by few species of grass, rush and sedge, replacing the former forest with more diverse fauna and flora (Simmons, 1996). </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.76">
<s n="s1.5;p19.76">In North Gill, people created and maintained existing natural openings to attract animal prey by preventing regeneration. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.76">Fire was used to retain a grassy sward and prevent invasion of <hi rend="italic">Pteridium</hi> (Simmons, 1996). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.76">At this site and many others in the uplands, loss of trees and decrease in vegetation cover and grazers (mainly wild animals) prevented regeneration. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.76">As a consequence, soil degradation by podzolisation occurred and much blanket peat developed (Simmons, 1969). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.76">The <hi rend="italic">Alnus</hi> woodland of North Gill disappeared at around 6000 BP, replaced by encroaching blanket bog. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.76">
<s n="s1.3;p20.76">In general, Britain's landscape was still predominantly wooded, though with moorlands beginning to develop in the uplands. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.76">Sporadic clearings, spatially and temporally, spanned Britain, used for stone, timber and earthen constructions and hunting (King, 2003). </s>

<p n="p21.76">
<s n="s1.2;p21.76">People continued to use clearances already formed (natural and man-made) and cultivated the fertile soils where woodlands had formerly been. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.76">There was small-scale clearance from 5,200 BP in North Yorkshire Moors (Bartley <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 1976). </s>

<head rend="bold">2.3.2 Middle Neolithic</head>
<p n="p23.76">
<s n="s1.3;p23.76">Across the more extensively cleared areas, high rainfall caused severe leaching of soil nutrients and soil erosion, especially in the uplands. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.76">Settlements and fields were abandoned in the northwest uplands, and regeneration of scrub occurred. </s>

<p n="p24.76">
<s n="s1.4;p24.76">New forms of human social behaviour witnessed during 7500 to late 5000 BP, triggered by lack of resources. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p24.76">As well as retaining existing methods from earlier millennia, Neolithic subsistence included new cereal and increased importance of livestock management (King, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p24.76">Every area available for cultivation was used, leading to extensive areas of ploughed soil across Britain. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p24.76">Extensive woodland clearance was aided with new tools and fire. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.76">
<s n="s1.3;p25.76">The population stabilised at a lower level and farming was mixed (animals and crops). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.76">Crops, mainly emmer wheat (<hi rend="italic">Triticum dicoccum</hi>), einkorn (<hi rend="italic">Triticum monococcum</hi>) and barley, were cultivated (King, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.76">Neolithic people relied much on wild fauna and flora from woodland, rivers and coast, but livestock management became increasingly important (cattle, sheep, goats and pigs). </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.76">
<s n="s1.3;p26.76">Clearances in Dartmoor are shown by fall in tree pollen and presence of clearance indicators e.g. </s>

<p n="p27.76">
<s n="s1.5;p27.76">Extensive pastures led to the development of chalk grasslands. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.76">Expansion of grasses, <hi rend="italic">P. lanceolata</hi> and Ericales occurred at this time. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.76">There was a big introduction of new weeds, which probably arrived from the continent by boat. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p29.76">Shallow tracts of peat in Exmoor began to develop in the Neolithic. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p29.76">Stock grazing in woodland under climatic deterioration and prolonged leaching caused the initiation of blanket peat (Moore, 1974). </s>

<s n="s4.6;p29.76">Shallow peats on sloping grounds (such as the Pennines, Lake District and central Wales) were initiated in the Neolithic. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p29.76">At Carneddau Hengwm, pollen analysis of underlying soils beneath the peat indicates former woodland cover, overlaid with acidic bog peats of <hi rend="italic">Eriophorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> (Moore, 1973). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p29.76">Climatic deterioration was the main influence on peat formation but was greatly facilitated by Man's activities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.76">
<s n="s1.3;p30.76">People preferred well-drained soils developed from glacial deposits, though finer-textured soils were not avoided (Grimes, 1945). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.76">In southern England, people avoided parent materials and soils sandy and poor in bases (Dimbleby,1962). </s>

<s n="s3.5;p31.76">On freely drained siliceous parent materials, acidification took place fast, rapidly followed by podzolisation. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p31.76">In western Britain, wetter conditions increased organic mat overlying many acid and poorly drained soils. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p31.76">Extensive areas of land >300m in Wales and northern England and Scotland are now treeless moors - in uplands, soils frequently poorly drained with peat, stagnohumic gley soils and stagnopodzols. </s>

<p n="p34.76">
<s n="s1.5;p34.76">Calcareous soils, clay soils, gravels - gave rise to pastures and a mix of habitats. </s>
