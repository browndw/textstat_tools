<s n="s1.5;p1.8">The <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> was written by Gregory Bechada in the twelfth-century. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.8">He was a soldier but had a good education, including knowledge of Latin, yet he chose to write his account in the vernacular, in his mother tongue of Occitan French. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.8">This was the first piece of vernacular history in French, predating the earliest Anglo-Norman texts by two decades, and continental French texts by a century.<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.001"/> It celebrates the crusaders' victory at Antioch in 1098, which was of great significance as it gave the crusaders a foothold into the Holy Lands and they then went on to conquer Jerusalem. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.8">History writing in the Middle Ages was often a combination of literature and history, so the reliability of such sources is questionable. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.8">The <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> is described as an epic chronicle; although there is undoubtedly some accuracy in his account, there is a propagandist element to it also. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.11;p2.8">The <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> was written at the request of the bishop Eustorge, and was partly a commemoration for Bechada's lord, Gouffier of Lastours, who also participated in the conquest of Antioch. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p2.8">Bechada was also advised to write this account by Gaubert the Norman. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p2.8">This may have influenced the writing as Bechada had to take their views into consideration, but it also gives the work added authority. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p2.8">His account could not solely have been his opinions or perceptions. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p2.8">Bechada was anxious about the use of the vernacular. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p2.8">Despite knowledge of Latin, which was considered the authoritative language, Bechada chose to write in Occitan 'so that the populace might fully comprehend it'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.002"/>, which was the same reason for writing in popular metre. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p2.8">Thus Bechada is concerned with stressing the truth and reliability of his writing. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p2.8">As an epic chronicle, many literary descriptions and devices have been employed which may appear to limit the credibility of the writing. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p2.8">The <hi rend="italic">chansons de jest</hi> that were common in the Middle Ages drew on historical events to highlight social and political aspects of the day. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p2.8">It is clear also that Bechada produced propaganda for the crusades, to encourage participation and support for it. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p2.8">Yet despite all these things, the Occitan fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> can still be considered as history as there is truth in his words and they do give a description of a famous incident during the First Crusade. </s>

<s n="s1.17;p3.8">The most obvious propaganda in the Occitan fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> is that for the work itself. </s>
<s n="s2.17;p3.8">'If anyone wishes to learn a song, I think he is very foolish/ if he fails to sing this one'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.17;p3.8">Although this quote can only be found near the end of the extract, it shows Bechada's concern to appeal to the audience. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p3.8">Although it is subtle, as it is not the main focus of the passage, it would influence the audience into trusting in the song. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p3.8">The Occitan fragments actually begin with a conversation between the King of Persia, King Kerbogha and his 'courtly interpreter'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.004"/>, Herluin. </s>
<s n="s6.17;p3.8">This dialogue helps to convey the Turks response to the crusaders and the battle at Antioch, or at least the crusaders' view of what the Turks thought. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p3.8">It then moves on to very detailed descriptions of the battle and the individual combats. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p3.8">There is a clear propagandist message in the lists of names of the soldiers that partook in the battle. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p3.8">It is only the highest soldiers that are mentioned, possibly those that Bechada's patron had relations with, and they are described as, 'a courageous and bold group'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p3.8">The King is portrayed as worried and anxious about the threat of the Christian army, so he seeks for consolation in Herluin. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p3.8">Herluin, however, far from relieving his fears, exacerbates them, by encouraging Kerbogha to flee, 'Noble king, why not turn and take flight?" </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s12.17;p3.8">The strength of the Christian army is emphasised to celebrate their victory and increase their prestige. </s>
<s n="s13.17;p3.8">It would also encourage others to join the crusaders as they would be impressed by the easy defeat of the Turks and by the fear the crusaders inspired. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p3.8">As the knights were depicted as heroes, others would want some of that glory too, and in this account they would have role models to follow. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p3.8">There are detailed descriptions of individual battles, commemorating certain soldiers, such as Duke Godfrey and Walter the German. </s>
<s n="s16.17;p3.8">Although epic chronicles did contain stock motifs, such as a set description of single combats, this could be seen as propaganda as Bechada chose to highlight certain men above others. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p3.8">Thus there is clear propaganda in the listing of names and the bold and valiant descriptions of the soldiers. </s>

<s n="s3.13;p4.8">Whilst many chronicles did contain incredible events, this could also be seen as propaganda as the crusaders were portrayed as having supernatural forces on their side, 'God sends them to help their friends." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s4.13;p4.8">The role of religion is also highlighted, perhaps to give justification to the battle. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p4.8">The crusades were authorised by the pope and encouraged by many ecclesiastical sources. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p4.8">Bechada may have wished to support the idea that the victory was the will of God. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s8.13;p4.8">This would ensure that people knew Heraclius had died absolved of all his sins. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p4.8">There is a great deal of hyperbole and emotive language used, again to accentuate the valour and might of the crusaders. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p4.8">Herluin is filled with pride upon sight of the army, 'he feels such joy as has never been equalled'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.010"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p5.8">The style of history writing in the early Middle Ages included many literary devices, and as most were written as songs to entertain, they had to appeal to an, often, uneducated audience. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.8">Thus whilst the Occitan fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> clearly contain much hyperbole and exaggerated description, a lot can be learnt from them about the history of the crusades. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.8">Bechada is keen to stress the truth and authenticity of his work, and to distinguish it from mere romance, seen as a 'degenerate'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.012"/> form of art. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.8">Although the names of the soldiers are clearly a commemoration of a chosen few, it does inform historians of at least some of the people who took part in the battle at Antioch. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.8">Their origins are also mentioned, which gives historians an idea of the nationalities involved, and shows just how far-reaching the crusades were, 'paid soldiers have come from all corners of Christendom.'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.8">Their armour and appearance are part of the stock motifs used in the period, but do help us to understand what knights wore at the time and what accessories they carried, 'they all carry scrips in the fashion of pilgrims'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.8">Similarly the origins and appearances of those fighting against the crusaders are mentioned, 'Kerbogha of Persia, the king of Safargat,/ and Bal of Femenia'.<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.015"/> Bechada does concede that the Turks were 'well equipped and provisioned for battle,/ since their horses are superb and the men are well armed'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.016"/>, but this may have been more to prove just how mighty the Christian army was to defeat such strong fighters. </s>

<s n="s3.13;p6.8">He used technical legal language and precise negotiating details. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p6.8">Although the reason given for this was Kerbogha's fear at defeat, which may have been an exaggeration, the mention of 'his mother the queen who had deeply frightened him'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.018"/> does contain some truth. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p6.8">The King's mother was against the battle and tried to dissuade her son from getting involved. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p6.8">The French rejected this compromise, as it was not 'the custom here in our kingdom that a Frank should come to a sworn agreement over a battle once the battle lines are drawn'.<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.019"/> This gives insight into the legal procedures of battle during the crusades. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p6.8">The fragments also illustrate the rituals of battle, such as the calls to battle. </s>

<s n="s10.13;p6.8">There is also evidence of medieval fighting tactics, as Kerbogha is described as ordering his men to 'all spur together in a single charge'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.021"/>. </s>

<s n="s4.12;p7.8">This is an incredibly mistaken view of Islam, which believes in one God, and was formed during a time of serious disillusionment with the pagan idols of the day. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p7.8">Yet Kerbogha does not correct this view of his religion and in fact uses similar terminology, 'our idols are so courageous and valiant'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.025"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p7.8">There is also a reference to Mohammed, the prophet, yet Bechada seems to think that Muslims equate Mohammed with God, 'If Mohammed wishes it so'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.026"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p7.8">This is also incorrect. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p7.8">Thus the Occitan fragments help to show the misunderstanding between the two groups. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.027"/>
<s n="s10.12;p7.8">Although Bechada is seemingly depicting his own religion as nonsensical, he is in fact showing just how ignorant the Turks were in not believing. </s>
