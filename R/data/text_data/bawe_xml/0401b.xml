<s n="s3.7;p1.20">The normalisation thesis is concerned with the accommodation of recreational drug use into youth society. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p1.20">The normalisation thesis does not mean that it has become normal for young people to take drugs, but is concerned with "the spread of deviant activity [drugs] and associated attitudes from the margins towards the centre"<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.20">There has been a rise in drug trying since the 1990s, with six in ten Britons trying drugs by the age of 18, and the reason for this increase is the increased availability of drugs "in school, college, pub and club"<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.20">Other theorists, such as Duff (who takes the normalisation thesis and extends it to Australian youth) also believe this to be the case, with a widespread increase in the use and experimentation of legal and illegal drugs among young people. <ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s2.3;p3.20">Subcultural theory is no longer relevant in discussing drugs as it has moved from a small minority experience into a majority activity.<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.008"/> Also, subcultural experience tends to gravitate towards a preoccupation with drugs as a central tenant in the users lives; the heroin user of the 1980s who pull are part of a distinct, criminal, lifestyle is one such example. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.20">The drug use described in the normalisation thesis is quite different due to its focus on recreational drug use.<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.009"/> In addition, drug use is seen to cross structural boundaries such as class, where the drug user may be middle-class, and gender, with women being as likely to take drugs as men. <ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.010"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.20">In addition, this postmodern move into the mainstream is also seen through its absorption into consumer culture. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.20">The language and imagery of drugs has become absorbed into fashion, media, and music and the boundaries between licit and illicit behaviour has become blurred, as recreational drug use and drinking alcohol link together.<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.011"/> The decline of tradition, brought about by globalisation, has eroded many of the norms that have underpinned social identity, meaning individuals rely on their own choices, struggling to maintain a stable sense of self, which leads to the production of the self through the act of consumption.<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.012"/> Youth identity is created through this act, and the goods we buy tell us something about ourselves, forming a sense of self. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.20">Drug use takes place as part of this consumer lifestyle, with leisure time being an opportunity to express identity through the stylistic use of drugs. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.20">For example, the expression of identity is seen through the use, and normalisation, of recreation drugs within the current youth 'rave' scene.<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.013"/> Recreational drug use is a vital part of this 'rave' experience, and is what Shapiro calls the "drugs/music nexus".<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.014"/> The emergence of a distinct rave community in the 1990s saw the use of ecstasy rise among the youth, with its use becoming a defining characteristic of the 'raver' identity. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p5.20">The significance of risk is associated with changes in late modernity, whereby the erosion of tradition (due to science and globalisation) has moved towards a society laden with uncertainty and constant risk as adolescents spend more time in a semi dependent state.<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.019"/> Society has become increasingly individualised, and people strive to create their identity through consumerism, making routine "recognisable cost-benefit assessments"<ref target="BAWE_0401b-ftnote.020"/> about drugs. </s>
