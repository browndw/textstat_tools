<p n="p2.50">
<s n="s1.6;p2.50">In 1865 Mendel published "Experiments with Plant Hybrids", a paper discussing how certain characteristics in the pea species <hi rend="italic">Pisum sativum</hi> are inherited, see figure 1. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.50">He proposed two laws of inheritance which described the existence of a 'hereditary element'. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.50">It was not until 1902 that Sutton and Boveri's investigation confirmed the existence of hereditary elements, known as chromosomes. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.50">Their chromosomal theory of inheritance allowed Garrod to investigate the rare disease alkaptonuria. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.50">He observed that the disease was prevalent in certain families and concluded that affected people are homozygous for a gene which causes the disease. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.50">Garrod's investigation was one of the first to be undertaken for a single gene disorder. </s>

<head>Figure 1, an example of Mendel's breeding experiments. (Conner <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> , 2002, Medical Genetics). The diagram demonstrates Mendel's genetic crosses of Pisum sativum indicating the inheritance of characteristics through alleles. If an allele is dominant then its characteristic will always appear in the phenotype. Recessive alleles only appear in the phenotype if they are homozygous. </head>

<p n="p3.50">
<s n="s1.4;p3.50">In 1953, Watson and Crick determined the structure of the DNA molecule and provided an insight into how the molecule replicated. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.50">Genes are specific sequences of nucleotides which code for amino acids that are ultimately are translated into a functional protein. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.50">If a mutation occurs in the gene, the amino acid sequence could be altered, prematurely terminated or not terminated at all. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.50">This can lead to molecular disease. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">What is Molecular disease? </head>
<p n="p4.50">
<s n="s1.4;p4.50">Molecular disease is caused by a mutational event in the DNA, chromosome structure or a change in the chromosome number of an individual, preventing the correct protein from being synthesised. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.50">This generates a variety of molecular diseases which will be discussed in this essay. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.50">Molecular disease does not arise due to infection from a microorganism, although some viruses can induce a mutation leading to the molecular disease cancer. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.50">For example the notevirus causes a type of leukaemia. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.50">
<s n="s1.3;p5.50">When the genetic code is altered from its original condition a mutation occurs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.50">The two main types of mutations, point mutations and length mutations, cause different changes to occur in the DNA. Point mutations occur due to mutagens altering a single base in the genetic code leading to a spontaneous mutation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.50">There are two types of point mutations, transversions where a purine is changed to a pyrimidine, and transitions where the same type of nucleotide is exchanged leading to same sense, missense and nonsense mutations. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.50">
<s n="s1.3;p6.50">Same-sense mutations will not cause molecular disease. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.50">A single base pair change occurs causing the same amino acid to be coded for, in the polypeptide. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.50">Therefore the protein remains. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.50">
<s n="s1.3;p7.50">Missense mutations occur when a single base pair change leads to the replacement of an amino acid. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.50">This can lead to molecular disease as the resultant protein will be different. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.50">An example of such a mutation is sickle cell anaemia. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.50">
<s n="s1.4;p8.50">Sickle cell anaemia is an autosomal recessive disease which arises from a missense mutation at the sixth codon. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.50">The correct amino acid, glutamic acid, is changed to a valine residue at this position producing a mutant protein. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.50">The mutant Î²-globin causes erythrocytes to become distorted in situations where oxygen levels are low. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.50">The protein crystallises, becoming insoluble forcing the erythrocytes into a sickle shape, reducing survival time leading to severe anaemia. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.50">
<s n="s1.5;p9.50">Affected individuals inherit two mutant HbS genes from both parents. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.50">Carriers of the disease are heterozygous for the HbS gene as the presence of the HbA gene allows sufficient HbA to be produced preventing the complications of sickle cell anaemia as shown in figure 2. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.50">These individuals suffer from the sickle cell trait. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.50">The frequency of sickle cell anaemia is higher in areas were malaria is endemic. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.50">In Africa, 1 in 500 (Cited from <seg type="URL" n="www.kumc.edu/geu/frof/prevalnc.html"/> 29/04/03) people are affected as the sickle shaped erythrocyte confers resistance to the parasite. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p10.50">Nonsense mutations involve a point mutation producing a stop signal in the gene. </s>

</p>
<p n="p11.50">
<s n="s1.3;p11.50">Frameshift mutations cause molecular disease. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.50">If a single base pair is added or deleted, the triplet reading frame is altered. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.50">Such mutations tend to nearly always completely inactivate the protein, as the new codons are more likely to be stop signals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.50">
<s n="s1.3;p12.50">Length mutations are characterised by the loss or gain of genetic material and include deletions, trinucleotide repeat amplifications, insertions and duplications. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.50">Duplications and insertions normally cause single gene disorders. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.50">Deletion mutations involve a single base pair, kilobases of DNA or even whole chromosomes though most occur from the breakage of the chromosome due to parental rearrangement. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.50">
<s n="s1.3;p13.50">Trinucleotide repeat amplification occurs within or between genes making them unstable if they are longer than the critical number of repeat elements. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.50">Providing they are within, or near a gene, a single gene disorder may occur. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.50">The instability of extended repeats causes the disease to vary in severity such as Huntington's disease. </s>
