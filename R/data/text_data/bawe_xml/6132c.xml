<s n="s3.4;p3.23">(9) When passing in the proximity of the sun, the intense heating experienced by the comet causes the ice to evaporate allowing streams of gas and debris that fall away from the frozen core giving rise to the well known comet tails. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.23">(3) They follow regular eccentric orbits (not entirely circular) usually around the sun and this is why some such as Haley's comet reappear every few years (76 in this case) when they pass by us. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p6.23">The Torino scale is similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, it is a set of values from 0 to 10 used to describe the seriousness of a potential collision. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p6.23">The seriousness of a potential collision is dependent on the its likelihood (dependent on the trajectory) and magnitude (dependent on size and speed). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p6.23">A value of 0 indicates that the likelihood of a collision is effectively zero and a value of 10 that a collision, capable of causing global catastrophe that may threaten the future of civilisation as we know it is certain. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p6.23">The values 1 to 9 are on a sliding scale between these two extremes. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p6.23">For example a 50m asteroid similar to the one that exploded above Tunguska, Siberia in 1908 flattening of about of pine forest (3), would merit a rank of 8. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p7.23">This scale is designed to increase the communication between astronomers and is not designed for public communication. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.23">(8) This scale reflects the urgency of the threat by considering its possible impact energy, the probability of collision occurring and the date of impact, it also takes into consideration the background impact level (normal state of affairs of asteroid impacts). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.23">The consideration of the date of impact is useful; for example, if a 200m long asteroid was set to collide with the Earth in 2045 it would obviously be of great concern to the public and governments and have a high Palermo value but, if it where only forecast in say 2845, the population anxiety level would not be perturbed and its rating would fall. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p9.23">Different media are aimed at different sectors of the public. </s>

<s n="s3.11;p9.23">Readership numbers of all papers have declined and today the percentage of the population who are communicated to with this media are very few. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.23">The newspaper industry is a business, the companies need to sell papers and therefore only print stories that are newsworthy, that will sell because they are of public interest. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p9.23">Consequentially one expects much hype and exaggeration of the issues especially in situations involving risk as a public threatened will want to read all about it. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p9.23">Films are usually aimed at as wide an audience as possible targeting all sectors of the public and consequently are designed to be attractive to all. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p9.23">Books are usually written due to the whim of the author for the pleasure of all interested parties. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p9.23">Factual text books are written on the basis of research and therefore should contain accurate information (at the date of publication) and fiction, sci-fi in this case often blends fact and fantasy to the authors own preference and therefore may lead to misconception on the part of the public. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p9.23">Internet is a very useful tool for communication. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p9.23">Internet sites target interested parties. </s>

<s n="s4.13;p10.23">The title "End of the World" attracts the reader by instilling fear into him or her yet the sentence after, (also in prominent type), soothes the audience stating "don't panic folks...its not till May 4, 2102". </s>
<s n="s5.13;p10.23">This is confusing as while clearly instructing the reader to remain calm it suggests to the reader that the situation is worthy of panic. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p10.23">This is a common feature throughout the article, the phrases "nightmare scenario" and "date with Armageddon" are all closely positioned near phrases saying 'don't panic'. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p10.23">The opening sentence of the article it reads, "An asteroid with the greatest ever chance of hitting the Earth has been discovered by astronomers", this is in error as the Earth is constantly bombarded by asteroids. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p10.23">It indicates also by this sentence that all asteroids are large, destructive bodies of rock. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p10.23">The article contains a clear and accurate description of the immediate and long-term consequences of the possible collision. </s>

<s n="s11.13;p10.23">It presumes that the audience know what an asteroid is and that they have a qualitative understanding of bomb power "a force equivalent to all the worlds' nukes". </s>
<s n="s12.13;p10.23">This article is extremely short and limited; the audience will gain no information as to the nature of asteroids or the general background threat, or the nature of the risk. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p11.23">This film communicates the threat of an asteroid collision with the Earth as a concept worthy of consideration. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.23">The film itself is a visually and emotionally powerful sensory overload combining adventure, fear and love. It complements good quality acting, directing and special effects, and contains a mix of sincerity and jokes. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.23">Unfortunately in order to increase the blockbuster worth of the film, some situations were included which were scientifically erroneous. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.23">For example, the explosions and fire which occurred on the asteroid would not have happened in a the real world as an asteroids gravitational field is too weak to hold an atmosphere that might contain gasses capable of causing a prolonged fire. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p12.23">Although this is a work of fiction it contains much about the history of astronomy and the specific branch of the study of asteroids and consequentially is a mine of knowledge.(1) </s>

<s n="s2.6;p22.23">Films like newspapers dramatise the situation in order to achieve a good story as does some literature yet, the situation is such that dramatising does not falsify the situation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.23">This risk is not something to lose sleep over the chance of death due to asteroid collision is 1 in 20.000 compared to a 1 in 100 chance of dying in a car crash. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.23">However asteroid collisions about 50m in diameter that would destroy an area the size of New Jersey occur on average 1 per 100 years. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.23">The last, the Tunguska meteorite impacted in 1908 so on that front we are due another, additionally averages are not certain and nature is often surprising, there is no reason why an asteroid with globally devastating results should not occur tomorrow. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.23">The evidence supporting the consequences of a collision is factual, it has been developed over a long period of time, this time period has allowed for ample scrutiny for errors and therefore the theories have a good base and are, as far as we know, correct. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p23.23">The nature of the risk has in general been well communicated to the public. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.23">None of the information or method of representation in the media studied would have induced a state of hysteria into their intended audience. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.23">Some of the information presented by the media is incorrect yet this is essentially only the details, for example the false representation of the surface chemistry of an asteroid in the film Armageddon, would not have significantly effected the consequence of impact had it occurred. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p23.23">It is a confusing and complex subject as demonstrated by the precise nature of its jargon (asteroids comets and meteorite) and simplification (present in the article from the Sun) is bound to result in error a precise understanding of the terms is unnecessary for a good appreciation of the risk. </s>
