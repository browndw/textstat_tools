<s n="s1.5;p4.52">The electronegativities of X and A provide quantitative measures of the strength with which the hydrogen is stripped of electron density and hence interacts with acceptor atoms, playing an essential role in establishing which atoms can take part in hydrogen bonding as well as the strength of the resulting interaction. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.52">As shown in <hi rend="italic">Figure 1.2b</hi> [3], the strongest hydrogen bond will arise from F-H donors; decreasing in strength to the O-H and N-H configurations, and more controversially to C-H. Due to the variety of donor-acceptor pairs and strengths of interactions that were discovered over time, attempts were made to classify the interactions into 'very strong', 'strong' and 'weak' based upon various parameters such as the bond energy and the typical H···A distance <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> although the situation is still difficult to define (see <hi rend="italic">Table 1</hi>) [3]. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p5.52">As well as the C-H···O, C-H···N interactions, this classification also includes weak π bonds, where the acceptor has no lone electron pairs but a π electron orbital such as in a multiple bond or aromatic ring [3]. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.52">Multiple bonds and cyclic arrangements occur frequently in organic chemistry due to the high abundance of carbon and its necessity to create four attachments to surrounding atoms. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.52">The bond energies of weak interactions are comparable with van der Waals forces, whereas some very strong hydrogen bonds exhibit energies close to many covalently bonded systems. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.52">
<s n="s1.2;p6.52">In early years, the effects of the hydrogen bond were seen long before it was given a name, and there were few methods available in order to study the interaction in detail. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p7.52">X-Ray and neutron diffraction experiments can provide direct information regarding stereochemistry of crystal structures; with regards to hydrogen bonding, it is crucial to know the position of the hydrogen atom and in turn the bond lengths and angles associated with different atoms can be observed. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.52">Crystallographic data stored in databases such as C.S.D.<ref target="BAWE_0306b-ftnote.001"/>† has made it possible to compare certain trends of strong and weak interactions in large numbers of crystals. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p8.52">When a hydrogen bond is formed the vibrational motion of the surrounding atoms is restricted, leading to frequency shifts sensitive to the strength of this bond. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.52">IR is still a major tool in this field, with around 100 papers written every year regarding hydrogen bonding [2]. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.52">However, while the correlations of structural and vibrational parameters prove true for stronger bonds, the effects of weak hydrogen bonds on vibrational spectra are less clear and can often be misinterpreted due to their frailty. </s>

<p n="p9.52">
<s n="s1.2;p9.52">There is still much controversy amongst structural chemists as to whether these 'weak', 'non conventional' hydrogen bonds, such as the C-H···O or aromatic X-H-Ph bonds that occur so frequently in molecular biology, can indeed be regarded as stabilising interactions. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.52">While the conventional hydrogen bond has been long established in determining stable and predictable crystal packing arrangements [4], we must now establish whether the close proximities we observe in non conventional systems can similarly be attributed to the presence of a weaker hydrogen bond, or are simply chance arrangements caused by the other existing forces [5]. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p10.52">NMR spectroscopy already enables us to chemically analyse crystals but, by comparison with other methods, truly compliments the investigation into hydrogen bonding. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p10.52">The sensitivity of this technique makes it especially useful in identifying weak donors such as C-H or weak acceptors such as multiple bonds or aromatic rings. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p10.52">NMR and crystallographic data can be further reinforced using semi empirical or quantum chemistry calculations such as ab initio molecular orbital calculations that predict theoretical energy values of intermolecular interactions. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p10.52">Of particular relevance to the hydrogen bond, first principles calculations of chemical shift values have generally been found to agree within experimental limits [6,7]. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p10.52">As well as proton chemical shift data, the measurement of dipolar couplings with Double Quantum NMR techniques allow us to determine hydrogen proximities, to add to the direct detection of bonds via hydrogen bond mediated J couplings in liquids, and more recently, in the solid state [7,8,9].The full potential of solid-state NMR has not yet been recognized in this area, and some of the above techniques shall be exploited in this investigation. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p50.52">The role of the weak C-H···O bond as a stabilizing interaction in structural chemistry seems evident from this and many studies, and as the recorded number of such interactions increases [5], so does the likelihood that these arrangements do not simply occur by chance. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p50.52">The distances and angles given in the supramolecular structure of uracil are comparable to the stronger N-H···O hydrogen bonds, present suggesting notable if not equal importance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p50.52">Also, the flexibility of the ranges of these geometrical parameters makes the weaker hydrogen bonds even more likely to influence crystal engineering. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p50.52">Equilibrium crystal structure arrangements are such a precise balance of many molecular interactions that it is extremely unlikely for such an importance influence as the hydrogen bond to cease acting at well defined distances and electronegativities. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.52">
<s n="s1.3;p51.52">Some of the NMR data presented in this investigation proved slightly weaker than expected in detecting these hydrogen bonds due to interference from other interactions caused by the sensitivity of the technique. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p51.52">To add to this, poor resolution of <hi rend="sup">1</hi>H solid-state results made definite conclusions more difficult, highlighting the need for more advanced techniques in proton NMR. <hi rend="sup">13</hi>C data also supported the existence of weak interactions, again somewhat inhibited by other processes, and particularly in S3.2 the lack of predicted peaks suggests possible errors in sample preparation or contamination. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p51.52">Of course ever present and all important when considering NMR chemical shifts is errors of calibration and reference of spectra, particularly when used as solitary evidence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.52">
<s n="s1.1;p52.52">However, this emphasises another key factor to such an investigation; that the best possible results were obtained when spectroscopic and crystallographic data were combined [40]; and this is evident here as the most conclusive results were obtained from higher resolution proton proximity data when used along side crystal structure information to support weak hydrogen bonding interactions. </s>
