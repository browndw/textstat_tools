<s n="s1.5;p71.71">In Appendix 3 graph showing the input current, photon and carrier density, the photon output increases at threshold, as in semiconductors; the photon output is generated by injecting a large number of carriers into the active region of the device, bringing the carrier density within that region from below to above lasing threshold. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p71.71">When the carrier density exceeds that value, the ensuing stimulated emission results in the generation of a large number of photons. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p71.71">However, carriers are depleted as a result of stimulated emission faster than they are injected. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p71.71">So the carrier density eventually falls back to below lasing threshold, which results in the termination of photon output. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p71.71">If carrier injection has not ceased during this period, then the carrier density in the active region can increase once more and the process will repeat itself. </s>
