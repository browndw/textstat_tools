<div2>
<head rend="bold">2.1 Overview:</head>
<p n="p19.58">
<s n="s1.6;p19.58">Jolly SU is currently the third largest Sonite producer<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.001"/> in the market with 21.8% of the retail shares. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p19.58">It is not competing in the Vodite market. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p19.58">There are no Research and Development projects in progress but there have been both improvement projects to modify and improve existing products (SUSI) and to develop brand new products (SUKA). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p19.58">Jolly SU has no loan history and therefore has no liabilities in the form of loan repayments. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p19.58">The average selling price of a Jolly SU Sonite is $184 which gives an average profit of $87.46 per unit sold as cost per unit is $96.54 on average across all three brands; resulting in a 90% profit per unit. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p19.58">The retail stores take their average mark up of 34.75%, as the average retail price is $282. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p20.58">The current budget for both the previous period and this one is K$<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.002"/> 8700. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.58">The budget is usually 40% of the net contribution, that is 40% of K$20581 which equals K$8232.40 but if this value falls below K$8700 then it is automatically raised to K$8700. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.58">This outcome is due to the poor company performance in the last few quarters. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.58">This has resulted in the Growth Share Index<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.003"/> for the Sonites market looking like figure 1 below: </s>

<s n="s2.3;p21.58">Conjoint analysis denotes that price is very important so this should be rectified. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.58">A consequence of excess supply coupled with decreased demand for Jolly SU's products are 19,000 units in inventory, which is costing money each period to store. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p22.58">The remainder of this section is split into subsections to aid clarification and allow a more in depth study. </s>

</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">2.2 SUSI:</head>
<p n="p23.58">
<s n="s1.5;p23.58">The Sonite SUSI sold 76,824units raising revenues of K$9705 in the previous period with a middle pricing strategy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p23.58">This brings its cumulative total to 623,000 units and a contribution after marketing to K$22022. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p23.58">Apart from a peak in period 6 where 105,884 units were sold, unit sales have been steady, averaging 86,186<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.004"/> units per period. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p23.58">Usual production level is either 75,000 or 100,000 units as production levels are buffered by 20%, that is that production levels can be altered to either 20% more or 20% less than instructed, depending on the demand for the product. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p23.58">Therefore when the level is set at 100,000, if demand is only 80,000 or demand is 120,00 production is adjusted to either of these two values or any in between, depending on what the market dictates. </s>

<p n="p26.58">
<s n="s1.2;p26.58">SUSI uses a concentrated targeting approach on the 'others' segment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.58">This is because the ideal values that 'others' possess and the dimensions of the SUSI are very similar. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.58">
<s n="s1.3;p27.58">As a result the advertising is primarily targeted at 'others' (80%) and only slightly at Buffs (8%) and Singles (12%) (as there are some features close enough to their desired values that the wavering customer may be tempted by the SUSI). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.58">There are currently 666,000 others who hold 32.7% of the total market. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.58">Over half of these others, 51%, shop in mass merchandise stores. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.3 SULI:</head>
<p n="p28.58">
<s n="s1.2;p28.58">SULI's current production level is 100,000 units. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p28.58">With a recommended retail price of K$495 it is by far the most expensive sonite Jolly SU sell; and its most lucrative; it provides the largest contribution after marketing of the three brands at K$158,734 over the seven periods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.58">
<s n="s1.2;p29.58">After two periods of impressive growth rates of 25.3% and 22.1% in periods one and two respectively, sales of SULI decreased by 19.6% in period four and have continued to decline since. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.58">This can clearly be seen in the fact that at its peak in period 3, SULI sold 180,172 units compared with only 89,876 in period 7. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.58">
<s n="s1.3;p30.58">This can be partly attributed to the fact that there has been only a moderate increase in the size of the professional market, which is the target market for SULIs over the past seven periods. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.58">The market is also set to take a down turn with forecasted figures showing that in five period professionals look set to decrease form 132 to 86, a 34.85% decrease. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.58">Professionals are the target segment because the SULI is most suited to their needs as shown in both the ideal values and MDS Brand perceptions table below, figure 3: </s>

<s n="s1.6;p31.58">This was not always the case though. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p31.58">Up until period 4 a multiple segmentation strategy was used, targeting both the professional and hi-earner markets. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p31.58">It proved unprofitable as the two segments optimum values were too different and another company was better positioned to provide hi-earners with the perfect product and therefore Jolly SU avoided the potential majority fallacy. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p31.58">The professional market was far larger allowing more potential profit. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p31.58">A modest portion of the advertising (20%) is targeted at hi earners still, however as the SULI have enough characteristics similar to the ideal values that professionals want to warrant it. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p31.58">The other 80% is targeted at professionals. </s>

<p n="p32.58">
<s n="s1.9;p32.58">The SUKA is a new project which was introduced into the market, after research and development by the current management team, in period 4. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p32.58">Since then demand has grown to 177,356 units in period 7. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p32.58">It was tailor made to target the single market, the ideal values held by the singles segment formed the basis for the research project, right down to the optimum price of $220. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p32.58">Price penetration greatly assisted the growth as a predatory pricing policy was adopted, that is it was priced below similar products from competitors. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p32.58">SUKA already commands 30.7% of the total singles market the bulk of Jolly SU's total singles market (37.4%). </s>
<s n="s6.9;p32.58">This is why that the entire advertising budget is targeted at the singles. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p32.58">Advertising expenditure is K$1926 for period 7 but has previously been higher as it was a new product so brand awareness needed to be established. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p32.58">The average selling price for a SUKA is $145 with the unit cost being $92 it has a $53 profit per unit sold. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p32.58">This is not a vast amount which is why sales volume is very important for the SUKA. The MDS scaling display that the brand perceptions are very close to the singles market, figure 4: </s>

<s n="s3.5;p41.58">The advertising experiment<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.009"/> shows that an increase of 20% in the advertising budget would result in losses for SUSI and SUKA but would increase the change in contribution after marketing to $286,000 for the SULI. Therefore the recommendation is that the advertising budget for the SULI should be increased by 20% from K$1725 to K$2070. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p41.58">The other two should be decreased by 10% each to accommodate this. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p41.58">Advertising research should be reintroduced into the budget at K$100 per brand (approximately 5% of total advertising expenditure). </s>

<p n="p43.58">
<s n="s1.15;p43.58">The options available under the product variable of the marketing mix are to improve existing products, introduce a new product or shelve a 'problem child'. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p43.58">Demand for SULI is declining and the professional market is forecasted to fall further to 213, 000 units so it may be worth removing the SULI from the market if it begins to make a loss. </s>
<s n="s3.15;p43.58">The current products are as close to ideals of the target segments as can feasibly be achieved without investing much time and money. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p43.58">As there is likely to be little or no return on this investment, it seems wise to invest in an area with profit potential. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p43.58">This potential marketing opportunity may be found in the as yet un-entered Vodite market. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p43.58">Jolly SU is one of only two firms in the market yet to have a product in the Vodite market. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p43.58">Firm 'E' produced the first Vodite in period four and firm 'O' then followed suit in period 5. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p43.58">There are obvious barriers to entry and exit in contemplating the move into the Vodite market, not least that the current producers have already established a customer base. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p43.58">For instance firm 'O' has 58.4% of the total Vodite market. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p43.58">This apparent strength may be a weakness, however, if the other firms are caught in the competitive box<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p43.58">This may mean that if in period 8 research into ideal values for Vodite characteristics is carried out, the product could be developed in period nine and launched into the market in period ten. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p43.58">A loan would be needed but if the research is in depth then it would not be too much of a liability. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p43.58">Using the semantic scales and the segment size forecast the Vodite could be produced to the desired specifications for the target group preferably the one set to increase the most or have the highest number of purchasers. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p43.58">Obviously there is the development risk<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.011"/> as with all new ventures especially as Jolly SU is not the first entrant in the Vodite market. </s>

<p n="p46.58">
<s n="s1.3;p46.58">On reflection of this experiment and other information, the sales force should be increased by a total of 30 with extra ten workers in each store, an investment in the people variable of the marketing mix. </s>

<head rend="bold">4. Jolly SU: Marketing Lessons Learned</head>
<p n="p50.58">
<s n="s1.7;p50.58">Several key concepts have been learned. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p50.58">First, that the budget does not have to be spent in its entirety. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p50.58">There is no benefit to investment if the return or value gained in return (not necessarily monetary) is the same or equal to the input amount. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p50.58">This is particularly the case with advertising. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p50.58">This is where any extra budget was dispersed and too little or a detrimental affect. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p50.58">Therefore to succeed in a market takes more than just huge advertising expenditures. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p50.58">Promotion alone does not equal success, other factors from the marketing mix have to be incorporated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p51.58">
<s n="s1.1;p51.58">The possibility of researching existing products with the view to lowering base costs is worth investigating, as Jolly SU would benefit from the extra profit margin. </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.58">
<s n="s1.1;p52.58">It was also found that although market segmentation was more simple than multiple segmentation, it is crucial to appeal to the chosen segment in order to survive. </s>
</p>
<p n="p53.58">
<s n="s1.4;p53.58">Target markets need to analysed and compromises have to be made. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p53.58">For example, the SUSI and SUKA markets have the potential to increase as both target markets, others and singles respectively, increase. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p53.58">But on the negative side these sectors have the two lowest average prices per unit at only $195 for others and $225 for singles. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p53.58">Therefore although the markets are advantageous in that the growth rates are impressive the profit margin and amount is lower and therefore the overall contribution by these products is lower. </s>
</p>
<p n="p54.58">
<s n="s1.2;p54.58">More in depth analysis of the market research is necessary to improve the performance as all the 5 P's affect marketing<ref target="BAWE_0165b-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p54.58">This could have been achieved either by splitting the group into separate areas of the marketing mix or redressing the imbalance in workload of group members. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p56.58">Based on a previous company product, the SUSI, the modifications were not exactly what the target segment required and therefore was scrapped. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p56.58">Another resulting lesson was sometimes it is better to 'cut your losses' and either don't launch a product or remove it from the market. </s>

<p n="p57.58">
<s n="s1.7;p57.58">Getting the perfect product by listening to customers pays dividends as can be seen by SUKA's vast increase in sales in first few periods. </s>
