<s n="s1.6;p1.18">In this essay I am going to discuss how different Spartan women were in comparison to their Greek counterparts. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.18">There are no writings from Spartan men or women, so it is difficult to know what Spartan life was really like. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.18">The sources provide an understanding of how non-Spartans viewed Spartan women, so my investigation will focus on the 'Spartan mirage', not the reality. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.18">Alcman is the only Spartan source but it is unclear whether he was a Spartan, or was a foreigner living in Sparta. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.18">If the latter is the case, he, like Xenophon, would be comparing Spartan women to those from his previous community. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.18">To assess the differences I will look at the lifestyles, personalities and relationships of the women. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.18">
<s n="s1.9;p2.18">In regards to the females' lifestyles, it must be emphasised that this is how the non-Spartans depicted the women. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.18">It is not a reflection of reality and the way it opposes other Greek ideals could reflect how the men have created this idea, to enable them to safely examine what it would be like if females did appear differently. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.18">Their lifestyles include appearance, exercise, and domestic chores. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.18">Spartan women were 'deprived of make-up'<ref target="BAWE_6109c-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.18">This may have been preferable as it made them appear more masculine, in the same way their strong, well exercised, healthy bodies did.<ref target="BAWE_6109c-ftnote.002"/> A masculine appearance may have been sought after as males were accustomed to homosexual relationships, so it would have eased their transition from sex with males to females. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.18">Pomeroy<ref target="BAWE_6109c-ftnote.003"/> believed Spartans banned cosmetics as exercise gave the women a healthy glow. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.18">It could be argued this glow also made them more masculine, as it emphasised that they had been outside. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.18">This contrasted with the white lead used by Athenians, emphasising their sheltered lifestyles and separation from men. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.18">Although Athenian women were permitted to wear make-up, Ischomachus preferred his wife not to, believing it was an act of deception. <ref target="BAWE_6109c-ftnote.004"/> </s>
