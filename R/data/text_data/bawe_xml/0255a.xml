<p n="p1.32">
<s n="s1.7;p1.32">The European Union is considered to be suffering from a crisis of legitimacy because it lacks the essential pre-requisites of a democratic polity as traditionally conceived in Western political doctrine. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p1.32">The debate concerning the EU's legitimacy is generally centred on two main normative conceptions of governance in Europe. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.32">Firstly, the ardently supranational, state-centric approach, which attacks the legitimacy of the Union for lacking the qualities that constitute liberal-democratic nation states - the only truly legitimate political organisation in European thought to hold the allegiance of the masses. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.32">And, secondly, the functional, regulatory-type, multi-level governance approach that criticises the EU's dubious legitimacy since it has ventured beyond rational, pragmatic association and clashed with the nation state. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.32">Overall, effective assessments of arguably the most crucial aspect of legitimacy - identity - are rare. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.32">From both perspectives, the establishment of a European identity which recognises the EU as a legitimate polity, either in the United States of Europe, federalist sense, or in the multi-level governance sense of rationally divided competencies between various levels of government, identity is critical. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.32">Without popular support and recognition the EU will remain in a state of limited legitimacy regardless of whether or not contingencies are made for popular participation, or whether or not the EU is limited to purely economic co-operation. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined bold">I. Outlining the Debate</head>
<p n="p2.32">
<s n="s1.5;p2.32">The issue of legitimacy in the European Union is fundamentally a normative question of political association. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.32">The EU is often recognised as suffering from a 'democratic deficit' in which its institutions and legislative system do not appear accountable to the voice of the people. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.32">The cause for concern comes amid the culmination of the integration process which now commands increasing socio-political expectations. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.32">The EU is not seen as a legitimate because it is lacking the fundamental requirements of a political association or political community.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.001"/> In many instances, the EU is compared to the only standard political organisation which exists in the modern European conscience, the nation state, and is predominantly found wanting. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.32">Arguments abound as to the essence of the political organisation the EU is aspiring to become and whether or not potential destinations are desirable or not. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.001">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">It is worth noting here that the distinctions between community and association are derived from Ferdinand Tönnies theory of <hi rend="italic">Gemeinschaft</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gesellschaft</hi> in which community is taken to be 'real and organic' and association is an 'imaginary and mechanical structure', Ferdinand Tönnies <hi rend="italic">, Community and Association</hi>, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955, p.37 </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p3.32">
<s n="s1.7;p3.32">The EU is regarded as illegitimate because of the absence of a common European identity. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.32">In the meantime, in order for the EU to rectify its increasingly dubious legitimacy two solutions are put forward in the literature and are critiqued here. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.32">The first is that the EU should reform its institutions in order to achieve a greater level of participation. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.32">This means a more direct popular input into the EU legislative system and a certain weakening of national autonomy. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.32">The second - reliant on a perception of democratic legitimacy which values technocracy and functionalism - is that the EU must develop in conjunction with the nation state to better provide for the protection of human beings from transnational exigencies. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.32">In both cases, either via popular participation in transnational governance or via functional co-operation among states, the fundamental issue of achieving a common identity and legitimate political community is not challenged and can be resolved. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.32">The normative elements of the discussion are coloured by the perennial debates that exist within European Union scholarship in general, revolving around the functionalist, intergovernmentalist, and federalist triad. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.32">
<s n="s1.2;p4.32">To avoid entering what is perhaps an essential debate concerning the concepts of democracy and democratic governance, for the purposes of this short study, these two terms will be understood as synonymous with legitimate authority in Western political doctrine. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.32">In this sense, it is essential to acknowledge the arguments of scholars such as Yves Mény and Andrew Moravcsik who believe that the applicability of the term democracy has changed over time to represent changing attitudes as to what distinguishes popular consent in relation to legitimate rule.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.002"/> It stands to reason that EU governance has moved perception beyond liberal democratic, nation-state notions of democracy and that even these concepts are considered 'impure' compared to the ideal type.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.003"/> Others disagree; suggesting that the EU ought to emulate the nation state as it is the only form of legitimate political organisation available to us.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.004"/> Therefore, the debate rages on fuelled by this normative discord.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.005"/> In the final assessment it is perhaps more convincing to conceive of the EU as a supplementary authority and a "post-modern polity" whereby 'the EU rules alongside, rather than in place of, national governments'.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.006"/> </s>

<s n="s3.4;p7.32">These structural problems, according to Featherstone, are the root cause of the EU's legitimacy crisis. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p8.32">Thus the EU sits in contrary distinction to the state in the public conscience. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.32">It is national governments that represent 'democratic accountability over the exercise of power', whereas Brussels appears somewhat autocratic.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.015"/> The functionalist rationale requires an almost entirely 'depoliticized process', but this has not been the case. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.32">Politics has ravaged the functional legitimacy of which the Commission in particular, and the EU in general, was intended to represent. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.32">As the EU strives to exert 'political leadership' it is found 'wanting'.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.016"/> It is difficult to imagine democracy extending beyond the nation state while the state itself remains fixated with its status 'as the ultimate locus of authority'. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.32">To foster participation 'across national boundaries without treading on sensitive issues of government and while working with relatively modestly financed and very narrow bureaucratic confines requires a good deal of ingenuity'. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.32">The Commission is concerned to establish facilitators for cross border co-operation and association, which include a transparent and comprehensible legislative system, in order that 'disaffection, scepticism and hostility will decline' which represent 'an undercurrent of public concern as to the meaning and implications of union'.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.017"/> </s>

<s n="s1.6;p26.32">Moravcsik, along with Majone, Thomas Zweifel, Scharpf and others, paints a convincing picture of the nascent, non-majoritarian, multi-level system of governance in Europe in which the EU is designed to aid the resolution of transnational governance issues that affect sovereign states. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p26.32">For instance, the Commission's legislative initiative on issues where greater public involvement is customary - say, environmental regulation, consumer protection, and executive appointments - is in practice falling to the directly elected European Parliament, which must give final assent to such legislation'. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p26.32">In other instances, governance practices occur exactly as they do in any other non-majoritarian democracy. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p26.32">Issues such as central banking and the constitutional court are generally 'insulated...from powerful (and sometimes protectionist) special interests'. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p26.32">Furthermore, spending and taxation are severely capped and the EU has no formal armed forces. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p26.32">The 'constant scrutiny' involved in EU politics makes it 'more transparent and less corrupt than almost any other national government in Europe...were the EU the only means for political representation in Europe, one might have reason to be more concerned'.<ref target="BAWE_0255a-ftnote.059"/> Unfortunately, the legitimacy of the EU is undermined by the vested interests of national political parties which in turn undermines the efficacy of the EU to supplement the power of the state which it was designed to do. </s>
