<s n="s1.7;p2.21">The Shapiro-Stiglitz model portrays involuntary unemployment as a worker-discipline device. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p2.21">Under these circumstances, the payment of a wage in excess of market-clearing represents an effective way for firms to provide workers with an incentive to work rather than shirk<ref target="BAWE_0226b-ftnote.001"/>, promoting productivity and reducing labour costs. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.21">However, in the presence of full employment, wage incentives are not enough to prevent workers from shirking. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.21">If a worker is caught shirking and fired, with full employment, he could find a job immediately, there would be no penalty associated with losing his job and therefore no real incentive not to shirk. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.21">Only if there is a cost to being fired then the threat of being dismissed from the job if caught cheating creates an incentive not to shirk. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p13.21">As previously mentioned, a higher unemployment rate will typically decrease the probability of an unemployed worker finding a job; therefore, an increase in the unemployment rate would increase the penalty associated with being fired and cause a fall in the non-shirking condition. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.21">However, an increase in the aggregate unemployment rate also causes workers to start believing that they are more likely to be fired in the future due to exogenous factors. </s>
