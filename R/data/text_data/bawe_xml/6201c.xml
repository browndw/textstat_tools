<p n="p1.28">
<s n="s1.3;p1.28">This episode in Sophocles' 'Antigone', between Creon, King of Thebes, and his last surviving son, Haemon, gives a strong indication of one of the great causes of tragedy in the ancient world. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.28">This is the idea of a lack of understanding between a father and a son, because of clashes in opinion or thought, and through a stubbornness of nature, which is what not only brings about this lack of relationship and understanding, but also a large proportion of the tragedy that springs from it. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.28">In this case, the tragedy set in motion is a double tragedy, that of Haemon, who will die an unhappy death, hating his father and, ultimately, that of Creon, who will lose everything and everyone he has cared about. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.28">
<s n="s1.3;p2.28">On the surface, this passage is about a conflict of ideas about Antigone, who Creon believes is a traitor to the State as he describes the treason that is the act of her burying her brother as 'the sickness that's attacked her'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.001"/>, but who Haemon believes has acted nobly and rightly. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.28">However, reading underneath the words allows the reader and the audience to explore the deeper theme of how costly a lack of understanding between father and son can be, which is also a theme illustrated similarly in Euripides' 'Hippolytus', with the idea of the relationship between Theseus and Hippolytus, which is shown by the fact that Theseus unquestioningly believes Phaedra's accusation against Hippolytus, showing that he has never been entirely trusting of his son, and only realises his mistake at the end of the play when it is too late. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.28">This is not to say that Creon is distrustful towards Haemon in the same way that Theseus is towards Hippolytus, but instead that he is so consumed by the desire to appear as a good king that he finds himself putting the affairs of the State above everything else, including his family, which is why he 'fails both as a father and a civic leader'. <ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.002"/> </s>

<p n="p3.28">
<s n="s1.3;p3.28">Creon is an unusual figure in Greek tragedy, because he appears to simply be the 'typical tragic hero who collaborates in his own downfall'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.003"/>, however it is clear that his character is not as simple as this. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.28">He is a man under an immense amount of pressure because he wants to be a good king and he knows that everything he does on his first day in office will dictate what the people think of him and it is this which makes him ignore other viewpoints and brings about the clash with his son in something familiar in Greek tragedy, as 'two strong wills inevitably clash - the son eager and impassioned, the father hardened by duty'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.004"/> as is shown by his words to Haemon 'the city <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the king's - that's the law!'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.005"/>, a view sharply contrasted by Haemon, who is very much on Antigone's side, as he fights for justice and for what he believes is right, despite the fact that he 'declares that no marriage means more to him than his father'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.006"/>, earlier in the play, with the words 'No marriage could ever mean more to me than you'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.28">This is not to suggest that Haemon is a hypocritical figure, but instead it shows Creon's inability to accept what he believes is an action against his own rules, or his own inflexibility. </s>

<p n="p4.28">
<s n="s1.6;p4.28">It can be argued that Haemon is equally as inflexible as Creon in this passage, because he too refuses to back down on his beliefs that Antigone has done nothing wrong, and it is this which destroys any possibility of a father and son relationship between them. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p4.28">While it is true to say that Haemon is clearly on Antigone's side, he does not always make this entirely obvious at the start, as he does not simply argue her case insultingly to Creon, but instead he tries to use rational and tactful rhetoric to make him be flexible rather than firing personal insults on his father's judgement, even if he believes it to be wrong. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.28">This shows an element of flexibility on Haemon's part which is missing in his father, as he is capable of calm negotiation when he knows that hot-headed impetuosity will achieve nothing, but it also goes a long way to illustrating the emotional conflict with his father, as Creon is unable to see the situation from his son's perspective. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.28">With his words 'Why, you degenerate - bandying accusations, threatening me with justice, your own father!'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.008"/>, Creon is showing that he feels Haemon is not only being disloyal to him as a king, but also as a son, once again showing the inflexibility which makes a functional relationship with Haemon almost impossible, and which ultimately brings about the tragedy of the play. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.28">This having been said, Haemon has faults too, which are exploited in his later words to Creon, as he tells him 'Then [Antigone] will die...but her death will kill another'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.009"/> and, even more powerfully, with his last words to him 'And you will never see me, never set eyes on my face... </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.28">Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.010"/>, which shows that, for all his earlier tact and rational speech earlier on in the scene, Haemon can be impulsive and insulting as he rages at Creon before leaving, his final words to his father later ringing true. </s>

<p n="p5.28">
<s n="s1.1;p5.28">What is really interesting about the characters of Creon and Haemon in this passage, apart from the evidence that a functional relationship as father and son is impossible between them, is that, despite the fact that Creon has the authority over Thebes as king, it is actually Haemon who comes off better and has a greater sense of authority here, as he has the ability to be rational in the face of adversity which Creon appears to lack, meaning that Haemon comes across in a more mature light, giving an idea that, if he were a ruler and a father, he would be able to balance the two roles much better than Creon himself does. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p6.28">A figure of fatherhood is a crucial element in Greek drama, but especially in tragedy, as he can be used to illustrate the principles of tragedy according to Aristotle, which are that tragedy is 'an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.011"/> in some cases by contradicting them. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.28">I will be focusing on will be Euripides' 'Hippolytus', where I will be exploring the character of Theseus as a father figure towards Hippolytus, and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon', where I will be exploring the characters of Agamemnon and of Thyestes, the father of Aegisthus, to show how a father figure can also have a strong influence by being absent and also to show the conflict between fatherhood and kingship, which is especially shown by Agamemnon. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p8.28">Throughout the play, Euripides makes it very clear that Theseus is the dominant figure of fatherhood. </s>

</p>
<p n="p9.28">
<s n="s1.8;p9.28">Hippolytus is an interesting figure in the play for several reasons, one of which is the contrast between himself and Theseus. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.28">Hippolytus is very much an 'ephebic' figure, or a young man who has not quite reached adulthood. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.28">It is clear that he passes his time with appropriate pursuits for such young men. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.28">The first time he appears in the play, he has just been hunting and he has also made a garland for the statue of Artemis, a goddess of hunting. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.28">This is extremely important because, like many of Hippolytus' traits, it shows how he is 'detached from human relations and unchanging'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.013"/>, not only in that he is showing no signs of moving out of the hunting phase into any other phase - in other words showing his unwillingness to mature - but also in showing one of his other major character traits. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.28">Hippolytus is chaste, in the same way that the goddess Artemis was chaste, and he intends to prolong his chastity, because he shuns marriage. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.28">Hippolytus' chastity is one of the factors which brings about his tragedy, because he is punished by Aphrodite, 'not simply because his way of life has no place for sex, but because he rejects it and rejects the worship of the goddess'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.014"/>. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.28">It also shows a huge contrast with the figure of his father, Theseus, who 'was known for a polygamous love life'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.015"/>, even though, after Phaedra's death, he honours her memory when he says: </s>

<s n="s2.2;p10.28">However, I believe that this is not the case, since, as the play progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Theseus and Hippolytus have few or no common features and Euripides is using this device to show that, despite Theseus renouncing his polygamy in the face of his wife's death does nothing to give him similarity with Hippolytus, who refuses marriage and sex completely. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p13.28">Theseus' story in the 'Hippolytus' is a tragedy within a tragedy, as it shows the fall of a great figure in just one day. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p13.28">However, the tragedy stems from 'Theseus being what Theseus was and a relationship (or rather a complete lack of relationship) between Theseus and Hippolytus'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.021"/>, which is because the two characters are so different. </s>

<s n="s4.7;p13.28">Some critics have argued that 'by having Theseus instantly believe Phaedra, Euripides suggests that he has never entirely trusted his odd son'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.022"/>, whereas others argue that 'Hippolytus [is] a man belonging to a world apart'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.023"/> from the 'polis' and from what constitutes the average Greek male, which is what Theseus represents, whereas Theseus is the opposite to his son and so has never understood him. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p13.28">Personally, I am inclined to believe that the tragedy of Theseus, and also the tragedy of Hippolytus, stems from both these factors. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p13.28">It is Theseus' inability to understand his son which leads to an inability to trust him the way a father should be expected to trust his son and this is what leads to their downfall. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p13.28">The lack of relationship between the two is emphasised by Theseus' description of his confrontation with Sinis, a bandit he claims to have killed, and the idea of the rocks being ravaged by the sea<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.024"/>, which 'suggests the whole realm of cruelty and bitter experience... [is] in contrast to the innocence of [Theseus'] woods-and mountain-loving son'<ref target="BAWE_6201c-ftnote.025"/>, which again emphasises their contrasting backgrounds and the lack of a relationship between them. </s>
