<s n="s1.9;p3.17">The earliest successful Spanish settlement in North America was in Florida's capital, St. Augustine, which was established under Pedro Menendez de Aviles in 1565. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.17">Although trading outposts had already been established earlier in the century, for example in Columbia, St. Augustine's was destined to be a military outpost from where the Spanish could defend their trade routes and treasure from privateers sanctioned by the English government (until the 1604 Peace Treaty). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.17">The majority of the small Spanish population in Florida were <hi rend="italic">hidalgos</hi>, most of whom were single young men engaged in Government service. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.17">Thus, there were few families, and those that did exist were often hybrid as a result of intermarriages, with their children being identified as <hi rend="italic">mestizos.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.17">English settlements were not so complex as their 'Northern American societies saw less racial mixture." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s6.9;p3.17">The complex stratification of the Spanish is further enhanced by the variations between Hispanic immigrants in St. Augustine, including divisions between <hi rend="italic">peninsulares</hi> of the Iberian Peninsula, and Spanish-American <hi rend="italic">criollo</hi>, as focused upon in Corbett's article.<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.007"/> Among the <hi rend="italic">peninsulares</hi> there were additional differences, much more intricate than those between, for example, the English and the Scottish. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.17">As a result, St. Augustine has accurately been illustrated as 'a melting pot of ethnic groups, loosely bound together by... the Spanish Crown." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s8.9;p3.17">Corbett significantly observes that the source of migration to St. Augustine, during the period of 1671 to 1691, was actually from Spanish Mexico, highlighting internal migration from colonies of New Spain. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.17">English settlements also contained people derived from varying ancestries, as a result of internal movements, particularly in the middle colonies of New York and Pennsylvania. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s2.6;p4.17">However, in direct contrast to early Spanish incentives for North American colonies as military bases, the result of the three English missions to Roanoke in the 1580s, despite <hi rend="italic">initially</hi> being a military expedition, was the discovery of the value of the land for cultivation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.17">Consequently, the English decided to establish a permanent self-sustaining settlement there and in 1587, under Sir Walter Raleigh, 'the first English families to settle in the Americas'<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.010"/> arrived at Roanoke. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.17">However, its success was minimal as it had been mysteriously abandoned by the 1590s. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.17">This differs significantly with St. Augustine, which, although being burnt down in 1586 and rebuilt, remained a permanent settlement for two hundred years. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.17">It is ironic that St. Augustine's was not originally intended as a permanent colony yet persisted as one nonetheless, despite never significantly increasing in terms of population, whereas Roanoke's <hi rend="italic">eventual</hi> overall purpose was as a lasting agricultural settlement yet it perished within a few years. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p5.17">Trade and profit through the exploitation of the New World were key motivational factors. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.17">This was particularly true of the English who wished to break the Spanish monopoly over North America, consequently leading them to a greater share in the American wealth. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.17">Thus internal competition and rivalry for prestige and prosperity was stimulated. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.17">However, the English were unsuccessful in their formation of the economic settlement of Jamestown, at Virginia's Chesapeake Bay in 1607, as it was built by a malarial swamp that led to the death of the majority of the migrants. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.17">
<s n="s1.2;p6.17">The principal reason for the proceeding English settlements in New England were based upon a diverse religious vision of a pure colony, as opposed to financial importance, incited by the Pilgrims in 1620, and followed by the migration of the Puritans the following decade. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.17">Unfortunately, 'New England ultimately failed as a "city upon a hill"'<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.011"/> although it sustained 'an especially diverse and complex economy'<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.012"/>, which was ultimately beneficial. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p7.17">Their religious structures differ considerably in terms of relationship with political and social life. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.17">For example, 'English... colonies remained without a formal nobility, even on the small scale that the Spaniards created in their colonial realms." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.013"/>

<s n="s2.2;p8.17">As in St. Augustine, many early English settlements contained few women or families, which were significant as the stable 'foundation of colonial society'.<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.015"/> The structure of New England was, in contrast to both Virginia and St. Augustine, more cohesive as 'family units of the English population were moving essentially intact'.<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.016"/> Sometimes even entire communities migrated, cited by Bailyn as being either <hi rend="italic">metropolitan</hi> (primarily from London) or <hi rend="italic">provincial</hi>, depending on the area of England from whence they came which subsequently determined where they migrated.<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.017"/> For example, indentured servitude was a 'major characteristic of the "metropolitan" migration... overwhelmingly dominant in the flows to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia'<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.018"/>, the central colonies. </s>

<s n="s1.11;p9.17">Maryland, founded by the English in Virginia in 1634, was a relatively successful settlement as they accommodated the Native Indians to a greater extent than the English in the Chesapeake, who had not formed a good relationship with them. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p9.17">However, both England and Spain westernised the Indians, with alcohol, guns and ammunition. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p9.17">Moreover, both were notorious for brutalising and terrorising the Indians. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p9.17">As Taylor surmises, the English promoters of migration depicted the Spanish as 'uniquely brutal colonizers... the Indians of Virginia would welcome the English as their liberators'.<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.019"/> However, 'Spanish and English mariners sometimes kidnapped or killed Natives',<ref target="BAWE_0129a-ftnote.020"/> often the Spanish being increasingly more brutal, reflecting that the English were far from liberating. </s>
