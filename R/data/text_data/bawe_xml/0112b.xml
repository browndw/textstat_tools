<head rend="underlined">Centromere</head>
<p n="p8.34">
<s n="s1.5;p8.34">Centromeres are highly complex chromosomal substructures involved in essential aspects of chromosome transmission during cell division. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.34">The centromere/kinetochore complex is responsible for directing chromosome movements in mitosis and for progression of mitotic events at the transition between metaphase and anaphase. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.34">For accurate chromosome segregation interactions must occur between the centromere/kinetochore complex and the spindle apparatus. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.34">In most organisms the centromere appears as a constitutively functioning structure that exists at a defined position of a monocentric chromosome. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p8.34">In some eukaryotic organisms (not mammals) centromere activities are distributed throughout the entire length of the chromosome forming a holocentric structure (Choo <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2001). </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.34">
<s n="s1.8;p9.34">During cell division centromeric DNA attaches to spindle microtubules through a proteinaceous structure, this is the kinetochore. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.34">The outer region of the kinetochore assembles when the chromosome condenses to allow the microtubules to attach, and will dissociate again after chromosome segregation. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.34">The inner kinetochore is present in the DNA at all points of the cell cycle and is formed by special centromeric chromatin and associated foundation proteins (Henikoft <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.34">Despite the conserved function of centromeres across species they lack any conserved DNA sequence, but most centromeres do show a particular similarity. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.34">That is that they comprise of long stretches of short tandem repeats called "satellite DNA sequences" that are only found in the centromere and the surrounding pericentric heterochromatin. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.34">In humans this repeat is knows as α-satellite DNA and this 171 base pair monomer is arranged in a large head-to-tail tandem array. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.34">Although this sequence is found in all normal human centromeres it is not the deciding factor of centromere location. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p9.34">In stable 'dicentric' chromosomes where due to rearrangement, a chromosome contains two centromeres, the centromeric function is often lost from one of the two α-satellite repeats (Amor <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.34">
<s n="s1.7;p10.34">The second piece of evidence to support the theory that DNA sequence is not determining factor for centromere location is the presence of neocentromeres. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.34">These are ectopic centromeres that originate from normal noncentromeric regions of a chromosome and therefore do not contain the α-satellite repeat (Choo <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.34">A neocentromere shows an ability to function like a true centromere, and there have been a small number of documented cases to prove it. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.34">A Neocentromere may take on the role of a centromere when the true centromere has been removed from the chromosome. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.34">This is possible due to rearrangement and breakage of the chromosome, leaving a dicentric chromosome and a centromere devoid chromosome. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.34">However due to a lack of α-satellite repeat the formation of the centromere must take place via a method not linked to DNA sequence. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.34">Epigenetic factors must play a role. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.34">
<s n="s1.3;p11.34">Thirdly the presence of heterochromatin does not define the centromere, it is known that heterochromatin is present around the centromere but it is also found at chromosome telomeres. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.34">If heterochromatin is the deciding factor in centromere development then telomeres would demonstrate some of there activity. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.34">This confirmed that merely the presence of heterochromatin does not create a centromere. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.34">
<s n="s1.2;p12.34">This evidence shows that the location and function of the centromere is dependant upon more than just a DNA sequence and general chromatin type, the molecules that comprise the centromeres chromatin must give the centromere its function. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.34">Centromeric chromatin must be different on a molecular level to that of normal chromatin. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.34">
<s n="s1.9;p13.34">Centromere location is determined by a collection of at least six kinetochore foundation proteins that assemble in a hierarchical and co-dependant fashion. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p13.34">The kinetochore is a densely staining fibrillar region with the centromere, to which spindle microtubules attach during meiosis or mitosis. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p13.34">The kinetochore proteins bind to both the DNA and the heterochromatin that is located either side of the core centromere region. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p13.34">In humans the kinetochore assembles on the α-I subfamily of α-satellite DNA repeats. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p13.34">These six proteins are CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C, CENP-H, CENP-I and the most recent addition hMis12. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p13.34">The first three are thought to associate with centromeric DNA therefore directly forming the centromere chromatin (Politi <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2002), CENP-H, CENP-I and hMis12 are thought to form part of the kinetochore structure. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p13.34">The α-I satellite DNA repeats contain a 17 base pair CENP-B box motif, to which this protein will bind. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p13.34">These six proteins (excluding CENP-B) are essential for centromere activity and are also found at neocentromeres. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p13.34">This demonstrates that this chromatin protein is more of a deciding factor for centromere location then DNA sequence. </s>

<p n="p27.34">
<s n="s1.5;p27.34">There is some evidence to suggest that the clustering of CENP-A along the centromere domain is conserved among all multicellular eukaryotes partially because of if its similarity to the functional centromere of <hi rend="italic">S.pombe (</hi>Zinkowski <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1991). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p27.34">Both CENP-B and C localise to the DNA in centromeres so they must occupy a specific domain within the model (figure 6). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p27.34">Immuneoprecipitation studies were completed and discovered that CENP-C localises in the discontinuous domains with CENP-A upon the same nucleosome. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p27.34">The CENP-B protein showed a different distribution pattern, it co-localised at points with CENP-A but the majority did not. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p27.34">The determining factor for CENP-B position was the availability of CENP-B box motifs within the DNA, these existed both across the CENP-A and H3 containing nucleosome regions. </s>

<p n="p28.34">
<s n="s1.5;p28.34">To determine the 3D organisation Amor <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2004 used deconvolution microscopy to examined the human centromere. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p28.34">The CENP-A protein was shown to hold a cylindrical form at the centromere. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p28.34">This structure was parallel to the axis of the chromosome at the inner kinetochore plate. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p28.34">CENP-C occupied a marginally different domain, but one that did overlap in regions to the CENP-A domains. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p28.34">It appeared to wrap around the pole-ward face of the CENP-A domain of chromatin (Figure 7). </s>

<p n="p29.34">
<s n="s1.2;p29.34">Correct localisation of the proteins CENP-H, CENP-I and hMis12 has proved challenging and no firm conclusions have yet been made. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p29.34">Some immunofluorescent 2D analysis has highlighted the possibility that these proteins are also localised with CENP-A and CENP-C (Campbell <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003). </s>

<hi rend="italic">Figure 7:</hi> <hi rend="italic">3D organization of human centromere: Linear chromatin fibre might coil through a 3D cylindrical structure like a solenoid, which would enable the individual blocks of CENP-A-containing nucleosomes to form a single domain consisting of a series of repetitive functional subunits at the poleward face of the metaphase chromosome, where they interact with the remaining foundation kinetochore proteins. On the opposite face of the chromosome, the intervening blocks of histone H3 would also form a single domain. The extent to which this inner H3 domain is heterochromatic or euchromatic is the subject of debate and, in turn, has implications for the localization of cohesin (shown in grey in this region), which is recruited to the centromere by heterochromatin. In the left-hand coil, unique sequence DNA is shown in dark green; other repeat elements are shown in dark blue; -II satellites are shown in pink; -I satellites are shown in orange; scaffold or matrix proteins are shown in grey. In the right-hand coil, CENP-A is shown in red; CENP-B is shown in light green; CENP-C, CENP-H, hMis12 and CENP-I are shown in purple; heterochromatin is shown in yellow; euchromatin is shown in blue; and regions of uncertain heterochromatin or euchromatin status are shown in half blue and half yellow.</hi> Sourced from: Amour <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2004</head>

<p n="p30.34">
<s n="s1.2;p30.34">Just as with the linear model the location of CENP-B is entirely dependant upon the position of CENP-B DNA motifs to which the protein can bind and is not influenced by the presence of other centromeric proteins. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p30.34">Again this model showed that some CENP-B was located at the inner kinetochore plate but that most is to be found in the surrounding heterochromatin (figure 7). </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.34">
<s n="s1.4;p31.34">We can be certain about one structural characteristic of the centromere, that is the regions containing CENP-A in can not form heterochromatin. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p31.34">This is because the structure of heterochromatin is determined by modification of H3 such as methylation of lysine residues and hypoacetylation of the H3 tail. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p31.34">The tail of H3 is not conserved in CENP-A so, when CENP-A replaces H3 within the nucleosome then theses modification will not take place, so heterochromatin will not be formed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p31.34">A further observation proving the different between the two is the ability for gene transcription to occur in CENP-A containing chromatin and not in heterochromatin. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Conclusions </head>
<p n="p32.34">
<s n="s1.3;p32.34">The organisation of centromeric chromatin is significantly different and unusual to that of the rest of the chromosome. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.34">Difficulties in studying this structure have arisen because the chromatin changes during the cell cycle and the exact mechanisms as to how have not yet been identified. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.34">A further problem for study is the variability of centromeric chromatin across different species, the largest advances have occurred in the study of budding and fission yeasts but these organisms show certain centromeric differences to that of mammals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.34">
<s n="s1.3;p33.34">From all the data gathered it is clear that the DNA sequence at centromeres is not the determining factor for centromere location although it clearly plays some role in centromeric protein recruitment. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.34">It seem fairly certain that epigenetic factors contribute significantly to the formation of centromeres, the most noteworthy of these is the discovery of CENP-A histone H3-like protein. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.34">This molecule creates centromeric chromatin that is structurally different to euchromatin and heterochromatin, and aids the recruitment of other key centromeric proteins such as CENP-C. </s>
</p>
<p n="p34.34">
<s n="s1.1;p34.34">Further studies into the production and recruitment of CENP-A and the other proteins utilised in the centromere should provide further insight into centromeric organisation. </s>
