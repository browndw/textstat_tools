<s n="s2.10;p1.14">Just several years after the Treaty of Westphalia, which is generally agreed to be the birth of the modern nation state, was Hobbes theorising and legitimising this state already? </s>
<s n="s3.10;p1.14">There are of course many different versions of the 'modern state' and no single one can claim to be true. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p1.14">This does not, however, stop us from appraising 'Leviathan' in terms of its modernity. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p1.14">There is a constant struggle in the latter half of 'Of Man' and the early chapters of 'The Commonwealth' between rights as an individual and sovereignty and power of the state. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p1.14">These questions are still relevant today, and political theory since Hobbes has challenged and sought to expound the problems between 'liberties' and 'obligations'. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p1.14">I shall begin this essay by offering a summary of Hobbes' account of the state and then examine the possibility of 'Leviathan' being a modern state, particularly by comparing it with the political writings of Max Weber. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p1.14">I shall then look at differing views of the modern state that refute Leviathan as modern. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p1.14">My conclusion will be that there are concepts within Leviathan that are uniquely modern, and how the social contract tradition was vital in the formation of modern states. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p7.14">This at least on the surface implies some kind or interaction between the rulers and the ruled. </s>
