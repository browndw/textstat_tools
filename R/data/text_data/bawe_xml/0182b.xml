<s n="s1.5;p1.25">
<name type="other"/> is a 55 year old woman. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.25">She has a stoma from a total colectomy and iliostomy performed in 1976 to treat serious ulcerative colitis. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.25">This stoma is well managed by <name type="other"/> and needs little attention from healthcare professionals. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.25">Her main current health presentations are bronchiectasis and recurrent bouts of depression. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.25">The depression first developed in 1993 following her son's suicide. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.25">
<s n="s1.3;p2.25">She is divorced, lives alone in a well-maintained and well looked after council property and receives the lower rate of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) as she was forced to give up her work as a school dinner lady because of her bronchiectasis. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.25">Her elderly parents live nearby and she visits them daily. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.25">Her daughters also live locally and visit regularly with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.25">
<s n="s1.2;p3.25">In addition, <name type="other"/> has a large network of friends, three of whom she goes on regular overseas trips with. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.25">These holidays are much cherished and are important goals that are worked towards during the intervening periods. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.25">
<s n="s1.3;p4.25">
<name type="other"/> doesn't drive. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.25">She began to take lessons but her initial bout of ulcerative colitis made it impractical for her to continue at that time. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.25">She has subsequently developed Dupuytren's contracture <hi rend="sup">1</hi> (requiring two operations on her right hand) which she feels, combined with her other conditions, would make it impossible for her to take lessons again now. </s>

<head rend="italic">Interview I - <name type="other"/>
</head>
<p n="p5.25">
<s n="s1.5;p5.25">The development of <name type="other"/>'s ulcerative colitis coincided with her second pregnancy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.25">Six weeks after the birth of her second child she was admitted to hospital with suspected bowel cancer. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.25">Ulcerative colitis was diagnosed but a "very arrogant doctor" failed to adequately explain the issues surrounding the proposed colectomy and so <name type="other"/> declined treatment. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.25">She now feels this "was very silly". </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.25">Some years later the condition returned and surgery was performed, but the inflammation had become so severe and widespread that an iliostomy was also needed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.25">
<s n="s1.3;p6.25">Following surgery <name type="other"/> was offered, and undertook counselling within a group of patients who had also undergone iliostomies. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.25">She found this a great help and the group still meet annually. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.25">Her husband was also offered counselling, but declined. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.25">
<s n="s1.2;p7.25">She discovered 'stoma care' following a severe infection of the stoma that required antibiotic treatment and was impressed by the care she received at that time, and by the ongoing stoma care provisions. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p7.25">However she still very much feels that when meeting new people, at least on first impressions, "people look at the bag, not me". </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.25">
<s n="s1.2;p8.25">In 2002 <name type="other"/> suffered a hernia under the stoma that she was initially told was inoperable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.25">Two years later a second, "younger" doctor told her it was operable and the operation was a great success. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.25">
<s n="s1.5;p9.25">
<name type="other"/> feels that by some margin her worst condition is the bronchiectasis. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.25">It can be very debilitating and limit her freedom considerably. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.25">On bad days she has difficulty getting up the stairs in her house. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.25">She tries to manage the bronchiectasis as effectively as possible by not over-exerting herself and using steroids when the condition is particularly severe. <name type="other"/> found the coughing fits associated with the bronchiectasis initially very frightening and self-perpetuating, but now understands the aetiologies of the attacks and consequently feels better able to cope with them. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.25">It was these episodes that caused her to give up her work. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.25">
<s n="s1.3;p10.25">Similarly, she has suffered from depression for long enough to recognise the first symptoms of its recurrence and tends to be pro-active when seeking help. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.25">She generally prefers counselling to drugs as her younger sister "has been on anti-depressants since she was 18 and I've seen what that did to her. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.25">I don't want that to happen to me". </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.25">
<s n="s1.1;p11.25">
<name type="other"/> is very happy with the care and support she receives from both her GP practice and the stoma care team. </s>

<head rend="italic">Interview II - Stoma Nurse, <name type="other"/> Hospital</head>
<p n="p12.25">
<s n="s1.5;p12.25">The stoma care team operate on a 'drop-in' basis. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.25">The stoma nurse has an important role in helping patients with stomas adjust their diet to their changed circumstances, particularly regulating fluid intake in patients whose colon has been removed. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.25">Individual patients have individual dietary needs and there can be substantive changes in diets pre- and post-operatively. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.25">They also provide information on new technologies/devices, updated stoma care advice and play a key role in adapting to the psychological changes caused by the operation. <name type="other"/> visits the stoma care team about once a year, mainly to keep abreast of new devices and up to date stoma advice. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.25">The stoma nurse thinks that <name type="other"/> copes "remarkably well". </s>

<head rend="italic">Interview III - General Practitioner, <name type="other"/> Medical Centre</head>
<p n="p13.25">
<s n="s1.1;p13.25">
<name type="other"/> attends the GP surgery regularly, generally for treatment of secondary lung infections exacerbated by the bronchiectasis. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.25">
<s n="s1.2;p14.25">The GP's main concern is her depression and he tries to actively maintain a continuity of care with patients with psychiatric illnesses. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.25">He feels this enables him to better monitor a patient's mental health and intervene at the earliest possible opportunity. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.25">
<s n="s1.1;p15.25">He suspects <name type="other"/> will probably decline gradually over the next 10 years as her lung function continues to deteriorate. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="italic">Interview IV - Practice Nurse, <name type="other"/> Medical Centre</head>
<p n="p16.25">
<s n="s1.1;p16.25">The Practice Nurse was not available for interview. </s>

</div2>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Management Plan</head>
<p n="p17.25">
<s n="s1.3;p17.25">From a psychological perspective it will remain very important to keep <name type="other"/> as physically healthy as possible to enable her to continue going on the trips abroad that are of such importance to her and which are greatly looked forward to. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.25">They give her a feeling of independence and enable her to feel in control of her health, rather than vice versa. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.25">The social capital derived from these interactions can not be underestimated and is of great significance to her current level of well-being. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.25">
<s n="s1.2;p18.25">The impression of the treatment her sister undertakes to counter her depression is negative and <name type="other"/> is very clear that she wants to avoid anti-depressant use wherever possible. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.25">Therefore she is more likely to confront the re-emergence of the depression and actively seek the counselling she feels is the best solution for her. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.25">
<s n="s1.4;p19.25">The variable experience <name type="other"/> has had with doctors illustrates the importance of effective doctor-patient communication. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.25">"Good doctors identify patients' problems more accurately, and patients are more satisfied with the care they receive."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> If we look at <name type="other"/>'s initial consultation for ulcerative colitis she was left ill-informed and possibly inadequately treated. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.25">It may be that a colectomy after the first consultation could have negated the need for the subsequent iliostomy. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.25">In this instance the paternalistic approach clearly let <name type="other"/> down whereas later care strategies based on the shared model of doctor/patient interactions have been of significant benefit in both the short and long term.<hi rend="sup">3, 4</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.25">
<s n="s1.3;p20.25">However, an interesting feature of this interaction is her GP's prognosis that she will probably die in the next 10 years. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p20.25">He felt it was unnecessary and probably counter-productive to share this prognosis with <name type="other"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p20.25">This is a clear example of the need to be flexible in one's approach to one's patients and to change the nature of the doctor-patient dynamic where necessary.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.25">
<s n="s1.3;p21.25">Both psychological and psychosexual implications of the stoma <hi rend="sup">5, 6</hi> were identified by <name type="other"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p21.25">Her desire not to be defined by 'the bag' is a common reaction to the operation, and her determination to continue pursuing an active a life as possible is testament to her determination that this be the case. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p21.25">She in part contributes the breakdown of her marriage to the psychosexual effects of the stoma and bag; she said her husband "couldn't cope" with the changes to her body. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.25">
<s n="s1.3;p22.25">
<name type="other"/> receives the lower rate of DLA, but as her condition deteriorates she will need to be reassessed for the higher rate of DLA and/or additional benefits. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p22.25">The local Citizen's Advice Bureau would be able to help her explore her entitlements. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p22.25">In addition, over the coming years she is likely to need home help and given her bronchiectasis makes climbing stairs difficult, alternative accommodation will eventually need to be considered. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.25">
<s n="s1.3;p23.25">She identified her inability to drive as a considerable restriction upon her. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.25">On days when her bronchiectasis is particularly severe she finds it impossible to visit her parents without the help of friends or family who can drive her there. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.25">Coupled with inadequate public transport she is reliant on these people, but uncomfortably so. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.25">
<s n="s1.5;p24.25">In conclusion, the management of <name type="other"/>'s care should continue along current lines. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.25">Her conditions are well-managed and she is happy with the level of care provided. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.25">Routine communication is open and effective, not only between <name type="other"/> and the healthcare professionals, but equally importantly within the healthcare team. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.25">It is vital for her continued well-being for her depression to be managed effectively. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.25">In this case it is clear that both the healthcare team and the patient are working towards the same goals. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.25">
<s n="s1.3;p25.25">In somewhat of an aside, we felt that <name type="other"/> would make a good candidate for inclusion in the Expert Patient Programme <hi rend="sup">7, 8</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p25.25">She is articulate and enthusiastic and already has a good understanding of her conditions and the impact they have on her daily life. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p25.25">Involvement in this programme could <name type="other"/> other social and intellectual opportunities. </s>
