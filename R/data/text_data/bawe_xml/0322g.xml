<s n="s2.5;p2.16">The hardships of various social groups will be assessed, and in particular those of African Americans and Farmers. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.16">To provide a more balanced discussion, this essay will look at the impact of some of the New Deal work and relief programs and how they may have helped alleviate the hardships faced by particular groups in society. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.16">Despite the devastation wrought by the great depression, a new era of American culture emerged, a culture forged by the struggles of the American people. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.16">It is necessary to ascertain to what extent a collective popular culture helped relieve some of the distresses of the 'hard times.' </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.6;p3.16">Many historians chose to write of the great depression in reference to events occurring following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.16">However, this discussion chooses to deal with the concept of social and economic hardships, and although the 1920's are often described as a period of economic prosperity, jobs were only easily available for those who worked in economically booming sectors. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.16">The impression that this was a decade of prosperity for all is far from accurate. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.16">Traditional staple industries and staple labour suffered a period of decline and before 1930; 16 million families were receiving less of an income than the minimum necessary to provide for the basics of life. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.16">Farmers overproduced due to more advanced techniques and suffered due to the falling costs, which left them with a income-production deficit ratio meaning they couldn't afford to pay back the money borrowed to purchase machinery, including tractors. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.16">Rural poverty became a characteristic of many remote areas, so much so that a separate section details the intense hardships faced by the farming community beginning in the 1920's. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.5;p4.16">'The Great Migration,' a mass movement of more than 6 million African Americans from the South to the North of The United States took place following the First World War. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.16">With a sense of cultural pride following their participation in the war, Black Americans felt optimistic about their chances of finding well-paid work in the Northern States. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.16">Many, however, experienced resentment and hostility and could only usually find low-paid unskilled work. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.16">African American hardships between this period and throughout the 1930's will also be covered separately. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.16">Other groups to suffer before the crash of 1929 included working-class women and Native Americans who found their land systematically stripped from their possession. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.3;p5.16">It must be considered that for many, the period of depression began before the 1930's, and their woes were simply exacerbated by the depressed economy following the crash. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.16">For those who reeled in the delights of 1920's prosperity, the effects of the Wall Street Crash would hit them hard. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.16">Those who found life easy throughout the 1920's, would find disaster the following decade, as the reality of a less secure, affluent life without readily available sources of cash would a prove hard stone to bear. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.8;p6.16">The Wall Street Crash of October 1929, a result of an over productive economy, a weak banking system, maldistribution of income and international economic problems, would prove a chaotic and ultimately devastating event, with repercussions felt all around the world. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.16">For those in American society who had yet to feel the hardships of unemployment, the decade that would follow would prove perilous. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.16">One case in point was that of the Ozment family. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.16">Robert Ozment's father, a well paid railway engineer, provided ample for his family, buying a house and investing in a family car during the 1920's. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.16">By 1933 the family was forced to live in the poorest section of town, losing all their valued possessions. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.16">This example mirrors countless others as the onset of the depression for previously prospering families was rapid and sharp. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.16">In 1995 historian Maldwyn A. Jones wrote, 'The Great Depression that began in the autumn of 1929 was the worst in American history......misery and want stalked the entire country." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0322g-ftnote.002"/>

<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.5;p7.16">Any account of depression era America should include basic facts and figures to highlight who exactly was forced to face the hardships of a greatly fractured economy. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.16">Unsurprisingly, such figures are not hard to come by. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.16">Due to overproduction, a decrease in demand, and the fact that thousands of industrial factories were forced out of business, urban families, who relied on a male breadwinner often found themselves with no source of income. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.16">By the autumn of 1931 unemployment had reached 8 million, and by 1933, approximately one quarter of the workforce of America was unemployed. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.16">As banks went out of business in their thousands, between 1929 and 1930, 9 million people lost their savings and a heavy decrease in the average weekly wage made this all the harder to bear, even for those who could find work. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.5;p8.16">Rich owners of major industrial companies such as Henry Ford were forced to lay off huge numbers as demand for their product decreased substantially. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p8.16">General Electric's net income fell from $60.5m in 1930 to $14.7m in 1932 as 'No men wanted' signs swiftly appeared in shop and factory windows. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p8.16">Despite the one-sidedness of this account thus far however, Robert S. McElvaine contends that the 'hard times' may not have been as especially hard for certain members of society. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p8.16">'Most of the rich remained quite comfortable...despite the myths of investors bodies piling knee-deep after they leaped from Wall Street windows...it was the desperate worker...who begged for a job." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0322g-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s5.5;p8.16">In 1929 the top 5% of the population had lived in extreme comfort, and while much of their 'paper money' may have vanished in the stock-market crash, their lives, in comparison to the majority of struggling Americans, can hardly be described as <hi rend="italic">hard</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p9.16">Hard times for rural America had begun well before the Wall Street Crash. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p9.16">Due to low domestic and international demand for basic crops, farm income was low, and remained low into the thirties. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p9.16">The farming industry failed to keep pace with urban manufacturers, especially since the growth of advertising. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p9.16">This great lack of rural income, far lower than the average required for farm families to live to an acceptable level, variably destroyed farmer purchasing power. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p9.16">Farmers and their families were forced to subsidize the living standards of everyone providing a nation's food supply at very low cost. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p9.16">Faced with industrial unemployment during the depression, mass mobilisation to urban centres was unadvisable, and established beliefs on the glory of the small farmer meant moving from rural regions was not an option for many. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p9.16">Farm families were forced to struggle, and hardships grew so bad in some regions that in the summer of 1932, militants organised the farm strike, venting anger at their continued woes. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p11.16">The study of African American hardships during the great depression has received great attention by historians, most notably in New Deal literature which stresses the unfortunate loss of farming land faced by rural blacks due to A.A.A. production cut- backs. </s>
