<s n="s1.2;p54.57">The reason for more women being involved in sport could perhaps be because the women have more of an impotence to join a local gym after a relationship in an effort, for example, to lose weight and feel better about ones self. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p54.57">However, with such a small difference between the values of the two sexes this is unlikely </s>

<p n="p55.57">
<s n="s1.3;p55.57">The reason for people being single could be attributed to the fact that they may be focused more on their jobs. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p55.57">Because of this their mean logarithm of monthly gross income would be higher than that of people who aren't single. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p55.57">However, this isn't the case. </s>

<p n="p56.57">
<s n="s1.1;p56.57">Regarding the actual number of single people in the new sample... </s>

<p n="p57.57">
<s n="s1.3;p57.57">Assuming that between the ages of 30 and 34 most people have married or have a long term partner, there is a rather high number of people who are single (40%). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p57.57">The mean age is 31.93 Years (Table 6) or 34.14 Years (Table 7) depending on sexes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p57.57">Although the modal values of 20 (Table 6) and 24 (Table 7) seem to support the idea that most common age is rather low I don't believe that the frequency of these ages (2 and 4 respectively) within the group is justifiable. </s>
