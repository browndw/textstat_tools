Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>

<s n="s3.7;p40.49">It is most common in those aged below 18 months (peak incidence 3-6 months), and for reasons that are currently unclear it is more common in males. </s>

<s n="s5.7;p40.49">In mild cases, the child improves; however, in some cases the condition progresses with increasing breathlessness, wheeze, cyanosis and pyrexia. on examination the child has rapid, laboured breathing, tachycardia, gross lung hyperinflation producing a barrel-shaped chest, prominent neck veins and downward displacement of the liver. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p40.49">Auscultation reveals widespread wheeze and crepitations over both lung fields. </s>
