<s n="s1.3;p1.26">This experiment covered some of the growth kinetics, for which the growth curve of <hi rend="italic">Serratia</hi> <hi rend="italic">marcescens</hi> was determined by measuring the absorbance using a spectrophotometer of the culture growing in a side-arm flask at 10 minute intervals during incubation at 37°C in a shaking water bath. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.26">As a result, the Lag Phase began from 0 min to 10 min, the Acceleration Phase began from 10 min to 20 min, then there was 90 min (20 min - 110 min) Exponential Growth Phase, after which the growth began to slow down (Retardation Phase) and finally entered the (Stationary Phase) at about 140 minutes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.26">The specific growth rate "µ" was calculated as 1.02 hour <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>, and the culture doubling time "t <hi rend="sub">d</hi>" was calculated as 0.68 hour. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p17.26">The lag phase of the growth curve was not very long, because that this bacterium <hi rend="italic">Serratia marcescens</hi> reacts rapidly to the environmental conditions. </s>

<p n="p18.26">
<s n="s1.2;p18.26">The Acceleration Phase was short indeed, which indicated that the cells within the population began to grow at similar, though natural heterogeneity still present. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.26">During this phase, the cells of the population began to divide and enter their maximum growth rate at similar time, once the maximum growth rate is achieved, the cell will keep growing at this rate until the conditions are no longer favorable. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.26">
<s n="s1.3;p19.26">During the Exponential Growth Phase, the increasing of the number of the cell was extremely fast, that was one of the reasons that a semi-log graph was used to draw the growth curve. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p19.26">In this phase, the specific growth rate was determined as the increase in bacterial biomass per existing unit of biomass per unit of time, and the culture doubling time "t <hi rend="sub">d</hi>" was calculated as 0.68 hour (40.8 minutes), very close to the expectation of 40 minutes.
