<div2>
<head rend="italic">Static element:</head>
<p n="p12.29">
<s n="s1.3;p12.29">The main idea of the architecture of the SVG code is to define each static element (including the postman, girl, husband and the car) in a <hi rend="italic">&lt;defs>

</hi> tag to use this element. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p14.29">The wheel is also include in a <hi rend="italic">&lt;defs>

<s n="s1.2;p22.29">Each animation concerning the place of an element in the scene (e.g.: x, y, width,...attributes) are made in the second part (so the <hi rend="italic">animate</hi> tag will carry out on the <hi rend="italic">&lt;use>
</hi> part), whereas when an animation has to change an element which is included in another element (e.g.: a wheel is included in the car), this animation is made in the definition part (the first part). </s>

<s n="s1.5;p26.29">The postman/girl/husband motion: the legs motions (and arms motions) are defined in the first part of the SVG file by an <hi rend="italic">animateTransform</hi> tag (rotate) and the translation of the human (postman/girl/husband) is made is the second part. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p26.29">The postman/husband translation is made with an <hi rend="italic">animationMotion</hi> tag, so they can follow a path. </s>
