<s n="s3.5;p2.33">The best of the leads is nominated as a candidate drug (CD) and is taken forward into PR&amp;D. However, as Figure 2 shows a developing drug will spend a very large amount of time in PR&amp;D. This is because even the most promising of drugs cannot be marketed without a viable manufacturing process. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p3.33">From the production of this material important knowledge is then acquired. </s>

<p n="p4.33">
<s n="s1.11;p4.33">At AstraZeneca PR&amp;D is divided into five sections: process chemistry (PC), process analysis (PA), development manufacture (DM), process engineering (PE), and process management (PM). </s>

<s n="s3.11;p4.33">The route must be robust, safe and predictable for manufacture, but ideally it should also be simple, inexpensive and environmentally benign, as well as high yielding with high quality<ref target="BAWE_0388b-endnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.33">PA is responsible for developing analytical methods to assess the quality of the API and its intermediates. </s>

<s n="s6.11;p4.33">PA and PC can use this information to set specifications for the API. DM is concerned with the running of the pilot plant to produce large quantities of API. It works closely with PC to ensure the route is compatible with the intended site of use. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.33">PE concentrates on plant compatibility and the resolution of scale issues. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.33">Issues can arise with agitation, heat or mass transfer and isolation when scaled larger, which are all key to manufacture. </s>
