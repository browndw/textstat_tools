<s n="s5.10;p2.6">Small molecules with permanent dipole moments interact with microwave energy in the gas phase. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.6">In the dipole polarisation mechanism the frequency of irradiation is such that the molecular dipoles respond by rotating to the alternating electric field. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.6">That is the molecules align their dipoles with the external field, and energy is lost by molecular friction and random collisions, generating dielectric heating. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.6">The ionic conduction mechanism is the movement of ions under the influence of the electric field, and the kinetic energy involved is released as heat through an increased in the collision rate (see figure 2). </s>

<s n="s2.10;p3.6">The simplest method of microwave heating involves irradiation of reactants only in an open container. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p3.6">This is similar to classical reflux but with increased reaction rates. </s>

<s n="s6.10;p3.6">A solvent is chosen with dielectric properties which is suitable for coupling microwave energy and rapid heating to temperatures which are about 20-30ËšC below boiling point. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p3.6">However this technique is limited to high-boiling polar solvents and isolation of product from these solvents can be difficult. </s>

<s n="s9.10;p3.6">This occurs when a liquid is heated to a temperature higher than its standard boiling point, without actually boiling. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Advantages of microwave heating over conventional thermal heating</head>
<p n="p4.6">
<s n="s1.8;p4.6">Microwave irradiation has several advantages compared to conventional thermal heating of reactants. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p4.6">Conventional thermal heating usually involves the use of a furnace or oil bath, which heats the walls of the reactor by convection or conduction. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.6">The core of the sample takes much longer to achieve the desired temperature and as a result the sample is not heated uniformly as with microwave heating. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.6">Energy is also wasted in heating the furnace or oil bath. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.6">The introduction of microwave energy into a chemical reaction which has at least one component which can couple with the microwaves can lead to much higher heating rates compared with conventional heating. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.6">As microwave energy is introduced into the sample remotely, there is no direct contact between the energy source and the sample. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.6">Microwave dielectric heating resembles a flash heating process where the energy is produced much more rapidly and the sample cools more rapidly at the end of the reaction. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.6">This leads to very different temperature-time profiles compared with conventional heating which may lead to significantly different products. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="underlined">Use of Microwave assisted organic synthesis</head>
<p n="p5.6">
<s n="s1.8;p5.6">Several organic synthesis reactions have been reported in the literature to have increased reaction rates when subjected to microwave irradiation<ref target="BAWE_0389c-endnote.009"/>-<ref target="BAWE_0389c-endnote.010"/>, one of which is the synthesis of an 1-aryl-1H-indazole via a one-pot two-step copper mediated system (see figure 1)<ref target="BAWE_0389c-endnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p5.6">The reaction was carried out as a test to determine if using microwave irradiation would produce the product in sufficient yield and shorten the reaction time. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.6">This reaction involved heating an aldehyde (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>) and a hydrazine (<hi rend="bold">2</hi>) in a sealed reactor for 10 mins at 160ËšC in the microwave. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p5.6">This forms an intermediate arylhydrazone (<hi rend="bold">3</hi>) which after further heating at 160ËšC for 10 mins facilitates the cyclisation to forms the desired 1-aryl-1H-indazole (<hi rend="bold">4</hi>) upon addition of potassium carbonate, copper iodide and a ligand. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p5.6">The reported yields of similar reactions were approximately 85%<hi rend="sup">11</hi> however upon carrying out the reaction with aldehyde (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>) and hydrazine (<hi rend="bold">2</hi>) the yield obtained was a disappointing 22%. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p5.6">This may be due to the fact that different substrates were used and further work to optimise the microwave conditions could be carried out along with further comparisons with conventional heating in order to improve this yield. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.6">The poor yield could also be due to purification issues of the product which could also be optimised in order to improve the yield. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.6">The reaction time was decreased however, as using conventional heating the reaction could be up to several hours compared with 20 mins heating in the microwave. </s>
