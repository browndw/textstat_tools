<s n="s1.5;p1.41">Prof. Mel Rosenberg spent more than a decade researching a mouthwash that can remove bad breath effectively. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.41">In 1992, his prototype two-phase aqueous-oil mouthwash was tested with Listerine, one of the biggest mouthrinse brands and was proved that its special formulated mouthwash is superior to Listerine in long-term reduction of bad breath. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.41">In 1996, Philip Stemmer acquired the right to introduce that special mouthwash to Britain and he set up a separate company, <hi rend="bold">Fresh Breath</hi>, to introduce this special mouthwash to the British market. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.41">The resulted product, <hi rend="bold">Dentyl pH,</hi> dominates <hi rend="bold">7% of the British market</hi> and <hi rend="bold">its sales will reach £3m.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.41">No doubt that Fresh Breath has a very healthy income through the sales of <hi rend="bold">Dentyl pH</hi> but now they have the ambition to enter a much bigger market- a market that has sales of 280m altogether a year. </s>

<p n="p2.41">

<head rend="bold">Market Future</head>

<s n="s1.5;p4.41">British toothpaste market has a very promising future as in the last 20 years, people in the UK are willing to spend more on toiletries according to surveys and most of the people put quality before price nowadays. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.41">When it comes to toothpaste, consumers compare functions of different brands rather than prices. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.41">Using Colgate, the biggest toothpaste brand worldwide, as an example, they have 3% increases every year in terms of unit volume grew in the past 8 years. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.41">In their 2003 annual report, their sale is reported to have grown up by 16% in the United Kingdom. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p32.41">Lots of other toothpaste out in the market has claimed to be 'breath-freshening' and some of them even claim to be able to fight off bacterial growth up to 12 hours. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p32.41">Without a distinctive function, its unlikely for a new toothpaste brand becomes successful as its reputation is unknown in that area. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p32.41">Since Fresh Breath does not have any reputation in this area, it has to be 'specific' and be the first no. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p32.41">1 over specific segments so customers can always remember. </s>

<hi rend="bold italic">'In most cases, it is so much harder to remember the No. 2. No one remembers the name of the second person in space. But most Indians remember that name of the first Indian in space, although he was the nth person in space'</hi> quoted from Samit Sinha, COO, Mudra Communications. </quote>
<p n="p33.41">
<s n="s1.2;p33.41">Therefore, to do well in the toothpaste market, further research has to be done to make the toothpaste stand out. </s>

<p n="p34.41">
<s n="s1.6;p34.41">Patenting the new formula would protect other companies using the new formula. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p34.41">It may also need to trademark a slogan that describes the new formulated toothpaste; to describe it is the best toothpaste. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p34.41">A good slogan could capture customers' memory subconsciously. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p34.41">Like Carlsberg's beer's slogan 'Probably the best beer in the world' captures so many people memories. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p34.41">Whether Carlsberg is the best beer in the world is not important, they are successful and that is what they want out of their slogan. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p34.41">A patented distinctive formula and a stand-out trademarked slogan would put Fresh Breath in a very good position in the market. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p35.41">Fresh Breath has already had a basic structure of a company and it can be divided further. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p35.41">Each member of new staff could be given a more specific role in the company and that would increase the efficiency of the company and lower the work load of the old staff. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p35.41">People whose works are similar and related could be grouped together as a department headed by a member of our old staff who is specialised in that certain area. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p35.41">Advertising and marketing experts who have experience are also worth consideration as their contacts in the industry, experience and knowledge could be proved crucial. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Manufacturing</head>
<p n="p36.41">
<s n="s1.7;p36.41">Fresh Breath should carry as a virtual company i.e. not manufacturing products themselves. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p36.41">This would provide an easier exit strategy and easier start-up. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p36.41">Buying manufacturing assets would be unwise as they would cause a lot of money and would be hard to resell when Fresh Breath want to exit the market. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p36.41">To start off with, Fresh Breath should order a certain amount of stocks as this is used as a test and would not waste too much money if the product is found unsuccessful. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p36.41">Fresh Breath bargaining power is weak according to Porter's Five Force as they are small-scaled. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p36.41">To encounter this problem, Fresh Breath could order stocks from China, the biggest manufacturing country, as this would provide a cheaper option and Fresh Breath could even make a huge profit over the currency exchange as china has been refusing to raise the value of Yenminbi despite American urges. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p37.41">As a new comer in a highly competitive market, it is important that the brand quickly establish its presence. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.41">Using the old contacts in the industry and experience of the team, it is hoped that the new toothpaste would be able to make a breakthrough and companies would start stocking the new product. </s>

<p n="p38.41">
<s n="s1.5;p38.41">This should be followed right after entering the market. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p38.41">Once negotiations with companies willing to stock the new toothpaste start, marketing campaign should begin. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p38.41">The launch strategy should focus on the new patented toothpaste's striking point of difference and the slogan supporting the product. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p38.41">Most of the £2million budget should be spent on television advertising campaign, which is by far the most effective way to advertise products. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p39.41">Part of the income from Dentyl pH will be used to advertise mouthwash and the rest would be used to carry on further research on toothpaste. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p39.41">It does not necessarily have to be researching new functions or improving the toothpaste formula. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p39.41">It could be testing toothpaste of other brands and find out their weakness and then publish the test results. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p39.41">With Philip Stemmer's recognition, reputation and influence in the industry, the test report would cause serious damage on our rivalry brands. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Licensing the formula/ Franchising </head>
<p n="p40.41">
<s n="s1.6;p40.41">If the toothpaste becomes successful in the market, Fresh Breath could be able to pay off the loan and start planning how long they are willing to stay in the market. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p40.41">There is no industry that keeps growing forever and big rival companies like Colgate would not just sit and give up their interest in the UK market. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p40.41">Competition could not be avoided. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p40.41">Fresh Breath could think about licensing the patented formula to other brands outside the country as this would increase the cashflow without benefiting any of the rival companies. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p40.41">Or they could franchise the company outside UK. This would not only increase Fresh Breath cashflow by selling the patented formula at a higher price to them but also expand our influence in the toothpaste market outside the country. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Exit the industry</head>
<p n="p41.41">
<s n="s1.11;p41.41">Fresh Breath as a virtual company would find it hard to compete against their big rivals. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p41.41">As directors remain committed to their own business interests and their rival companies market value are worth 100-1000 times more than Fresh Breath, it may be the time to think about exiting the industry after making a huge profit. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p41.41">Like gambling, the longer you stay the biggest the chance you will lose money. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p41.41">There are many risks that have to be taken in toothpaste industry like making a crucial mistake. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p41.41">Since the directors are not willing to give up their own business interests and concentrate on the growth of Fresh Breath, the future of Fresh Breath at this stage is very unclear. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p41.41">Exiting is probably the best option and we would recommend selling off most of the shares to new buyers. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p41.41">Directors would receive a huge amount of one-off money from the sale plus they would still be benefited from further growth of the company. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p41.41">Moreover, they could concentrate on their own business duties without worrying about the future of Fresh Breath. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p41.41">Or they could sell of the formula of both the toothpaste and mouthwash to other brands and end the business of Fresh Breath if there are no buyers as the price of buying off the company would be too high. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p41.41">This would bring the whole business to an end and directors would expect a smaller one off payment from the sale of the formulas of the mouthwash and toothpaste. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p41.41">This move is not recommended unless Fresh Breath business is going down sharply and any delay in exiting the market would cause a big loss of money. </s>
