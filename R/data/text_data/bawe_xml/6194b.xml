<s n="s3.3;p2.23">Each forcing can be applied with a scaling factor to modify its effect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.23">
<s n="s1.4;p3.23">The model calculates the combined forcing for each year between 1850 and 2006, and from this the temperature anomaly relative to the 1961 - 1990 average and also relative to the 1850 - 1879 average (In this exercise the 1961 - 1990 average will be used for all comparisons). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.23">The equilibrium temperature change for the relevant forcing at each year is also calculated. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.23">The model produces plots of the combined radiative forcings, the global mean temperature anomaly relative to the two stated time periods, with each plotted alongside the observed temperature anomaly, and also the model vs equilibrium temperature change for each year. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p4.23">For all these different combinations the climate feedback parameter Y was left constant at a mid-range value of 1.3 Wm <hi rend="sup">-2</hi>K <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>. </s>

<p n="p5.23">
<s n="s1.4;p5.23">With only the well-mixed greenhouse gas forcing switched on the temperature anomaly rises slowly at first then more rapidly from the 1960's onwards. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.23">The temperature change is too great over the whole period, with the anomaly being slightly too high from 1970 onwards, and substantially too low for most of the preceding time. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.23">The increase is steady, with none of the small scale fluctuations that are seen in the observed data. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.23">The rate of increase after about 1960 is similar to that in the observed data. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.23">
<s n="s1.5;p6.23">Adding all other anthropogenic forcings except the indirect aerosol effect has only a small effect. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p6.23">However, the fit is slightly improved, particularly from 1950 onwards. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p6.23">If the indirect aerosol is also included the fit worsens again, with the temperature anomaly becoming too high until 1940, and too low in the years after 1995. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p6.23">The well mixed GHG's have the most effect of all anthropogenic factors; removing them causes the temperature anomaly to fall steadily throughout the whole time period. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.23">See Figure 1. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.23">
<s n="s1.3;p7.23">The natural forcings, from solar fluctuations and volcanic eruptions, provide more small-timescale effects, with no overall trend through the time period. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.23">The smaller fluctuations do not seem to fit very closely with the fluctuations in the observed data. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.23">The negative anomalies due to volcanic activity are too large in several cases. </s>

<p n="p9.23">
<s n="s1.7;p9.23">From these results it seems that the most likely major source of the increase in temperature over the past fifty years is the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.23">The upward trend in the temperature over this period is captured quite well in the model when including this forcing, and not at all when the forcing is removed. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.23">The shorter timescale variations in the observations are not well represented in the model. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.23">The cooling effect of volcanic eruptions appears to be overestimated. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.23">This could be partly explained by the model's lack of random internal variability. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.23">In the real world, random climate variability could have acted to mask some of the effects of volcanic eruptions. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.23">It still seems likely, however, that there is too much weight given to the volcanic forcing in the model. </s>
