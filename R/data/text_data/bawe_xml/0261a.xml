<s n="s1.12;p1.11">The change of dynasty in Spain at the turn of the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century from Habsburg to Bourbon became a significant milestone for the future of Spanish America. </s>

<s n="s3.12;p1.11">Spain's weak economical and military situation, the Treaty of Utrecht<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.001"/> in 1713 and the <hi rend="italic">Noticias secretas de America</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.002"/> forced the Bourbons to reassess the aims and methods of the Spanish imperial government. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p1.11">This undoubtedly led to the formation of the Bourbon Reforms, which aimed to modernize the Spanish economy, society and institutions. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p1.11">Due to the direct relationship between metropolis and colony all reforms and changes adopted in Spain were transferred to Latin America. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p1.11">However the modifications applied by the Bourbons challenged the traditional and conservative status quo of the colony much to the anger of the three main power groups: the administration, the Church and the Creole elite. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p1.11">The transformations put into operation had been aimed not only to bring complete political and economical control of the colony under the Spanish monarchy but most importantly to benefit the metropolis. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p1.11">However ironically, the discontent and resentment with the enlightened absolutism resulted in rise of nationalistic feelings as the various regional populations developed a strong sense of regional identity. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p1.11">According to Stoetzer "the Bourbon reforms [...] opened the gates for the future revolution in the Indies"<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.003"/> as they had formed the basis of nationalism, which at the turn of the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century was one of the main driving motors for the call of independent states in Spanish America. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p1.11">However bearing in mind the political situation around the globe was not nationalism a natural and evolutionary product of the enlightened era? </s>
<s n="s11.12;p1.11">During the second half of the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century both the American and French revolutions occurred therefore could have Spanish America just caught the "nationalistic fever"? </s>
<s n="s12.12;p1.11">The degree of the Bourbon reforms influence on the colony may be over exaggerated thus what other factors could have helped establishing the basis for nationalism and nation states. </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">A concession was necessary so that Philip of Anjou would be recognized as the new monarch of Spain by his enemies, therefore: the Flanders and Italian dominations were granted to Austria and Savoy, Portugal could retain the Colonia do Sacramento smuggling center on the River Plate, whilst Great Britain preserved Gibraltar and Minorca and the right to supply African slaves to the Spanish Indies. </s>

<s n="s2.3;pn1.1">The document criticized the situation in the colony and depicted it in a very grim manner by exaggerating the faults of the Spanish rule and devaluing the benefits provided by the Church and the missionaries work. </s>
<s n="s3.3;pn1.1">It was detested by Spanish America and provided the Spanish crown with an excuse to strike against the Church and the Creole elites, which was intrinsically foreign to the criollos idealism. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p2.11">Mainly Jose de Galvez, who had been on a number of <hi rend="italic">visitas generales</hi> and so was well aware of the state of the colonies, had crafted the reforms programme. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.11">To Galvez it was the state of Spain, which was more important than the colony therefore the disproval of Creoles and elites, was not taken into account. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.11">After close study of the reforms it seemed that they all clashed with the Latin American way of life. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.11">There were a series of new administrative changes, which included the establishment of the new viceroyalty of New Granada in 1740 and the viceroyalty of the River Plate in 1776. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.11">These new administrative subdivisions resulted in a massive shift in the economic orientation from the Pacific to the Atlantic, as the silver mining trade route, based in Upper Peru, was made more efficient. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.11">However at the same time the numerous local economies were dislocated and but more importantly the reform "encroached the Hispanic concept of freedom"<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.005"/> as the main industries were in Bourbon control. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p4.11">This was a French administrative institution, which was a reaction to the decentralisation of the Habsburgs, which was aimed to correct the anarchy, modernise the Latin administration and end the alleged abuses of Indians. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p4.11">This institution was a symbol of the French spirit of order, which contrasted to the Spanish American one, and it also replaced the <hi rend="italic">corregidores</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">alcaldes mayores</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">penisulares</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p4.11">This great political error caused the crown to make unnecessary enemies as the Creoles were discriminated against as all the administrative vacancies were filled by <hi rend="italic"> penisulares,</hi> resulting in the Creoles loss of control. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.11">The institution was successful for a brief period in the finance and military field, however it backfired at the turn of the century since it had reawakened the political consciousness of <hi rend="italic">cabildos</hi> as it had ironically increased their self-assurance. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p4.11">There was resistance towards the Spanish tutelage as the Creoles in the River Plate, Cordoba and La Paz called for the defense of municipal freedoms. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.12;p5.11">The Bourbons wanted to better utilise the Indies via the development of the wealth and growth of population. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s3.12;p5.11">Consequently as the Bourbons advocated and implemented the <hi rend="italic">un comercio libre y protegido</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.007"/> the production, trade, working conditions and the distribution of capital improved. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p5.11">New areas of trade where open to colonial centres as Buenos Aires, Caracas, Cartagena and Havana could trade with other ports in Spain. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p5.11">However it was against some of the monopolistic positions of the Spanish American merchants who had greatly benefited from the monopoly of Cadiz and Seville. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p5.11">Furthermore it was the existence of the Spanish policy of an interventionist state where an artificial economic exchange continued between Spain and Indies that infuriated the Creoles the most. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p5.11">Other sectors of society "exacerbated anti-Spanish resentment"<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.008"/> due to the various taxes and tariffs placed on the entire population. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p5.11">Indians, Creoles and the clergy were all harassed to "donate" to the Crown, whilst also suffering the dreaded <hi rend="italic">alcabala</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p5.11">Merchants were banned from trading with other nations, however their discontent was so zealous that free trade was allowed in 1789. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0261a-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s11.12;p5.11">The fact that the state had to give in to Creole demands represented the slowly diminishing Spanish control and correspondingly the increasing self-awareness of the Creole population. </s>

<s n="s5.14;p8.11">The revolt collapsed in 1782 due to the disunity among Indians and their lack of national identity. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p8.11">The conspiracies of the 3 Antonios of Chile in 1780-1781 and the Revolt of Comuneros in New Granada in 1781 were both rooted in republicanism and foreshadowed political independence and enabled the spread of revolutionary ideas. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p8.11">The plot of Gual and Espana in Venezuela in 1797 aimed to bring liberty to Spanish America and be linked to Spain only on the basis of language and history. </s>

<s n="s9.14;p8.11">His call for a united and independent Spanish America was unpopular since there was a strong sense of regional identity due to the oligarchies. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p8.11">The British invasions of River Plate in 1806-1807 were highly significant as it gave birth to Argentinean nationalism and the citizens took matters into their own hands by abolishing the viceroy and defeating the British. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p10.11">Spanish America was characterised by rivalry and competition not on co-operation hence the Creoles realised the differences among themselves and considered themselves either Mexicans, Venezuelans, Peruvians depending on their region. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p11.11">The Enlightened absolutism changed the relations between the power groups at the expense of the private sector as local elites interpreted the Bourbon "rational development" as an attack on their interests. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.11">The new abolitionism was very unpopular among all social groups and forced them to decide whether to reach for political power in order to prevent further instalments of enlightened legislation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.11">The Bourbon reforms removed the legitimacy of royal authority in eyes of the Church, Creoles, Indians and common people, therefore they embarked on the belief that problems could be solved by autonomous decisions. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.11">Nationalism seems to have sprouted from the hate of the Bourbon reforms as elites and clergy united against a common threat. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.11">The major political upheavals in Europe and the ideas of liberty and equality seem to have only strengthened the Spanish American self-awareness and sense of national pride. </s>
