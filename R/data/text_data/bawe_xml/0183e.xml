<s n="s1.4;p8.45">The piezoelectric nature of quartz was first discovered by Pierre and Jacques Currie in 1880 when certain crystals polarise when subjected to an applied force. </s>

<head rend="bold">The Piezoelectric effect</head>
<p n="p9.45">
<s n="s1.7;p9.45">It is the ability of certain crystals to generate voltage when subjected to a mechanical stress. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p9.45">In a piezoelectric crystal the positive and negative charges are symmetrically distributed, so that the crystal is overall electrically neutral. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p9.45">Each of these sites forms domains which are randomly oriented but align during poling. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p9.45">When a mechanical stress is applied the symmetry is disturbed and the charge asymmetry produces a voltage across the material. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p9.45">For applications in electronics, the piezoelectric effect is used to convert electrical energy into acoustic wave energy and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p9.45">Information carried by the surface acoustic waves along the surface of a crystal substrate may be processed during propagation. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p9.45">The most common processing techniques involve either the time delay of the signal, which depends on the geometry of the device and the acoustic velocity, or the amplitude of the signal which can be varied or "weighted" by controlling the efficiency of the piezoelectric transduction. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p10.45">A typical SAW device contains two such IDTs, one as input transducer, the other as output transducer to convert the SAW back to the electrical domain, e.g. delay or filtering. </s>

<s n="s3.13;p11.45">In this case since it operates in a passive wireless mode the IDT connects directly to an antenna called the device antenna. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p11.45">The function of this antenna is to convert microwave signal from the air to saw signal on the wafer surface and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p11.45">A frequency modulated signal generator is used as a reading system with a system antenna that transmits these signals. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p11.45">These Fm signals are then received by the device antenna and converted by the antenna-IDT to SAW waves which propagate along the piezoelectric wafer which in this case is Lithium Niobate. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p11.45">The echoes from the two reflectors are picked up by the antenna IDT and sent back to the system antenna. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p11.45">These echo signals are nothing but the delayed copies of the transmitted FM signal. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p11.45">This delay time depends on the velocity at which the SAW wave propagates and the distance between the IDT and reflectors. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p11.45">A mixer which takes the transmitted FM as a reference signal, outputs the signals of frequency difference between the reflected and transmitted signal is linearly FM, the frequency shift is proportional to the time delay. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p11.45">The time delay depends on the saw velocity, which is sensitive to the ambient temperature. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p11.45">However changes in time delay with respect to temperature is very small; the phase shifts are taken into consideration which is more sensitive than frequency. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p11.45">Hence temperature is determined by the difference in phase shifts of the two IFs corresponding to the two reflectors </s>
