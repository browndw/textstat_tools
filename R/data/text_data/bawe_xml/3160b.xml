<hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi> is a classical Gothic film of the 1940s. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.37">Its narrative structure and visual style correspond with the characteristics of classical cinema. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.37">In this essay I will carry out a close textual analysis of the ball scene in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film in relation to the theory of mise-en-sc√®ne and its adherence to the techniques of narration in Classical Hollywood Cinema. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p2.37">The Van Ryn's celebrate a ball at Dragonwyck castle. </s>

</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Narrative structure</head>
<p n="p3.37">
<s n="s1.9;p3.37">Classical Hollywood Cinema has a linear narrative structure which holds to the pattern: equilibrium-disequilibrium-new equilibrium. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.37">Sequences and scenes are generally moulded like the whole film; this order is evident in the film <hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi> and also in this particular scene. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.37">The scene begins with Miranda walking through the ballroom observing what is around her and trying to find her place. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.37">After a brief encounter with a French man, Miranda advances into an adjacent room and sits with the young women there. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.37">Their conversation starts amicably but the women's superior attitude belittles and insults Miranda. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.37">The new equilibrium is reached when Nicholas comforts Miranda and flatters her, telling her how "beautiful" she looks and how she is so "much better" than the other girls, and finally dancing with her. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.37">Nicholas solves the situation and restores the equilibrium. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.37">This scene respects classical narrative conventions and, furthermore, epitomises the linear narrative structure of Classical Hollywood Cinema. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.37">The different parts of the narrative pattern can be clearly identified and differentiated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.37">
<s n="s1.4;p4.37">The two protagonists of <hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi> are present during this scene and the main features of their personalities conveyed. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.37">The growing relationship between Miranda and Nicholas is apparent and the protagonists' interaction, and other characters' reactions, predicts their future. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.37">The way in which Nicholas saves Miranda and cheers her up proves his role as the Gothic male. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.37">His bold and domineering qualities stand out as he talks to Miranda and dances with her in front of the whole room. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.37">
<s n="s1.4;p5.37">Miranda is the heroine in <hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi> and is portrayed as young and innocent in this scene. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.37">Miranda's naivety takes her to sit with the group of women believing she can engage in casual conversation with them, she talks about Connecticut and tries to fit in but ends up hurt because she is not good enough. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.37">The way in which she withdraws proves her childishness as she storms out raising her voice. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.37">She is anxious to hear Nicholas say she looks beautiful and forces him to say so, this infantile behaviour matches her personality and role as a Gothic heroine. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.37">
<s n="s1.3;p6.37">There is always an antagonist who opposes the protagonists. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.37">In this specific scene, the antagonists would be the women who despise Miranda. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.37">They laugh at her humble origins and gossip while she dances with Nicholas at the end of the scene. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.37">
<s n="s1.5;p7.37">The narrative structure in classical Hollywood cinema follows a cause-effect chain of events which can be applied to this scene as follows: Miranda lives at Dragonwyck and likes dancing, consequently, she attends the ball. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.37">Miranda wants to fit in at the dance therefore, she talks to the group of women but, the women are posh and Miranda is not, so they are rude to her. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.37">As Miranda is hurt, she runs away. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.37">Nicholas sees the incident and comes after her; he likes Miranda and wants to comfort her hence, he invites her to dance. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.37">Miranda accepts his offer because she is attracted to him. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.37">
<s n="s1.3;p8.37">In classical Hollywood cinema, the chain of events stems from the protagonist's actions and the protagonist's desire precipitates the story. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p8.37">This does not translate perfectly to <hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi> as Nicholas' desire for an heir stirs the story rather than solely Miranda. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p8.37">In this scene, however, the events are triggered by Miranda's desire to belong in Dragonwyck and her actions throughout the scene. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.37">
<s n="s1.3;p9.37">The combination of unrestricted and subjective narration can be appreciated in this scene. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.37">The spectator accompanies Miranda and experiences the events from her point of view sharing her judgment, such as when she walks into the room to sit with the other women. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.37">Even though there are no point of view shots, the spectator sees the group of girls just after Miranda looks out of the frame in the previous shot, therefore, the spectator is inclined to identify with the heroine. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.37">
<s n="s1.4;p10.37">The film also makes use of unrestricted narration with the effect of causing suspense and dramatic irony. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.37">The spectator sees Nicholas observing Miranda from behind the door but she does not know that Nicholas is watching her (Fig. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p10.37">1), therefore, the audience can expect Nicholas to go after Miranda when she leaves. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p10.37">When the couple is outside, Nicholas asks Miranda if she is enjoying the ball, the spectator knows Nicholas' question is only strategic as he has been observing her. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.37">
<s n="s1.2;p11.37">The use of unrestricted narration in this scene creates suspense, while the spectator waits to see how Nicholas approaches Miranda, and also dramatic irony as Miranda appreciates Nicholas' empathy and care without being aware of him having seen everything. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.37">The use of shot-countershot makes this happen as the spectator sees what the protagonists see and also receives the extra information to move up in the hierarchy of knowledge. </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_3160b-pic.001">
<head>Fig.1 Nicholas observing Miranda in <hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi> (1946)</head>
</figure>
<p n="p12.37">
<s n="s1.3;p12.37">This scene also fulfils another characteristic of Classical Hollywood Cinema, it has a strong sense of closure. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.37">The new equilibrium the narrative reaches when Nicholas consoles Miranda, seals the scene and wraps up the story for the spectator. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.37">The fade out emphasises the closure and aids the transition to the next scene which contrasts with this optimistic ending. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Visual style </head>
<p n="p13.37">
<s n="s1.4;p13.37">Classical Hollywood Cinema attempts to create a realistic sensation in its films. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.37">There is a natural flow and pace as events take place in this scene of <hi rend="italic">Dragonwyck</hi>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.37">The continuity editing system classical films put in practice serves to keep this genuineness through its unobtrusive way of joining the action. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.37">I will study the scene's visual style to explore how the technical elements are applied to this effect. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.37">
<s n="s1.7;p14.37">The scene opens with an establishing shot of the ballroom and people dancing to situate the spectator (Fig. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p14.37">2). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p14.37">Then the film moves on to the protagonist, the camera tracks Miranda's movement to the two-shot with the French man. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p14.37">After their short conversation, the shot is not cut immediately as the spectator sees Miranda walk away. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p14.37">This grants realism because she moves naturally from one place to another; it gives the film continuity and also a sense of space. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p14.37">Tracking builds on the natural flow of the action such as when the protagonist moves away from the housekeeper and the camera pursues her as she goes outside. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p14.37">This movement is also symbolic now that it emphasises that Miranda is turning away from the ball and the people. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p15.37">The abundant use of tracking helps maintain the pace, the characters set the rhythm and the camera complies with their actions. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p15.37">This use of the camera adds to the subjective narration of the scene. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p15.37">When Nicholas and Miranda are outside, she turns away from Nicholas at a certain point and Nicholas moves towards her. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p15.37">The shot is not cut, the camera follows their motions providing the action with continuity. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p15.37">When they start dancing to go back inside the camera imitates their movements and seems to be dancing with them, therefore, it acquires the tempo and gestures of the characters (Fig. </s>

</p>
<p n="p17.37">
<s n="s1.5;p17.37">Match on action is used throughout the scene to ensure a fluid rhythm. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.37">In the shot with the French man, the spectator has seen Miranda move out of the frame and then re-enter again smoothly. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.37">When the heroine leaves the room with the women, match on action leads on to the next shot once again where the housekeeper talks to Miranda; this gives the sensation that the spectator is trailing Miranda in real time (Fig. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.37">4). </s>

<s n="s1.5;p18.37">A variety of shots is used in this scene. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p18.37">Alternating wide and medium shots drives the spectator to focus on different aspects or situations. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p18.37">When Miranda steps into the room with the women, a medium shot obliges the spectator to focus on her expression and see how something attracts her attention. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p18.37">A wide shot of the three women sitting and talking conveys what Miranda was looking at and where she is making her way to. </s>

</p>
<p n="p19.37">
<s n="s1.4;p19.37">The camera also zooms out to offer a wide shot of the four women, this serves to show how Miranda is surrounded and cornered by the others (Fig. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.37">5). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.37">When Miranda suddenly gets up, a wide shot of the room lets the spectator see that the other people in the room are aware of her raising her voice to the women (Fig. </s>

<s n="s2.2;p20.37">Before returning to a medium shot of the couple to hear them talking in a smaller frame, a tracking of one of the guests leads the camera to a medium shot of Johanna so that the spectator sees her reaction in particular, concerned by seeing her husband with their daughter's companion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.37">
<s n="s1.4;p21.37">The use of shot/countershot and the respect of the eye line match, shows the interaction between characters when Miranda speaks with the other women. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p21.37">It is relevant to highlight the medium shot of Nicholas behind the door which permits the spectator see him looking at Miranda. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p21.37">He is also looking down, hence abiding by the eye line match. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p21.37">This keeps the continuity of the scene and the realism as the shots match the natural conversation. </s>

<p n="p22.37">
<s n="s1.6;p22.37">On the other hand, the use of two-shot also stands out in this scene. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p22.37">When Miranda is outside, a wide shot lets the spectator see Nicholas arrive. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.37">This shot places the protagonists in context for the spectator and then passes to a more intimate two-shot (Fig. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.37">7). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.37">This smaller frame permits the action to only focus on the couple and the attraction between them. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p24.37">The spectator recognises the room as Dragonwyck, the two wide shots offer different perspectives of the room and the decorations change its appearance, the place looks fancy and pompous. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.37">The fact that everyone is dancing and that there is an orchestra obviously places the spectator at one of the balls Nicholas mentions earlier in the film. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.37">The setting changes when Miranda walks outside. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p24.37">This setting acquires a symbolic significance, the change emphasises that Miranda and Nicholas are alone, together, and detached from everyone else. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.37">
<s n="s1.5;p25.37">The different shot sizes varies what is stressed in each frame, the wide shots want the spectator to focus on the surroundings and the atmosphere while the smaller frames want the spectator to centre on the characters, therefore, the performances. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p25.37">The last shots of the scene are symbolically charged as the spectator watches Nicholas and Miranda waltz into the ballroom and metaphorically push away all the other characters. </s>
