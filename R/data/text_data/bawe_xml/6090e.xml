<p n="p1.58">
<s n="s1.4;p1.58">Ferrocene, otherwise known as bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron (II), was discovered in 1951 and since then there has been a vast increase in the amount of complexes containing aromatic ligands such as the cyclopentadienyl anion that are bound to a metal. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.58">The termed aromaticity is best described using Huckels rules for aromaticity, which are that a considered molecule is aromatic if it is flat (planar), cyclic, and has a continuous overlap of p-orbitals around the ring. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.58">This system is stabilised (aromatic) if it contains 4n + 2 electrons, but is destabilised (anti-aromatic) if it contains 4n electrons. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.58">The common feature of bonding in these complexes is that of donation of electrons from ligand - orbitals to the metal and to a lesser extent back-donation from metal d-orbitals into anti-bonding orbitals of the ligand. </s>

<p n="p2.58">
<s n="s1.1;p2.58">Because of its structure Ferrocene reacts in such a way that resembles benzene and because of this it is sometimes referred to as inorganic benzene. </s>

<p n="p4.58">
<s n="s1.1;p4.58">Ferrocene does obey the 18 electron rule as both of the C <hi rend="sub">2</hi>H <hi rend="sub">5</hi> rings donate five electrons and the Iron also has eight valence electrons which it can donate two from its 4s orbital and six from its 3d orbital. </s>
