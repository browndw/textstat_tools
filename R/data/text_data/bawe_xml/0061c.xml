<s n="s1.4;p1.17">When attempting to compare the representation of the press in Heinrich Böll's <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> and Monika Maron's <hi rend="italic"> Flugasche</hi>, one must firstly examine how the press itself is portrayed in the two studies before attempting to draw parallels between them. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.17">It is true to say that both the novel <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> and the novella <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> give the reader a large number of examples of the a very negative depiction of the press. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.17">The pieces differ, however, as the reasons for these pessimistic representations mirror contradicting social themes of the times the books were written. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.17">It is incidentally, somewhat ironic that the very 'ideal' of the press being free is what is, on the one hand the problem in <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> where it is censored by the German Democratic Republic state, but in the case of <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi>, the presence of this freedom within the Federal German Republic destroys Katharina who is left helpless and without state protection. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.3;p2.17">Böll's novella, his first piece of work not to include the war as a main theme and concentrate instead the contemporary issue of the press, is a satirical piece dominated by political motives of the German 'Left' and the 'Springer press', and is used to reflect his opinion of the press; as a universal cancer and portray 'the media as meddlers'.<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.001"/> The paramount theme, therefore, is 'die korrupte und verlogene Boulevard-Presse'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.17">Günter Wirth concurs stating that: 'Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum...[ist]...die subtile Beschreibung eines Rufmordes kapitalistischer Pressemonopolie und seiner Konsequenzen." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.003"/>
<s n="s3.3;p2.17">The piece highlights the ability and willingness of the press to exploit the German Federal Republic population and benefit from people's readiness to see and believe evil in others. </s>

<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.5;p3.17">The press, represented through the newspaper '<hi rend="italic">Die Zeitung</hi>', in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> is described as an immoral institution; '[Böll is] a writer who applies the lens of fiction to matters of morality in its widest sense'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.17">One example of this in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> is the sickening persistence of the reporter Tötges, who is, in himself a personification of the press. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.17">He is desperate to get a story; will hound primary school teachers and his counterparts are shown to travel to disturb a doctor in the mountains merely to ask him about the character of their target; <hi rend="italic">Katharina Blum</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.17">Tötges feels that he must '<hi rend="italic">immer am Ball</hi> [<hi rend="italic">bleiben</hi>]'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.005"/> and the sickening persistence reaches its apogee at the point where '<hi rend="italic">verkleidet Tötges sich daraufhin als Handwerker, kann zu Frau Blum vordringen und sie mit den "Fakten" konfrontieren</hi>'.<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.006"/> It is this interrogation, along with the fabricated version of the truth that Tötges writes in the '<hi rend="italic">Zeitung</hi>' that kills Katharina's mother and is one of the factors which also leads to her eventual destruction by the press through this reporter. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.17">At this point in the narrative another immoral characteristic of the press is also displayed - Tötges mirrors his profession in appearing fake and almost patronising by bringing the sick woman flowers before this harsh questioning of her. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p4.17">The representations of the press in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> are, therefore, different to that in <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> as the press in Maron's novel is not depicted as immoral; it is the state which governs it which is attacked. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.17">One example, however, of morality in <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> is seen in the reaction of Josefa to the town <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.17">and her determination to write the truth about it, instead of an inaccurate version which would survive censorship and be printed. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.17">Early on in the novel Josefa is portrayed as a radical character and one who is uncomfortable with the government's ability to muzzle the press and suppress the truth about the extent of environmental degradation, '<hi rend="italic">Was soll ich</hi> [Josefa] <hi rend="italic">hier, Luise, wenn ich nichts ändern kann.</hi> </s>

<s n="s1.9;p5.17">The complete fabrication in some instances of the testaments of witnesses or character referees in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> is a further negative representation of the press by Böll. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.17">Simple inaccuracies such as the '<hi rend="italic">sensationalle falsche Berichten</hi> [und] <hi rend="italic">bewußte Lügen</hi>'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.009"/> are an immoral depiction of the press. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p5.17">These can be found when Tötges interviews Katharina's mother; her statements to the journalist are distorted in his article. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.17">This representation of the press becomes even more negative when the reporter tries to defend himself: 'daß er als Reporter drauf eingestellt und gewohnt sei, 'einfachen Menschen Artikulationshilfe zu geben''<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.17">An interesting scene in the film Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum is the one at the very end; that of Tötges' funeral. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.17">The image of the camera and the reporter moving along the line of attendants, commentating on the events is a powerful one. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.17">This shows that the press is willing to impose itself on the intimacy of a funeral to get a story. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.17">Another conceivable angle would be that this image reflects the life of Tötges and this invasion of his privacy - of which (like Katharina Blum) he is helpless to prevent.<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.012"/> Either way this is a negative portrayal of the FGR press in Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p11.17">Therefore, Böll describes a very negative picture of the press in the novella by narrating in great detail the unfair, exaggerated and entirely derogatory account the <hi rend="italic">Zeitung</hi> gives of, not only the case, but of Katharina Blum as an individual as well. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p11.17">Her transformation from a nice, well-liked stable member of society to a murderer without remorse runs parallel to her appearances in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitung</hi> and how the imbroglio progresses. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p11.17">One can have no doubt that these atrocities inflicted upon her directly result in her dramatic downfall. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p11.17">As a reader, we become even more disturbed realising that all this said scandal is in fact something that should be, to any reasonable person, merely part of the <hi rend="italic">train train quotidien</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p11.17">Here Böll wishes to make the point that whilst a person may be sharp, intelligent and rational, people as a collective are rash and quick to judge, believe the worst and condemn a new 'evil'. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p11.17">This is a negative depiction of the press as, in this instance; it is a media tool that is geared towards provoking this knee-jerk response. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p12.17">Both central characters, therefore, in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Flugasche</hi> are portrayed as being destroyed emotionally by the press. </s>

</p>
<p n="p13.17">
<s n="s1.2;p13.17">One other independent pessimistic representation of the press in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> is the closeness of the <hi rend="italic">Zeitung</hi> with the authorities. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.17">Unlike the ideal of having these two powerful and beneficial forces aiding each other in the field of crime - as is the intended case in most societies - Böll describes here a relationship of sleaze and corruption, which seeks to bring down and destroy an individual character instead of supporting a member of the population they are supposed to help and protect. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p14.17">The representation of the press as a negative presence in both <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Flugasche</hi> in depicted also in the acceptance and resignation of the population in the two nations that the problem of the press is simply the way it is and nothing can be done about it. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.17">In <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> the vast majority of the GDR population are shown to be passive and accept that the press is a government and not a people tool. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.17">Christian is one such example: '<hi rend="italic">"es gibt gewisse Gepflogenheiten, Normen im menschlichen Zusammenleben, die ein Erwachsener für gewöhnlich kennt.</hi> </s>

<hi rend="italic">Wenn nicht die Polizei, dann die ZEITUNG, und wenn die ZEITUNG die Lust an ihr verliert, dann machen's die Leute."</hi>'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.028"/> Here Böll illustrates that the press controls the lives of the population and almost dictates public opinion. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p15.17">The texts differ in their representation of the media in that; whilst Böll 'offers no realistic solutions'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.029"/> and, according to Durzak, Katharina's protest 'is essentially private and does not significantly impair the yellow press or its questionable practices'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.030"/>, Maron is arguably not entirely pessimistic; '<hi rend="italic">Das Schreiben selbst entzieht sich jedem Reglement</hi>'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.031"/> - here we see a slight indication that, although the press prevents the publication of articles against the state's wishes, it cannot stop the writing or thinking of such ideas and this point offers a slight hope for Josefa. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.17">In <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> Katharina is a self-fulfilling prophesy and her rebellion does not have any gain for her, so writes Sewell: 'While Katharina's individual protest may provide a temporary catharsis, it reduces even further her hard-earned social integrity and is politically futile." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.032"/>
<s n="s3.5;p15.17">This, however, is not the case in <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> as, although Josefa has still been destroyed by the press and the state and so cannot appreciate it, her article, nevertheless, is actually printed and she succeeds, in this way, in what she set out to do. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.17">Another example of a little victory for Josefa is that the <hi rend="italic">zuständige Genosse</hi>' says that he wishes that '<hi rend="italic">es würden alle Journalisten so ehrlich und kämperferisch für die Sache eintreten.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.17">'<ref target="BAWE_0061c-ftnote.033"/> These slightly more positive representations, however, are completely overridden by the many more negative ones which ensure that, on the whole, <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> remains almost an entirely negative portrayal of the press and state in the GDR. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p16.17">The representations of the press in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> reflect the differing social policies of the GDR and the FGR as regards to the media. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p16.17">In <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi>, Josefa hates the state-controlled press and resents the fact that it is censored so the truth can never be known. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p16.17">In <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi>, however, Katharina looks helplessly for protection from the state that will simply never come. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p16.17">It is more than a little ironic that Katharina Blum longs for the very thing which drives Josefa to destruction. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p16.17">In this way Böll and Maron, whilst striving to achieve different things, subconsciously give an analyst of these two pieces bad depictions of the two extreme circumstances the contemporary press can fall to. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p16.17">This suggests that, for the media to be a successful tool of public information, a sensible medium must be found. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p16.17">After studying <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> one would say freedom of the press is important in a modern society but state control should not be so minimal as to allow the destructive sequence of events described by Böll in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.17">
<s n="s1.4;p17.17">In conclusion it is clear that there are many similarities between the representation of the press in Heinrich Böll's <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> and that given by Monika Maron in <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi> in so far as both portrayals are negative. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p17.17">They both narrate a frustrated, yet strong-willed central character who is, in spite of this determination, overcome by the powers of the press and left completely resigned and destroyed. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p17.17">In the case of <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi> Katharina becomes exactly what the press has labelled her, and in this sense is a self-fulfilling prophesy. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p17.17">They differ, however, in that although it is the press entirely put to blame in <hi rend="italic">Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum</hi>, such blame falls not to the press itself specifically but largely to the state who govern it and its power of suppression and fabrication in <hi rend="italic">Flugasche</hi>. </s>
