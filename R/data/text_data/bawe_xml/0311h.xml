<s n="s1.7;p2.77">Optical interference is the effect of the superposition of two coherent light waves. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p2.77">This interference can be constructive, when the amplitudes of the waves add in phase, or destructive, when their amplitudes add out of phase. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p2.77">Interferometers allow the intensity (related to the square of the amplitude) of this light to be observed. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p2.77">This allows us to study properties of the light, as well as exploiting this behaviour to study other things. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p2.77">The most famous example is arguably the use of the Michelson interferometer to refute the existence of the ether (the Michelson-Morley experiment). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p2.77">Interferometry can be put to a variety of uses, notably the accurate measurement of small lengths, and small angles. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p2.77">Other uses include inspection of semiconductor wafers, high resolution spectroscopy and measurement of stellar angular diameter, the cosmic microwave background spectrum, vibrations in buildings and geodetic standard baseline measurements. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.77">
<s n="s1.2;p3.77">There are two main ways in which interferometers operate: firstly, those based on the lateral division of wave fronts using mirrors or diaphragms; secondly, those based on division of amplitude, which divide the waves by partial reflection, giving rise to two wave fronts with the same wavelength, but having reduced amplitude. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.77">The Michelson interferometer is an example of the latter type. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.77">
<s n="s1.2;p4.77">In the course of this investigation, the Michelson interferometer was used firstly to determine the frequencies of the sodium doublet, and the coherence lengths of white light and light from a mercury lamp. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.77">Secondly, the interferometer was used to determine the refractive indices of various gases, by altering the optical path lengths via changing the gas pressure. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p5.77">The Michelson interferometer is an instrument used for studying optical interference. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.77">The interferometer employs partial reflection, using a beamsplitter to divide a wave into two wave fronts of reduced amplitudes. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.77">These two beams are sent in perpendicular directions to be reflected by perpendicular plane mirrors, which then recombine the beams to form interference fringes (see figure 1). </s>

<s n="s2.2;p6.77">A compensating plate is included to render the optical path lengths equal, since the beam travelling to the moveable mirror has to travel through the body of the beam splitter whereas the other beam is reflected from the surface of the beam splitter before recombination.(see figure 2). </s>

<s n="s2.3;p7.77">The slow motion is important because the optical path length only needs to change by the half the light wavelength to move from one interference fringe to the next. </s>

<p n="p8.77">
