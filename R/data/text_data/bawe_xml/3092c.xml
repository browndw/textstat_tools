<s n="s1.2;p1.37">An acute haemorrhage is a sudden loss of blood from a ruptured blood vessel that can occur internally or externally. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.37">The physiological changes that occur are proportionate to the degree and duration of blood lost (O'Neill, 2003). </s>

<p n="p2.37">
<s n="s1.3;p2.37">Blood transports nutrients, oxygen and waste products around the body (Martini, 2004). </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.37">Circulatory blood volume is calculated as approximately 7% of total body weight in kilograms. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.37">It is generally accepted that average adult males and females have 5-6L and 4-5L of blood respectively, the difference being primarily associated with average body size (Martini, 2004). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.37">This gender difference dictates that the same blood loss would leave a smaller female with proportionality less blood volume than a male, and would therefore have greater physiological consequences. </s>

</p>
<p n="p4.37">
<s n="s1.7;p4.37">The body can compensate for minor blood losses without clinical symptoms manifesting, however, a loss of more than 15% of total blood volume causes observable physiological changes (Martini, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.37">These changes include hypovolaemia, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia and haemorrhagic shock. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.37">Such losses require clinical interventions e.g. transfusions to restore blood volume and composition (Collins, 2000). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.37">Vasoconstriction helps elevate blood pressure by decreasing the diameter of the blood vessels thus increasing peripheral resistance. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.37">Tachycardia presents as the heart works harder to compensate for lost volume. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.37">The patient's skin and extremities may become pale, cold and clammy as blood is redirected to vital organs such as the brain and heart (Martini, 2004). </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.37">Water and sodium reabsorption in the kidneys increases thus reducing urinary output and maintaining volume. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.37">
<s n="s1.3;p5.37">Clinically it is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and levels of consciousness. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.37">Any decline in these observations could indicate further haemorrhage or shock. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.37">If untreated, hypovolaemia and its associated physiological changes can quickly cause mortality (Martini, 2004). </s>
