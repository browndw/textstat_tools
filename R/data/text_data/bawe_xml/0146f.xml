<s n="s3.4;p4.88">For fuzzy problems the idea is taken further by having multiple input gates and the input values been in the range -2 to +2 instead of fixed at -1 to represent logic low and +1 to represent logic high. </s>

</p>

<s n="s2.5;p9.88">This is due to the methods available for knowledge input and the way knowledge is extracted from data and interpreted. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.88">This particular example program also has another flaw in that it can give contradictory results given particular input data. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.88">This is because some outputs can be given more than once if certain conditions arise. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.88">To improve this particular expert system it would therefore be necessary to modify the rules to make sure that it can under no circumstances contradict itself. </s>
