<p n="p23.41">

<s n="s1.1;p24.41">They also do not differ from the average for this category in terms of the weekly hours of the TV watched, but tend to listen to the radio 2 hours longer than the average 'heavy buyer' shopping at other supermarkets . </s>

<p n="p25.41">
<s n="s1.2;p25.41">They are car owners and likely to be vegetarian, what positively influences their organic food spending. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p26.41">This category of consumers spends between 6-12 per cent of their monthly expenditure on organic food, and are second largest contributor to Waitrose's income from organic sales (41 per cent), but the same time the most numerous. </s>

<head rend="bold">5. Marketing discussion</head>
<p n="p30.41">
<s n="s1.1;p30.41">The marketing strategy calibrated for Waitrose supermarket chain should be of a hybrid type, taking into account certain common features of organic customers shopping at this chain as well as the characteristics specific for the three distinguished types of spenders. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic is a luxurious purchase</head>

<s n="s1.2;p31.41">The typical Waitrose organic customer is wealthier than the customers shopping at the competitor supermarkets. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.41">The most important feature of organic products that should be therefore emphasised is the luxurious character of purchase, that is not at all common yet. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic is good for your health</head>
<p n="p32.41">
<s n="s1.1;p32.41">The higher average age and wealth of Waitrose customers, could also serve as an indicator for the strategy, that should emphasise the health-beneficial as well as the taste and well-being aspects of organic food consumption. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic is good for your family</head>
<p n="p33.41">
<s n="s1.3;p33.41">Both heavy and medium buyers have larger than average families. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p33.41">The campaign should emphasise the diverse, positive aspects of organic food consumption for people in either age group, especially children and elderly people. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p33.41">Those two groups of top organic spenders seem to already comprise of conscious organic consumers and therefore their positive attitude could be reinforced by emphasising such aspects of the organic food production and consumption as food safety, care for the environment and the animal welfare. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic for singles</head>
<p n="p34.41">
<s n="s1.3;p34.41">The group of light buyers is relatively small yet and therefore has potential for growth. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p34.41">As they life in small households with no children, their general food purchases will be limited in bulk, but can be of a high quality, given their average income. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p34.41">Therefore it is suggested, that the organic products in the campaign targeted at this group should be presented not only as a health beneficial, but also high quality, tasty and perfectly fitting their modern lifestyle. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic-yes but not own brand</head>
<p n="p35.41">
<s n="s1.2;p35.41">As organic shoppers across all categories did show relatively lower interest in own-branded products, therefore it is important to inform customers that specifically at Waitrose they can purchase organic products from the renowned producers. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.41">The product should have its own unique identity and be linked with the area of origin. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic meat-yes, but only for heavy buyers</head>
<p n="p36.41">
<s n="s1.3;p36.41">It is worth noting, that only heavy buyers spend more on each of the analysed products categories, namely meat, fish and vegetables. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p36.41">The remaining two tend to reduce their overall meat consumption in favour of fish and vegetables, what is especially evident in the 'light buyer's' spending patterns. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p36.41">This is particularly important as far as the visual aspects of the future marketing campaigns are concerned, as it indicates which products should be displayed in TV commercials or in promotional folders. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Organic and the media</head>
<p n="p37.41">
<s n="s1.4;p37.41">Members of all of the distinguished groups use the media such as TV or radio more or at least as frequently as the average organic consumers. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p37.41">The heavy buyers tend to favour radio over TV and this fact could serve as an indicator for organic radio campaign. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p37.41">It is highly likely that the radio programmes informing about various aspects of organic food consumption would be well received by them. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p37.41">Therefore it is worth considering a sponsorship of such programs and building up positive relationships with the TV and radio reporters. </s>

<head rend="bold">Surfi'n'orgnic</head>
<p n="p38.41">
<s n="s1.2;p38.41">The light buyers could easily be reached by the Internet, as they form the most often web-surfing group. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p38.41">Hence the web site should be informative of attractive and interactive design, if this group is to be encouraged to increase their purchases. </s>

<p n="p39.41">
<s n="s1.2;p39.41">As an additional and final point it should be added, that for the whole investigated sample, the factors most strongly and positively correlated with the spending on organic foods were household size, annual income and customer's age. </s>

<p n="p40.41">
<s n="s1.5;p40.41">Although this report does not offer a simple, quick-fix marketing formula for sales and revenue increase, the ACC research shows that the attention has to be paid to a wide range of factors if the successful marketing strategy is to be implemented. </s>
