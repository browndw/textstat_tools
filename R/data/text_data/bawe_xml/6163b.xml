<s n="s4.4;p4.15">This, combined with the baroclinic instability at the surface at that point (i.e. the kink in the trailing cold front), suggests that the low is going to develop. </s>

<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.3;p5.15">In the vicinity of the southern entrance to a jet stream, there is upper level divergence and lower level convergence. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.15">This results in a rising air mass, which encourages cyclone development. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.15">However, the jet stream would need to be further north for this to be an important factor at 0000UTC (the method may have become more important later in the cyclone's development however). </s>

<s n="s4.5;p6.15">This result is expected as the wind is calculated at the 500hPa level, so it's well above the boundary layer. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p6.15">Therefore there would be no friction which could cause ageostrophic winds. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.15">However, an ageostrophic wind component is normally found in the vicinity of a jet exit region. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.15">This is because air parcels decelerate in jet exit regions, so they aren't in geostrophic balance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.15">This leads to ageostrophic motion in jet exit regions towards the area of higher pressure. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.15">The reason this isn't observed in the calculated/measured wind may be because the station is situated too far from the exit of the jet to be noticeable (or I've drawn my contours wrongly!) </s>

<s n="s1.1;p10.15">The system has been accelerated along the jet stream and has moved towards the North East (so that the surface low is now positioned ~ 55 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>N, 5 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>E at 12:00UTC). </s>

<s n="s1.3;p11.15">The jet stream is now positioned directly behind the cold front. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.15">This is expected as air is being pulled down from the top of the troposphere at this point and has more momentum, therefore faster winds would be expected (jet streaks). </s>

<s n="s6.8;p14.15">The cyclone is also now situated near the northern exit of the jet stream; therefore it may be developing through the process discussed in question A2. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p14.15">It's more likely however that this process happened slightly earlier in the cyclone development (i.e. about 06:00UTC when the explosive low developed). </s>
