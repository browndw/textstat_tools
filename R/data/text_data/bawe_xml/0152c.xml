<s n="s1.6;p1.11">"At its core, the goal of a company is to create value," said Jean-Paul Page in his article <hi rend="italic">'Corporate Governance and Value Creation'</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.11">Hence enter the role of Corporate Governance which is basically how a company is controlled and directed. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.11">Traditionally most firms adopt the shareholder approach which emphasises on maximising shareholder wealth. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.11">However for the past few years, there is a growing interest on the stakeholder model. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.11">Under this model, management is supposed to focus on long-term survival, which is achieved by satisfying the interests of stakeholders.<ref target="BAWE_0152c-ftnote.001"/> Stakeholders' interests are evaluated according to the firm's overall purpose and mission and then translated into the firm's business strategy or principles. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.11">Thus, in my opinion, this theory encourages a more straight-forward approach towards addressing social responsibility compared to the shareholder approach. </s>

<p n="p2.11">
<s n="s1.1;p2.11">The definition of corporate social responsibility (CSR) varies among companies but generally CSR is often seen as the business's efforts towards sustainable development and is represented through the way a company balances its economic, environmental and social objectives while addressing stakeholder expectations and enhancing shareholder value.<ref target="BAWE_0152c-ftnote.002"/> Here, Nestle is taken as an example although I will focus only on its <hi rend="italic">social</hi> objectives. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p3.11">Nestle has a 12-person shareholder-appointed Board of Directors, all of which are non-executive members, except for the Chairman who is also the CEO. Nestle incorporates their business strategy in the <hi rend="italic">Nestle Corporate Business Principles</hi> (NCBP). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.11">These principles, in general, state that Nestle is concerned with developing products that would ensure sustainable value for shareholders, employees, and consumers over the long term. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.11">These principles are supposed to guide the company, its employees and activities no matter where the business is located. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p3.11">Consequently, the Board's responsibility is to implement all the values laid out in the NCBP. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.1;p4.11">However, the CEO recently claimed that there should not be an obligation to 'give back' to communities because they have not taken anything away from the society.<ref target="BAWE_0152c-ftnote.003"/> This, in my opinion, contrasts with what is said in the NCBP because there, Nestle clearly acknowledges the fact that it would not exist without its consumers. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.11">Nestle, in the NCBP; say that they do not favour short-term profits at the expense of long-term business development. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.11">But why, then, were they internationally boycotted for their unethical marketing of breast milk substitutes in developing nations in the late 70s? </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.11">(This boycott continues until now in a number of countries).<ref target="BAWE_0152c-ftnote.004"/> This shows that they actually were favouring short-term profits. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.11">I would assume that 'consumers' welfare' can be agreed as a business development as they would provide as a good performance indicator for a particular company. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.11">By flouting the WHA International Code Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, Nestle used strategies of deceptions to market its baby milk products to maintain their estimated $4 billion market share in the baby-milk industry.<ref target="BAWE_0152c-ftnote.005"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p6.11">From demanding compensation worth millions from a poor country such as Ethiopia to their cocoa and coffee-buying practices (which are argued to be exploiting farmers by OXFAM), from the issue of trade union busting in Colombia to the use of genetically-modified ingredients, I think Nestle has done quite a damage to its corporate image, not to mention its employee morale. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.11">However they are actually a good corporate citizen in many respects. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.11">An example is their support for nationwide HIV/AIDS prevention programmes for teenagers in Nigeria and Kenya which is reported in their 2004 CSR Report. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.11">
<s n="s1.5;p7.11">All in all, I feel that while Nestle addresses well the drive towards sustainability, it sometimes overlook or disregard ethical corporate philanthropy which many believe can also enhance shareholder value. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.11">Nestle does to an extent consider the interests of its stakeholders although adopting shareholder-focused governance. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.11">I believe that CSR is better grasp by the stakeholder model as it considers that a firm can make long-term developments and maximise value <hi rend="italic">while</hi> taking into account the interest of stakeholders. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.11">However as the business is actually owned by the shareholders I think that it is only fair that they be given some advantage over the other stakeholders. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.11">With respect to corporate governance as a business ethics issue, I believe that it is a vital subject as failure to incorporate good governance will indicate a threat to the future of any corporation. </s>
