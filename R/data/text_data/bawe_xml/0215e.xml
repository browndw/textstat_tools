<p n="p1.9">
<s n="s1.8;p1.9">In order to appreciate whether or not 'I exist' is a well formed claim, it is first necessary to examine the reasons why some have considered it not to be. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.9">To begin at the beginning, predicates, as a general rule, describe a given subject. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.9">They provide us with information about a subject: 'Sweeney Todd is a man', 'Sweeney Todd is a barber', and 'Sweeney Todd likes murdering his clients'. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.9">The predicates in the above sentences are those words which follow the proper noun 'Sweeney Todd'. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.9">Already we can see a pattern emerging; each of the above sentences is identical in terms of their logical grammar. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.9">As a result, they can all be expressed as 'x is F', where x is the subject and F the predicate. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.9">By using logical grammar instead of the muddled English language, the structure of the sentence is exposed, revealing the meaning rather than masking it behind the ambiguity of language. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.9">It also enables us to compare sentences with greater ease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.9">
<s n="s1.10;p2.9">To say that 'exists' is a first level predicate is to say that it works in precisely the same manner as predicates such as 'is a man' and 'is a barber': namely that it attributes something to the subject being described - the quality of existence. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.9">In Descartes' 'Meditations', he argues that God's existence is inseparable from His essence, meaning that God, along with all His attributes, must necessarily exist. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.9">Here Descartes is using 'exists' as though it were a first order predicate. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.9">This is clearly erroneous, however, since adding 'exists' to the end of a long list of attributes does not describe the subject in any more detail. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.9">When, for example, describing the perfect man, tacking on 'and he exists' to the end of the description provides no more information about his appearance or personality. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.9">Further evidence of the fallaciousness of thinking that 'exists' is a first level predicate is the peculiarity of negative existential statements. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.9">If 'exists' is indeed a first order predicate, then to deny the statement 'God exists' ('x is F' for ease of expression) is equivalent to saying 'there is an x, x is not'. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.9">The subject is asserted before it is denied: how can it be possible for something to both exist and not exist at the same time? </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.9">Quite obviously 'exists' cannot function in the same manner as 'is a man', rather it describes predicates themselves - the Predicate of Predicates, if you like. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.9">When we say 'x exists' we mean that x, along with all its attributes, is present in our universe. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.9">
<s n="s1.5;p3.9">It would, therefore, appear that 'exists' is a second level predicate rather than one of the first order. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.9">If we exchange 'exists' for 'there is', we find that a sentence such as 'there are barbers' is equivalent to saying 'there is an x, x is F'. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.9">When we phrase this in the negative, we get 'there are no butchers', or 'it is not the case that there is an x, x is F'. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.9">In other words, the fictional character of Sweeney Todd, demon barber of Fleet Street, can 'be a man' and 'be a barber' without actually existing. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.9">There is no contradiction here, unlike that which emerges when one tries to negate first order existential claims because we are denying the existence of a subject along with all its predicates. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.9">
<s n="s1.7;p4.9">Mackie, in 'The Miracle of Theism', claims that Descartes has confused first and second level predicates in his ontological argument. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.9">Mackie asserts that we can agree with the claim 'the existing God does not exist is self-contradictory' while at the same time denying the claim that 'Ex, x is God'. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.9">The first statement, which takes 'exists' to be a first level predicate, is a matter of definition, and as a result everyone ought to agree upon it. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.9">It does not, however, necessarily entail the second statement: 'Ex, x is God.' </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.9">It is quite possible with second level predicates, as has been shown, to deny the subject and the predicate alike. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.9">To borrow an example from Kant, it is logically consistent to acknowledge that triangles have three sides while at the same time denying that such a thing has the property of existence. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.9">Therefore, Mackie argues that Descartes' form of the ontological argument fails. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.9">
<s n="s1.9;p5.9">Nevertheless, if we examine the notion of second level predicates in more detail we begin to see that there may be a difficulty with this wonderfully neat solution. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p5.9">The problem with 'exists' being a second level predicate is that, by virtue of its formation, it can only be used to make general claims. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.9">A sentence which uses 'exists' as a second order predicate appears in the form 'Ex, x is F' in logical grammar. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p5.9">What it does is to change the subject into a predicate, for example 'x exists, that x is Fred', where 'is Fred' is the predicate. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p5.9">Therefore the claim about God's existence becomes 'there is an x, x is God', but does transforming 'God' into a general predicate solve the problem? </s>
<s n="s6.9;p5.9">It would surely seem that the word 'God', certainly in the manner Descartes understands it, if not the majority of Western culture, is a singular expression, not a general one. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p5.9">It refers to a specific entity, much like the words 'this' and 'I'. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p5.9">If 'exists' is a second order predicate then there can be no singular existential claims. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p5.9">Descartes, however, thought that singular existential claims were possible: his entire cogito depends on the validity of the pronoun 'I'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.9">
<s n="s1.8;p6.9">If we assume for the moment that the statement 'I exist' can be generalised, we end up with a sentence like: 'Ex, x is me'. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p6.9">The inclusion of 'me' in this sentence means that this statement still retains the sense of singularity: 'me' applies to me and no one else. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p6.9">In order to remove this singularity, we might produce a sentence such as 'Ex, x is sitting at a computer in Rootes next to a pot plant.' </s>
<s n="s4.8;p6.9">The problem with this sentence is that it removes any sense of agency. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p6.9">If I am informed that <hi rend="underlined">I</hi> am about to be killed by a crossbow bolt, I shall move with all necessary speed. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p6.9">If I understand that 'Ex, x is sitting at a computer in Rootes next to a pot plant, x will shortly be killed by a crossbow bolt,' there is no real sense in which I understand that I am about to die. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p6.9">To attempt to generalise the statement 'I exist' is to lose the sense of agency attached to the pronoun 'I'. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p6.9">This would then suggest that 'I exist' must be a well formed claim, despite the fact that it cannot be made into a generalised expression. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.9">
<s n="s1.5;p7.9">Where, then, does this leave debates about the truth of the ontological argument? </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.9">If 'I exist' is in fact a well formed claim, then we must allow for the potential truth of the claim 'God exists'. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.9">'I exist' is a genuinely referring expression, and, as such, cannot be turned into a predicate without losing that crucial sense of agency. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.9">If 'God' is a genuinely referring expression, then the simplistic view would be that Descartes' ontological argument is completely true. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.9">But is it? </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.9">
<s n="s1.9;p8.9">It is, of course, debateable whether 'God' really is a genuinely referring expression. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p8.9">With a word like 'this', the object referred to can be directly pointed at. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p8.9">When we say 'this brick', we are singling out that particular brick out from all the other trillions of bricks in the world. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p8.9">It is hard to see how this requisite ability to point at the thing you are describing applies to God. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p8.9">Descartes would perhaps argue that the very act of thinking about God involves a 'pointing' of sorts: each time we think of God we are effectively singling Him out. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p8.9">If the term 'God' is indeed a genuinely referring expression, it must refer to itself in the same manner as 'I' and 'this'. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p8.9">The problem with this is that it appears to beg the question; it assumes that its central tenet has already been proven. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p8.9">Rather than provide a step-by-step proof of God's existence, we are simply told that He exists and that His existence can no more be separated from His essence than a mountain can be from a valley. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p8.9">We appear to have returned to Descartes' original assertion in Meditation V. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.9">
<s n="s1.6;p9.9">The difficulty raised by these genuinely referring expressions is that they are entirely unpackable. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p9.9">They are their own reference points and as such cannot be described in terms of anything else. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p9.9">This seems like a fairly accurate description of an omniscient, omnipotent God, but it is essentially unhelpful in providing a proof for His existence. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p9.9">The question that remains, then, is this: is the circularity of the ontological argument incredibly clever, in that every possible avenue of exploration terminates in a necessarily existing God? </s>
<s n="s5.6;p9.9">Or is this simply a superb example of begging the question? </s>
<s n="s6.6;p9.9">It appears simply too close to call. </s>
