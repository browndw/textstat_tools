<s n="s1.4;p6.26">Order, in Bull's construct, is 'in the common interests of all states in achieving the elementary goals of social life - the security of life against violence, the sanctity of promises, and the stability of possessions'.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.022"/> International society provided for these with the acceptance of rules and laws governing behaviour. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.26">Thus, one of the essential institutions of order in Bull's theory is international law.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.023"/> Law provided the rationalisation of the principles by which states limited their actions. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.26">It helped provide order by 'identifying the constitutive principle of the society of states, setting the basic rules for coexistence, and providing a language for their formal relations'.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.024"/> The expansion of these principles, codified as law, was essential to the homogeneity of international society as constituted by heterogeneous units. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.26">This was possible in the <hi rend="italic">Gesellschaft</hi> understanding of social identity, in which states would relate to the common principles governing practical association, in this context, international society, and adjust their behaviour accordingly.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.025"/> With this, Bull believed that a common culture of international society could develop and that consensus required for stable interstate relations could and should be realised, but that it would be difficult.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.026"/> This 'progressivism' was mitigated by other factors prevalent in the system of states, namely war, the balance of power and the management of the great powers, which often undermined notions of international law and consensus, in order to provide the fundamental requirements of order.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.027"/> 'Bull drew heavily on the realist tradition' in this respect and interests of power were judged to be incommensurable with societal consensus when a readjustment of the international order was required.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.028"/> Therefore, Bull held a 'rationalist position qualified by realist considerations'.<ref target="BAWE_0255e-ftnote.029"/> </s>
