<s n="s1.4;p1.12">Comparing holistic healing systems to scientific medicine is extremely problematic. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.12">They do not share the same starting points or very little common ground and it is especially problematic to define the 'holistic' approach embedded in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:587). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.12">However, the increase in the use of CAM over the past 10 years cannot be ignored (Giddins 2001:142, Zollman 2006:836) and the reasons for this increase are far from clear (Cant and Calnan 1991:40, Zollman 2006:836). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.12">To consider, therefore, the extent to which CAM can be an alternative or complementary medicine source to scientific medicine is far from easy. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.12">
<s n="s1.5;p2.12">In this essay I will briefly describe both 'scientific' and 'alternative' and 'complementary' medicines.<hi rend="sup">(1)</hi> My arguments will focus on three areas. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.12">Firstly, CAM operates on a much less hierarchical method than the biomedical model and can therefore provide a contrasting alternative structure for the provision of health care, although this may be impossible to accommodate it within the NHS structure (Sharma 1992:3). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.12">Secondly, CAM encourages patient participation (Sharma 1995:41), as opposed to the biomedical model where the patient is the passive recipient (Aakster 1986:268) and can therefore offer a considerably different consultation system. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.12">However, this may only be possible for certain individuals, those who are articulate and knowledgeable and those with lesser knowledge or articulation skills/abilities will be excluded. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.12">Thirdly, there is much evidence supporting the use of CAM as a complementary form of medicine in conjunction with scientific medicines, for example health promotion/disease prevention </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.1;p3.12">These will be very crude descriptions of complex practices as there is insufficient space in this essay to give substantial detail. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.1;p4.12">(Blaxter 2004:139, DoH 2003) that support government initiatives such as the '5 a day' campaign (DoH 2003) or improving mental health and wellbeing (DoH 2004b) or managing chronic illness in hospices (Kohn 1999:2). </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Explaining the Biomedical model</head>
<p n="p5.12">
<s n="s1.3;p5.12">The modern biomedical model is 'defined by the absence of disease' (Blaxter 2004:19) and diagnosis is made mainly on physical aspects - something is wrong with a particular part of the body and it is up to the physician to identify the illness and treat the sysmptom either by the use of drugs or surgery (Giddins 2001:155, Coward 1989:7). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.12">Biomedical knowledge is scientifically proven and treatment is therefore based on that knowledge (Giddens 2001:143). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.12">The dissection of knowledge into 'specialisms' creates powerful experts (Giddins 2001:156) and whilst this can ensure a great depth of knowledge about a particular illness or disease, it may result in patients having to see different specialists in order to identify their particular illness. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Explaining CAM </head>
<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.6;p6.12">In the case of CAM, it must be noted that this label includes a vast range of diverse medicines, including homoeopathy, chiropody, osteopathy, spiritual healing, herbalism and acupuncture (Saks 1995:104, Cant and Calnan 1991:54, Mason et al 2006:832), but they do share the common practice of providing 'holistic' treatment (Zollman 2006:693). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.12">However, defining holistic is extremely difficult (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:587, Sharma 1992:108). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.12">One of the key aspects of the holistic approach is the addressing of imbalances in the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> body, in other words, mind, body and spirit, to create good health (Coward 1989:71, Zollman 1999:695) or even extend holism to include environments external to the body (Mason et al 2006:832, Blaxter 1990:233). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.12">However, patients often use a use a variety of alternative or complementary medicines to address different illnesses (Sharma 1992:109), thereby emulating the 'specialisms' of the biomedical model. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.12">Another key aspect is the way in which practitioners work with the patient so that the individual takes responsibility for their own heath (Coward 1989:71). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.12">The problem with this is that they can adversely be responsible for their illness (Coward 1989:64/71) </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">The increase in CAM</head>
<p n="p7.12">
<s n="s1.4;p7.12">It is generally agreed that there has been a significant increase in the use of CAM over the past 10 years (Giddins 2001:142). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.12">In 1993 it was estimated that 33% of the UK population had used some form of CAM (Zollman 2006:836), today it is estimated that one in four people use them (Giddins 2001:142). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.12">The increased used has also meant a growth in the number of CAM practitioners - numbers are estimated to be growing 5-6 times faster than medical doctors (Cant and Calnan 1991:40). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.12">Furthermore, according to a survey conducted by Sharma (1992:210) 74% of people surveyed said they would like CAM included in the NHS and this would further increase the availability and use of CAM. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">CAM's linear structure as an alternative</head>
<p n="p8.12">
<s n="s1.12;p8.12">Coward (1989:10) argues that the structural changes required to accommodate CAM into the NHS are unthinkable. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p8.12">With its segmented and regimented structure of highly paid experts and nurses whose day to day responsibilities for patient care remains unvalued. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p8.12">Whilst Saks (1995:258) does not believe that the medical professionals would ever give up their exclusivity and allow CAM practitioners to dilute their power. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p8.12">It is interesting to note however, that although the medical profession is responsible for making decisions in respect of medicines used, to the exclusion of CAM, public pressure can 'force their hand' (Saks 1995:229). </s>
<s n="s5.12;p8.12">For example in the case of acupuncture that was rejected by the medical profession during the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century has now become more acceptable in the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century because of increased public demand. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p8.12">Other arguments range from a call for the dissolution of the medical profession, (Illich 1973:34 cited in Saks 1995:261) to break up the monopoly which is seen as counter productive to industrial development, to those such as Stacey (1992 cited in Saks 1975:262) who believes that a powerful medical profession separate from government ensures public interest are protected, for example nuclear waste. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p8.12">CAM practitioners have a less 'God likeness' (Lowenberg and Davis (1989:590), but the drawback of this is that CAM fails to compete equitably for research funding. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p8.12">The medical profession are not the only ones who would argue against a change in NHS structure. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p8.12">Under the pharmaceutical model (Griffin 1975 cited in Aakster 1986:269) there is little mileage in supporting a system that does not follow conventional medicine. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p8.12">In that disease is associated with defect and can be fixed by drugs from which vast amounts of money are made. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p8.12">Therefore, although CAM can offer an alternative to the medical profession's hierarchical structure, there is little chance of incorporating a more linear method as there is far too much power to be lost by those with it (Cant and Calnan 1991:55) and access to CAM will continue to be on a 'postcode lottery' basis - only available in areas where medical practices buy into it (Kohn 1999:40). </s>
<s n="s12.12;p8.12">Furthermore, the diverse range of therapies under the CAM umbrella would add further complications to creating an alternative linear structure within the health care system (Welsh et al 2004:236). </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">CAM as alternative in terms of patient involvement</head>
<p n="p9.12">
<s n="s1.13;p9.12">The holistic approach reduces the distance between patient and practitioners (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:587, Scott 1998:209), making the return to health a joint aim, rather then just resorting to the physician's expertise as in the biomedical model. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p9.12">However, the question arises as to whether this also results in 'deprofessionalisation' (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:589). </s>
<s n="s3.13;p9.12">With the more recent focus of individual responsibility (agency) for health people are no longer happy to be treated just as bodies and the CAM approach enables them more involvement in their treatment (Coward 1989:7). </s>
<s n="s4.13;p9.12">This presents a challenge to Parson's 'sick role' (Sharma 1992:27) in that sick people are no longer relieved from they social responsibilities. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p9.12">It is the increased responsibility that has been the predominant reason for the rise in the use of CAM, not the dissatisfaction with biomedical professionals. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p9.12">For example, 57% of people surveyed said 'they wanted to use all possible options in healthcare'. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p9.12">Interestingly though, the second most popular reason for choosing CAM was 'they hoped to be cured without side-effects' (Furnham and Vincent 2000:69, Cant and Calnan 1991:45). </s>
<s n="s8.13;p9.12">This aspect of more patient power is particularly attractive to women (Sharma 1992:20) who argue that natural processes have been medicalized by the (male dominated) biomedical model for example pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause (Oakley 1984 cited in Giddens 2001:156, Freund and McGuire 1999:195, Lowenberg and Davis 1989:580). </s>
<s n="s9.13;p9.12">In the case of the menopause there is much support for alternative methods to hormone replacement therapy for reducing symptoms (Patient UK 2005, WNAS 2002), such as herbal or homoeopathic remedies. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p9.12">However, the CAM concept of extending causes of illness to external factors (Mason et al 2006:832, Blaxter 1990:233) could be argued to be extending medicalization to the whole of life (Armstrong 1995:46) (bio-psycho-social model). </s>
<s n="s11.13;p9.12">With more equality between patient and practitioner in CAM treatments, women can feel they are regaining more control over their bodies. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p9.12">Sharma (1992:20) and Zollman (2006:837) both provide evidence that this it is not only predominantly women who are the main users of CAM, but that it is only women who are more highly educated, with higher incomes and senior/middle management professionals. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p9.12">As a result there is little challenge to the inverse care law whereby those in most need, the poor, the elderly, have the least access to health care (Giddins 2001:153). </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">CAM as complimentary to scientific medicine</head>
<p n="p10.12">
<s n="s1.15;p10.12">The move towards prevention rather than cure has been informed by two major considerations. </s>
<s n="s2.15;p10.12">Firstly the scepticism toward modern medicine to cure all ills (Goldstein 2000:31, Sharma 1995:39) and the spiralling costs of proving NHS health care (Goldstein 2000:32). </s>
<s n="s3.15;p10.12">Whilst the biomedical model can be praised for reducing infectious diseases and extending life for both young and old (Blaxter 2004:99), it has in some respects been a victim of its own success. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p10.12">More complex and degenerative diseases have replaced previous ones, resulting in the need for more research and more complex and expensive drugs and surgery, for example, hip replacements and chemotherapy. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p10.12">The emphasis on prevention is supported by the government in its Choosing Health White paper (DoH 2004b) as well as being supported by biomedical professionals, CAM practitioners, and the fitness industry, who have shared values with CAM (Goldstein 2000:28). </s>
<s n="s6.15;p10.12">CAM philosophy around illness is based on how individuals deal with the effects of increasing levels of stress presented by the modern world (Coward 1989:82) and this supports the idea that individuals can cure themselves, or play an active part in preventing disease. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p10.12">In such a way, individuals can make 'informed choices' (DoH 2004:5) and take steps towards changing their lifestyles to improve overall health and actively reduce influences known to cause disease. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p10.12">For instance, taking stress as an example, increasing physical activity and reducing the intake of certain foods or drink can alleviate compounded stress (DoH 2004c:60). </s>
<s n="s9.15;p10.12">Once responsibility is taken for individual health the step towards sampling CAM is made easier by the wealth of information generated by the CAM industry, in the form of internet web sites, self-help books and shops (Giddins 2001:143), the increasing incidence of recommendation from friends and family who have tried one or other of the therapies (Sharma 1992:69) and the availability of CAM 'over the counter' (Cant and Sharma 1996:583). </s>
<s n="s10.15;p10.12">The negative aspect of this is that lay people cannot possibly acquire levels of knowledge equal to those of medical professionals and this may have adverse affects in terms of actually being able to prevent or cure disease or leads to the belief that they alone are responsible for the occurrence of their illness (Coward 1989:64/71). </s>
<s n="s11.15;p10.12">There is also evidence of chronically or terminally ill patients using CAM to compliment treatments and drugs prescribed by biomedical professionals, to find relief either from pain or reduce side effects of those prescribed drugs/treatments (Kohn 1999:2). </s>
<s n="s12.15;p10.12">For example, up to 80% of cancer patients have been recorded as using CAM to manage their illness (Datamonitor 2002:1) and in particular there is high usage of CAM at the Bristol Cancer Care Centre (Kohn 1999:2). </s>
<s n="s13.15;p10.12">Kohn reports that acupuncture to relieve nausea and imagery to improve quality of life are often the highest used CAM amongst cancer patients (Kohn 1999 exec summary). </s>
<s n="s14.15;p10.12">Patient power is also evident in that 97% of Macmillan nurses were asked for information about complementary therapies by their patients (Kohn 1999). </s>
<s n="s15.15;p10.12">There is evidence, therefore, that to quite a considerable extent CAM can be complementary to scientific medicines for some groups of people, for example women and those with chronic disease. </s>

<head rend="bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p11.12">
<s n="s1.10;p11.12">There can be little doubt about the gaining popularity of CAM in the UK (Giddins 2001:142, Zollman 2006:836, Cant and Calnan 1991:40, Sharma 1992:210), but it is also evident that generalising about CAM and its practitioners is problematic as is understanding the concept of 'holism' embedded in CAM philosophy (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:587, Sharma 1992:108). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p11.12">In this essay I have argued that CAM offers a direct alternative, more linear structure to medical care, but that it may not be possible to accommodate such as structure within the hierarchical medical professionalism of the NHS (Sharma 1992:3, Coward 1989:10). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p11.12">This is especially unlikely as CAM attracts little research funding and will have a hard time competing with powerful pharmaceutical companies. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p11.12">My second argument supported the considerably different consultation procedure used by CAM practitioners, which reduces the distance between the patient and themselves (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:587, Scott 1998:209). </s>
<s n="s5.10;p11.12">To a great extent this method challenges biomedical model that puts the patient in the passive role (Aakster 1986:268) and supports the move toward patient empowerment (Coward 1989:7, DoH 2004:5). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p11.12">However, it raises concern that only those able to act in such a way, the more educated and higher paid (Sharma 1992:20, Zollman 2006:837), are more likely to access CAM, but it will be beyond the reach of those in most need, the poor and the elderly (Giddins 2001:153). </s>
<s n="s7.10;p11.12">My final argument is that CAM can be used extensively to promote health/prevent disease. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p11.12">Strengthening the body to combat disease is the focus of CAM's holistic practices and this can not only be used to improve/maintain good health, but also relieve symptoms in chronic illness. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p11.12">Complementary to support natural processes, such as child birth and menopause, which have been medicalized by the scientific biomedical medicine (Oakley 1984 cited in Giddens 2001:156, Freund and McGuire 1999:195, Lowenberg and Davis 1989:580), can be dealt with by the individual, using CAM (Patient UK 2005, WNAS 2002), without incurring unpleasant side-effects. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p11.12">Furthermore, those coping with chronic disease can be offered complementary alternatives to help improve quality of life and aiding pain relief (Kohn 1999:2). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.12">
<s n="s1.1;p12.12">Therefore, there are areas where CAM can, to a greater or lesser extent, be alternative or complementary to scientific medicine, but these are dependant upon complex practice and policy considerations. </s>
