<s n="s1.7;p1.17">Since John Fairbank's publication of <hi rend="italic">The Chinese World Order: Traditional China's Foreign Relations</hi> in 1968, Fairbank has been widely considered a leading scholar on Chinese history. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p2.17">The traditional perception of the Chinese tribute system, which Fairbank espoused, is of an administrative practice that survived from its inception in early Han China (206 BC to 220 AD) until the Opium Wars (1834-43 and 1856-60) to control vassals and demand tribute from foreign regions.<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.003"/> An integral part of Confucian philosophy, the tribute system was considered a court ritual which placed subordinate states within an all-embracing Sino-centric cosmos.<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.004"/> The tribute itself held little gain to the imperial court<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.005"/> except as a diplomatic medium but since the emperor displayed such apparent 'benevolence,'<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.006"/> foreigners were permitted to engage in carefully controlled trade for a limited number of days. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.008"/>
<s n="s2.4;p3.17">According to Wills, 'Between 1514-1662, the people and government of China were involved in, and affected by, the first stages of the development of a "modern world system"'<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.009"/> that had significant consequences for their relations with foreigners. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.17">Following deeper study into the Qing dynasty, scholars have clearly identified how Qing rulers functioned in 'highly political, personal, ceremonious ways that owed little to the tribute system background in negotiating their own sway over an Inner Asian "multitude of lords."'<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.010"/> From this new school of thought has emerged one of Fairbank's fiercest critics, James L. Hevia who as a post-modern historian has a fresh approach about the tribute system. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p5.17">T.F. Tsaing, another advocate for the tribute system theory of foreign relations writing prior to Fairbank in 1936, estimated that China's main objective was defending its borders.<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.012"/> Within the common perception of the tribute system, was that in return for submitting to China's 'cultural superiority,' vassal states could depend on Chinese defence.<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.013"/> According to recent research however, the system provided a security measure for the Chinese who were feeling increasingly vulnerable. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.17">As surrounding countries grew in strength and in particular when Japanese pirates threatened coastal areas, the Ming saw the tribute system as an effective means of limiting foreign contact.<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.014"/> The Chinese court was also keen to defend the empire from cultural and political subversion by missionaries,<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.015"/> and in another sense, defend the appearances of the ceremonial supremacy of the Son of Heaven.<ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.016"/> According to Wang Gung-wu, the system also allowed China to retain its myth of superiority and image as protector of the weak against the strong, when China itself did not want to resort to force. <ref target="BAWE_0391e-endnote.017"/> </s>
