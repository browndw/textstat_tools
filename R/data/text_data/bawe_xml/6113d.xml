<head rend="bold italic">1. Introduction</head>
<p n="p1.20">
<s n="s1.5;p1.20">The use of water for nursery irrigation is predicted to be a crucial issue for ornamental industry over the next decade. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.20">Increased water cost and decreased availability are almost certain to occur. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.20">Some European countries, mostly from the Mediterranean zone, have experienced significant water shortages and in many cases demand for water exceeds supply. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.20">As a result, ornamental producers must learn to manage effectively this invaluable natural source. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.20">Undoubtedly, the implementation of effective irrigation management techniques is the most essential step for the accomplishment of irrigation water use efficiency. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">2. Water conserving practices </head>
<p n="p2.20">
<s n="s1.2;p2.20">According to Garber <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.20">, (2002: 730), the most important practices to conserve water used in container nurseries are: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English" rend="italic">"water recycling, irrigating when needed and for the minimum required time, use of drip or sub-irrigation instead of overhead irrigation, watering in the morning hours to minimize loss of water due to evaporation, watering based on plant requirement and not based on preset frequency, use of cyclic irrigation, arrangement of containers (such as grouping by size), altering growing media (including wetting agents), use of cyclic irrigation and timely repair irrigation system leaks." </quote>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold italic">3. Runoff collection</head>
<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.6;p3.20">Runoff collection and reuse is one of the major principles of efficient water management use. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.20">Reuse of captured runoff water may ideally reduce fresh water consumption during production of nursery crops. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.20">As Beeson <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.20">(2004), point out, modern laws and regulations in U.S.A. require reduction of fresh underground water or public surface waters used by nurseries. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.20">Stricter regulations are also currently limit nutrient concentration in water leaving nurseries (nursery runoff). </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.20">The construction of runoff collection and storage basins is strongly recommended to deal with the requirements of these regulations because the reuse of irrigation waters reduces the volume of fresh water used for irrigation and limits the release of nutrients and pesticides to the environment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.11;p4.20">On the other hand, recycling of runoff concentrates soluble salts, increasing salinity to levels that irrigation water is unacceptable for ornamental production. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p4.20">Constructed wetlands (gravel or bog wetlands for the filtration of nursery runoff water) may provide a simple, low technology method for reducing nutrient concentrations and improving runoff water quality. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p4.20">A study by Arnold <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.11;p4.20">(2004: 217) indicates that "a single pass of nursery runoff through constructed wetlands substantially reduced nitrogen concentrations without increasing salinity. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p4.20">Nevertheless, constant recycling of water through constructed wetlands may increase soluble salts to levels that require subcanopy application of irrigation for effective crop production". </s>
<s n="s6.11;p4.20">The same study shows that overhead irrigation method had negative impact on nursery crops when recycling water was used. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p4.20">The damage obviously caused due to high salt concentrations in irrigation water contacting the foliage. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p4.20">In any case recycled water must be carefully managed in order to avoid foliage damage of crops. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p4.20">Moreover, according to Garber <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s10.11;p4.20">(2002), grass strips can be used to reduce nutrient transfer to collection basins. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p4.20">In some cases also, recycled water must be treated by acid injection to control pH. </s>
</p>

<head rend="bold italic">4. Irrigation systems</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">4.1 Overhead and trickle systems</head>
<p n="p5.20">
<s n="s1.12;p5.20">Irrigation systems are also very essential for the efficient use of water. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p5.20">Overhead irrigation is the most common form of nursery irrigation. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p5.20">It is a flexible and cheap method. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p5.20">The volume of water can flexibly be adjusted and for this reason the ground does not have to be specially graded. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p5.20">However, overhead irrigation systems are inefficient in terms of water use. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p5.20">For example, the area where an overhead irrigation system applies water is not totally covered by pots. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p5.20">Therefore, one part of the applied water falls on the ground. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p5.20">Also, the whole area must be watered long enough to ensure that the least well watered plants receive adequate water. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p5.20">Colangelo <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s10.12;p5.20">(2001), point out that trickle irrigation can significantly increase water application efficiency when compared with overhead irrigation, because water is delivered directly to the medium. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p5.20">Cyclic micro-irrigation in trickle systems also has been shown to increase water use efficiency in container production systems compared with non cyclic systems. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p5.20">In cyclic irrigation, plant's daily water allotments are divided into a series of application events throughout the day. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">4.2 Capillary irrigation</head>
<p n="p6.20">
<s n="s1.6;p6.20">A research carried out by Goodwin <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.20">(2003), shows that capillary irrigation is more efficient in terms of water use, compared with drip and overhead irrigation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.20">On the other hand, the electrical conductivity of medium (EC) in overhead watering is more evenly distributed in relation to both drip and capillary irrigation. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.20">This study indicates also that plants grown with capillary irrigation have sparse roots near the upper surface of the mix, due to higher EC in the surface layers of the pots. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.20">Therefore, shallow-rooted plants do not indicate optimum growth in capillary systems, especially when fertilizer is applied on the surface of the mix. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.20">Finally, this research shows that for optimum growth in capillary systems, especially for shallow-rooted plants, we need to use controlled-release fertilizer which must be mixed through the medium. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">4.3 Ebb and flow benches &amp; sand beds</head>
<p n="p7.20">
<s n="s1.5;p7.20">Sub-irrigation systems, such as ebb and flow benches and sand beds, are very water efficient in relation to overhead irrigation, using 20% or less of the water of an overhead system. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p7.20">This is mostly due to the fact that almost all the water supplied is potentially available to the plants. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p7.20">Although, sub-irrigation systems have been researched for decades, they are not broadly adopted because of weed growth, algae growth and plant rooting into the bed. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p7.20">However, Zheng <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p7.20">(2004), point out that the major drawback of this technique is the salt accumulation at the substrate surface. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.20">
<s n="s1.10;p8.20">Sub-irrigation results in a significant accumulation of salts within the top third of plant growth substrate. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p8.20">In order to avoid phytotoxic salt accumulation in sub-irrigated crops, a reduction in fertilizer concentrations would be necessary. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.20">Zheng et <hi rend="italic"> al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.20">(2004), suggest that macronutrient concentrations used by greenhouse growers can be significantly reduced without having any negative effect on growth and quality. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.20">The same research indicates that if substrate pH levels can be adequately maintained under lower EC conditions and lower fertilizer application rates, it may be possible to reduce fertilization without reducing crop production. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.20">However, if the nutrient level is too low, nutrient deficiency, such as N and K, may occur. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.20">Fe deficiency is also very likely to occur in very low nutrient concentrations, mostly due to elevated pH levels of growth substrates. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.20">Obviously, we need to find a balance between providing adequate nutrients and reducing the potential for phytotoxic salt accumulation. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.20">The reduction also of nutrient concentrations, without reducing crop production and quality, is crop dependent. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p8.20">It is finally very important to redistribute nutrient salts to the lower sections of the pot by using periodically overhead fertigation. </s>

<head rend="bold">4.4 Plant-demand based irrigation</head>
<p n="p9.20">
<s n="s1.3;p9.20">'Plant-demand based' irrigation management strategies are under development to provide solutions to the problems of water use efficiency. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.20">This technology tries to determine the water requirements of crops by using substrate moisture sensors and irrigation models based on reference evapotranspiration. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.20">However, commercial availability of these options is very poor (Beeson <hi rend="italic">et al.,</hi> 2004). </s>

<head rend="bold italic">5. Potential commercial impact of water efficient management strategies</head>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">5.1 Commercial impact of the reuse of runoff water</head>
<p n="p10.20">
<s n="s1.7;p10.20">According to Beeson <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.20">(2004), the use of recycled water has dramatically increased the presence of root rot in some container nurseries, due to high salt concentrations. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.20">Additionally, since the land area for most nurseries is frequently limited (a majority of nurseries are located within the influence of urban centers), the construction of collection and storage basins is uneconomical in many areas. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.20">Furthermore, the construction structures for water collection must be overlaid with waterproof materials increasing costs significantly. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.20">Finally, treatments for the improvement of runoff water quality (construction of wetlands, filtration and control of pathogens) are an important part of recirculation cost. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.20">On the other hand, as availability of water from public surface waters and groundwater declines, nurseries will adopt methods and technologies to increase water use efficiency. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.20">The adoption of collection basins, micro-irrigation and sub-irrigation from the larger nurseries is undoubtedly of major importance. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold">5.2 Commercial impact of water efficient irrigation systems</head>
<p n="p11.20">
<s n="s1.3;p11.20">It is worth mentioning that water efficient irrigation systems have several other economical and environmental benefits besides lower water requirements. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.20">Lower nutrient requirements (because of reduced nutrient leaching), disease prevention (from foliage wetting), weeds prevention (from over watering of substrates), improved plant quality (controlled growth, uniform plants), fewer plant losses (from over or under watering), flexibility in pot sizing and spacing, savings in labor (for hand watering), and reduction of nutrients runoff to surrounding ecosystems are some of the benefits (Zheng <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.20">2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.20">
<s n="s1.9;p12.20">Recirculating sub-irrigation can become increasingly popular in the greenhouse industry. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p12.20">Zheng <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.9;p12.20">(2004), claim that lower nutrient requirements in recirculating sub-irrigation systems can lead to significant fertilizer savings. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p12.20">Sub-irrigation also delivers nutrients to pots in a uniform manner, improving crop appearance and uniformity which are very desirable in ornamental production. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p12.20">Moreover, a study by O'Neill and McQuilken (2000), indicates that ornamental crops grown with reduced leaf wetness are less infected from grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), which is a very common disease in ornamental greenhouse crops. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p12.20">The same study indicated also that both drip and overhead irrigation create favorable conditions for botrytis. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p12.20">Overhead irrigation causes leaf wetness due to direct contact of water with plant canopy which is extremely advantageous to botrytis infection. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p12.20">Drip irrigation also creates humid microclimate in the plant canopy, especially in the plant base, sufficient to permit botrytis infection. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p12.20">On the other head, sub-irrigation creates unfavorable conditions to fungi infections, so that it can be a useful tool for reducing disease risk and adopting integrated management of grey mould in ornamental greenhouse plants. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">6. Conclusion</head>
<p n="p13.20">
<s n="s1.6;p13.20">Many solutions about water conservation have already been researched and have been proved to be advantageous for both the environment and greenhouse industry. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.20">Recycling the nursery runoff water for irrigation has benefits in using a resource that would otherwise be discarded and wasted. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.20">Thus, using recycled water reduces the pressures on the environment by reducing the use of environmental waters. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.20">There are factors that need to be considered, including the cost of recirculation of runoff water and salinity. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.20">Moreover, application methods and irrigation systems can be further controlled providing more efficient use of water. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.20">Ongoing research and development will also improve and increase the use of sub-irrigation systems which are very water conserving. </s>
