<s n="s3.4;p1.64">Suffice to say, each part had been studied by researchers into extent, which helps us to diagnose, and now treat, many debilitating disorders. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.64">On a reasonably small scale, myopia and hyperopia can be corrected easily with glasses, but this has taken a step further with the introduction of laser eye surgery. </s>

<p n="p2.64">
<s n="s1.1;p2.64">Corneal implants can restore sight in patients whose cornea have clouded, likewise, lens replacements can provide a cure for cataracts, a symptom of old age, alcoholism and diabetes. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p3.64">The most interesting development will be artificial impulse creation, that could enable completely blind and partially sighted individuals to have some sight stimulation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.64">This implant will improve the qualities of lives of countless individuals, and so it is important to further understanding of the optic nerve system, and conversion of these signals to produce an image, within the occipital lobe of the brain. </s>

<p n="p24.64">
