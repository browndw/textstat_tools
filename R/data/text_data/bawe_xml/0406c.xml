<p n="p6.54">
<s n="s1.2;p6.54">A histogram of the log returns seemed to suggest that the Normal distribution was not a good fit for the log return data, with slight signs of kurtosis being present and the distribution of the data having extremely long tails. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p11.54">(iv) The dependency of the log returns can be examined through the autocorrelations of the series. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.54">Linear and non-linear dependency is a key aspect in selecting a model for a series. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.54">With the log return series there is some clear indication of significance at lag 1, suggesting that the value of the log return does depend somewhat on the previous value. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.54">There are a few more results following this, suggesting that the ten or so previous values have some effect, but after this period the autocorrelation of the series dies away, with later significant values just being the effect of natural variation rather than a truly important result. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p12.54">There appears to be some limited linear dependency in the series, but only short memory. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p12.54">The autocorrelation graph shows that there is considerable dependency in the squared log returns, and that this dependency does not die out over the course of the series. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p13.54">The partial autocorrelation function of the squares of the log returns confirms this picture to some degree. </s>

</p>
<p n="p14.54">
<s n="s1.5;p14.54">In summary, there is some very low-order linear dependence in the log returns, mainly on the previous (lag 1) value in the series. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p14.54">An examination of the non-linear dependency in the series gives a very clear indication that some is present. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.54">The dependency does not die out quickly, suggesting the possibility of very long memory dependence in the series. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.54">However, the evidence is not definitive - there may be long memory non-linear dependence or the high level of significance of the autocorrelations could be a result of a trend in the series which has not been removed by taking the log returns. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p14.54">The dependency of the series has some effect on the modelling process - the presence of only a little linear autocorrelation and dramatic non-linear autocorrelation could indicate that an ARCH(1) or similar model may be a suitable one for the log returns. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p15.54">(v) Volatility is another important aspect in selecting a model for a series. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p15.54">From the standard time series plot of the log returns, it seemed apparent that there was volatility present in the log returns from the changing amplitude throughout the series. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p15.54">A clearer picture of this can be given by plotting the absolute values of the log returns. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p15.54">This is slightly easier to interpret than just a simple examination of the amplitude of the log returns. </s>

<p n="p16.54">
<s n="s1.4;p16.54">This seems to concur with the visual interpretation of the log returns. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.54">There are three or four peaks of high volatility within the series, with a succession extreme positive and negative log returns at these points. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.54">It also confirms that the amplitude does change throughout the series, with a period in the middle of the series of clear low amplitude log returns. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.54">A further examination of this can be offered by smoothing the above plot gives confirmation of the peaks of volatility in the series. </s>

<p n="p18.54">
<s n="s1.4;p18.54">The smoothed line is not flat and dips considerably in the centre of the scatter plot, indicating that there is volatility in the series. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.54">This indicates that the values following a return that is close to zero generally have a smaller amplitude than those found following extreme returns. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.54">This is particularly true for values following extreme positive returns - these typically have a much higher amplitude than returns found elsewhere, indicating that high positive returns are typically followed by periods of high volatility. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.54">It is possible that the extreme positive return is skewing this picture slightly but the curve still shows signs of curving upward even with the removal of this value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.54">
<s n="s1.5;p19.54">Both approaches to volatility indicate pretty clear that there is volatility present in the series. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p19.54">There are several periods of volatility and a structural volatility plot indicates that volatility usually follows extreme positive returns. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p19.54">With this in mind, a linear model for the series is not a good choice for the data - a linear model takes no account of volatility in the series, assuming that the variation is constant throughout. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p19.54">This has been demonstrated to not be the case here. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p19.54">Therefore proceeding to non-linear modelling seems to be the best choice, as a non-linear model should take into account the changing variation in the data. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p20.54">(vi) The log return series was imported into ITSM and adjusted for the mean of the series in preparation for modelling. </s>

</p>
<p n="p21.54">
<s n="s1.9;p21.54">An ARCH(1) model might be initially considered for the series. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p21.54">The log returns have clear signs of volatility, so for the reasons described previously a linear model would not be an appropriate choice. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p21.54">An ARCH model should have no linear dependency and some brief non-linear dependency at the start of the series. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p21.54">The log returns showed some linear dependency, although there was not much. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p21.54">While it did show some clear non-linear dependency, this dependency persisted rather than being short memory as is the case with a theoretical ARCH model. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p21.54">Nonetheless, the ARCH(1) model seems a good starting point, with similar autocorrelation and volatility characteristics. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p21.54">Furthermore, an ARCH(1) model is a good starting point for GARCH modelling as it is the simplest in the series. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p21.54">Starting from here and adding additional terms as necessary will allow a parsimonious model to be produced rather than including unnecessary complex terms at the start. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p21.54">An ARCH(1) model was fitted to the data, first using the Gaussian assumption and the GARCH facility in ITSM. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p25.54">Since the distribution of the log returns seriously deviated from the Gaussian distribution and instead appeared to conform much better to the t-distribution, this is unlikely to produce a good model for the log returns. </s>

<s n="s4.4;p30.54">It is worth nothing that an ARCH model does not take into account the volatility of previous values in the series and the evidence of continued periods of volatility in the residuals may indicate that a GARCH model would be a better choice. </s>
