<head rend="underlined">1.1 - Disc Brakes</head>
<p n="p5.61">
<s n="s1.4;p5.61">Disc brakes are a type of friction brake in which the braking forces are generated by the pressure of a high friction brake pad, against the surface of a rotating disc, or brake rotor. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.61">There are two types of disc brake in use, namely fixed caliper and floating calliper disc brakes. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.61">Floating caliper disc brakes utilise a single piston which presses the brake pad against the rotating disc. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.61">The reaction force causes the caliper housing to shift to the right, pressing the remaining brake pad against the opposite face of the disc (see fig.1) </s>

<s n="s1.6;p6.61">Upon release of the brake, piston seals with defined deformation properties retract the piston from the brake. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.61">The fixed caliper system however, uses a separate piston to actuate each brake pad on each face of the disc. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.61">Although the fixed caliper disc brake is the simplest in terms of manufacture, and is the stronger of the two types, the system has been eliminated by the floating caliper design, since many road vehicles are restricted by available space and the floating caliper system provides a compact alternative. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.61">In addition, the fixed caliper disc system is found to be sensitive to high temperatures caused by prolonged use, which can result in brake failure due to overheating brake fluid. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.61">The floating caliper system is found to be far less sensitive to high temperatures, and consequently, this type of brake failure is uncommon. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p6.61">As a result, the floating caliper system is most commonly applied to motor vehicles due to its compact dimensions, and reliability. </s>

<quote lang="English">Akebono recognizes every caliper must be harmonized with its brake pad materials to optimize performance. Our unique product development approach ensures the caliper design is in tune with each vehicle application. This careful attention to detail guarantees the caliper is integrated with other brake system components to optimize pedal feel and NVH performance, as well as maximize caliper performance over the life of the vehicle.</quote>
<figure id="BAWE_0250g-pic.006"/>
<quote lang="English">For example, we carefully match the piston seal rollback and caliper stiffness to the friction material's characteristics. We also design the brake pad shape specifically to reduce noise, and match the pad area and volume with power absorption to meet or exceed lining life requirements. Other Akebono caliper technology innovations include our fully sealed caliper slide mechanism and corrosion-protected pad slides. We design the caliper's sealed two-piece pins for minimal taper wear and reduced drag. This improves lining life and helps reduce judder and noise. The pins are greased and sealed for life. During relining, a pin's pinch bolts can be removed without contaminating the slide mechanism. The clearance pin's large bushing prevents housing rattle and our pin design that overhangs the rotor eliminates the need for outboard housing support.</quote>

<quote lang="English">Akebono's caliper slide mechanism uses a close-fit, metal-to-metal guide system that is spring loaded between the pads and anchor bracket to prevent pad rattle. No spring load exists on the caliper body. The brake pad slides in female guide slots which provide consistent contact points for reaction loads. Stainless steel pad springs line the abutment contact area and maintain low pad slide load in a corrosive environment.</quote>

<quote lang="English">Our caliper pad retraction springs are v-springs that separate the pads and keep them in contact with caliper fingers and pistons. This design reduces residual drag and can be applied to sliding or opposed piston calipers.</quote>

<quote lang="English">During design and development, Akebono tests calipers for leakage, fluid displacement, deflection, noise, strength and endurance. We are the only company in the industry that tests 100 percent of all our calipers in production for residual drag. To the customer, this means minimal brake pulsation and optimized pedal feel.<hi rend="bold"> NVH SOLUTIONS</hi> Akebono's world-class brake R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities deliver customized brake noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) solutions for our customers. Extensive NVH testing and analysis capabilities produce disc pads and drum brake linings featuring outstanding noise control and longer life.<hi rend="bold"> ROTOR KINDNESS</hi> Akebono's innovative friction materials are less abrasive to rotors than any others in the market. The result? A decrease in disc thickness variation, resulting in minimal roughness. We also increase rotor life by reducing the amount of high-hardness raw materials. In addition, our friction material generates much less wheel dust.</quote>
<figure id="BAWE_0250g-fig.001"/>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="bold">FRICTION (µ) STABILITY</hi> The difference in µ between a normal stop and panic stop with Akebono's technology is typically less than 10 percent compared with our competition, who may lose 30 percent or more. This means predictable, safe performance when it is needed most.</quote>
<figure id="BAWE_0250g-fig.002"/>
<quote lang="English">
<hi rend="bold">SYSTEM APPROACH</hi> Akebono knows friction materials play an integral role in a vehicle's braking system. We apply a total system approach to designing and manufacturing our friction products, carefully analyzing their interaction with a vehicle's brake calipers and rotors. Optimum performance of brake disc pads and linings involves a complex interaction of raw material components combined with an exact production process to maximize braking consistency.</quote>
