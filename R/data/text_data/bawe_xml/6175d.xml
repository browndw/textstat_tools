<s n="s1.8;p1.17">Over the last several years, many chemists worldwide have tried to form desired products by stimulating chemical reaction. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p1.17">Traditionally, control agents used in chemical synthesis are microscopic variables. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p1.17">They change such variables like pressure, temperature and concentration or combine reagents in such a process. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p1.17">These stimuli cannot yield products by changing such thermodynamic variables and the combination of reagents also forms unwanted byproducts (Dahleh et al., 1996). </s>
<s n="s5.8;p1.17">One possible way to deal with this problem is to control the motion of molecular in chemical reaction. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p1.17">Since the invention of ultrafast laser technology, it is possible to control the motion of atoms, molecules, nuclei or even electrons by using the laser pulse shaping techniques. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p1.17">The duration of the shortest pulse changed from the nanosecond regime to the femtosecond regime. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p1.17">The reason for this is that the maximum speed of electronic light modulation device limits direct shaping in time to nanosecond regime (Krumpert, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.5;p2.17">Currently, femtosecond laser pulses can be generated directly from an optically pumped Ti:sapphire Kerr lens mode-locked laser oscillator (Krumpert, 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.17">With the advancement in femtosecond laser technology, a large number of scientists attempt to develop optical methods which use coherent light source or laser radiation to manipulate and control the outcome of chemical reactions in the gas and liquid phase by mean of controlling the behaviour of atoms and molecules. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.17">To achieve this, chemical bonds on a microscopic level can be broken or made suitably without harmful byproducts. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.17">The optimal approach using in this process is the computer-controlled femtosecond laser pulses shaping combined with learning algorithms in feedback loop or a self-learning loop. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.17">These algorithms called evolutionary algorithms are used to optimise the shapes of such laser pulses with durations on the same time scale as the motion of the atoms or molecules. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.7;p3.17">Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a set of global, parallel, search and optimization methods, which mimic the biological process of natural evolution. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p3.17">The term of evolutionary algorithms was adopted to describe the algorithms like evolutionary programming (EP) by Fogel, Owen and Walsh, evolution strategies (ES) by Rechenberg and Schwefel, genetic algorithms (GA) by Holland, genetic programming (GP) by Koza and classifier systems (Michalewicz and Fogel, 2000). </s>
<s n="s3.7;p3.17">Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the idea of evolution using the principles of natural selection. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p3.17">These methods are robust tools, which is able to tacking the problems that cannot be solved by using conventional means. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p3.17">The main benefit of this optimization method in molecular control is no requirement of priori knowledge of the mechanism of the complex system. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.17">This essay will describes in what way the evolutionary algorithm methodology has been applied to molecular control. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p3.17">Fundamental of evolutionary algorithms will be firstly described and then evolutionary algorithms in adaptive femtosecond pulse shaping as well as optimal quantum control will be described later. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p4.17">Evolutionary algorithms are a class of search methods with noticeable balance between exploitation of the best solutions and exploration of the search space. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p4.17">This methodology combines elements of directed and stochastic search. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p4.17">They are, therefore, more robust than existing directed search methods (Michalewicz, 1999). </s>
<s n="s4.7;p4.17">Evolutionary algorithms simulate the natural selection process by using a number (population) of random individuals (potential solutions to the problem) to evolve through certain procedures. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p4.17">Each individual within the population is represented through some form of genetic code as a string of numbers (bit strings, integer, or floating point numbers) in similar way with chromosomes in nature. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p4.17">Each individual's quality within the population is represented by a fitness function tailored to the problem to be optimised. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p4.17">In other words, a fitness value expresses how good the solution to the problem is. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.17">
<s n="s1.10;p5.17">Evolutionary algorithms begin to work by generating randomly the initial chromosome population with their genes taking values inside the desired constrained space. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p5.17">Each individual's fitness function is then evaluated after Initialisation of population. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p5.17">A set of stochastic genetic operators, manipulating the genetic code is used to perform evolution. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p5.17">Such operators are applied to the population, simulating the according natural processes. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p5.17">These operators are selection, recombination and mutation, which are used to provide the next generation chromosomes. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p5.17">The recombination known as crossover operator creates new chromosomes (offspring) by the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (parents) or different potential solution to the problem. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p5.17">Two randomly selected chromosomes are divided in the same (random) position, whereas the first part of the one is connected to the second part of the second one, and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p5.17">The mutation operator creates new chromosomes by a small change in a randomly selected gene of a chromosome. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.17">This operator is used to introduce some extra variability into the population. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p5.17">The process of a new generation evaluation and creation is successively repeated, providing individuals with high values of fitness function. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p6.17">A lot of research in the field of quantum control was developed remarkably, resulting from the implementation of femtosecond laser pulse shaping, combined with learning loop. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.17">Femtosecond Fourier-domain laser pulse shaping has been developed by Weiner and his colleagues (Weiner et al., 1992) and refined by Wafers and Nelson (Wafers and Nelson, 1995). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.17">Fourier transform pulse shapers using spatial light modulators, based on spatial masking of the spatially dispersed optical frequency spectrum, play a vital role in controlling the waveforms of ultrafast optical pulse (Weiner, 2000). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.17">Several different types of spatial light modulators have been used for femtosecond laser pulse shaping, including liquid crystal modulator arrays (LCMs) (Weiner et al., 1992; Wafers and Nelson, 1995), acousto-optic modulator (AOM) (Hillegas, 1994) and deformable mirrors (Garduno-Mejia et al., 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.17">
<s n="s1.13;p7.17">The experimental implementation of the design of laser sequences which have the ability to drive a reaction into a desired final state has been difficult to achieve. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p7.17">This is because of the complicated nature of molecular Hamiltonians. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p7.17">The theoretical approach using optimal control theory to solve the problem of quantum control of chemical reactions requires precise knowledge of molecular Hamiltonian. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p7.17">Currently, the molecular Hamiltonian can only be calculated to solve Schrödinger's equation for small model systems which contain up to two or three atoms. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p7.17">This approach, however, limits for chemically relevant larger or more complicated molecules because the accuracy of such calculated or measured molecular potential energy surfaces is not sufficient. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p7.17">Another problem is the uncertainties of experimental apparatus; hence, it is not technically feasible to generate the complex laser fields exactly the same as laser fields which is demanded by the theory. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p7.17">This may cause the errors of laser pulse generation. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p7.17">The design based on an approximate Hamiltonian may not be robust. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p7.17">A solution to this problem was proposed by Judson and Rabitz in their work called 'Teaching Lasers to Control Molecules' (Judson and Rabitz, 1992). </s>
<s n="s10.13;p7.17">This technique includes the output of the experiment in the optimization algorithm as closed loop feedback system in a learning algorithm. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p7.17">The basic idea of this technique is that the quantum control system itself guides an automated search, via a learning loop, for a suitable coherent light fields or optimal laser field. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p7.17">Such a methodology can iteratively improve the shape of the applied laser pulses until an optimum is reached by using the system itself to solve its Schrödinger's equation under the given constraints or laboratory conditions in real-time. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p7.17">Their approach use genetic algorithms to search for the optimal laser field in iteration loop. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.17">
<s n="s1.10;p8.17">As a result of this technique, Baumert and his colleagues suggested a novel experimental methodology to reduce the effort to find the optimal laser pulse (Baumert et al., 1997). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p8.17">This research emphasizes on femtosecond laser pulses compressed by a computer controlled pulse shaping apparatus using an evolutionary algorithm with feedback loop to control a programmable liquid crystal spatial light modulator based on the design of Weineral. (Weiner et al., 1992). </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.17">This technique requires no previous knowledge of intensity or phase profile of femtosecond laser pulses. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.17">Such a technique is extremely useful in the field of short pulse microscopy, two photon microscopy, ultrafast soft X-ray generation, in particular ultrashort spectroscopy such as femtosecond quantum control of chemical reactions. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.17">Another example of femtosecond laser pulse shapers with learning algorithms used for automated pulse compression is reported by Brixner and his coworkers (Brixner et al., 1999). </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.17">In this experiment, a femtosecond laser pulse shaper based on a liquid crystal display spatial light modulator together with a feedback-controlled evolutionary algorithm was used to optimise complex phase-modulated laser pulses. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.17">This leads to bandwidth-limited amplified laser pulses. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.17">Feedback-controlled femtosecond laser pulse shaping has been developed later by Brixner and his colleagues (Brixner et al., 2000). </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.17">The combination of a frequency domain phase shaper with an evolutionary algorithm and different pulse characterization methods can compensate for any phase deviation. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p8.17">In the design of arbitrary laser pulse shapes, an evolutionary algorithm can be employed to optimise generation of arbitrary laser pulse shapes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.17">
<s n="s1.14;p9.17">Quantum systems and quantum-mechanical wave functions are three-dimensional objects, but conventional pulse shaping accesses only the scalar properties of ultrashort laser pulses. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p9.17">The control of the vectorial properties of the electric laser field by the use of polarization as active agent can access the three-dimensional dynamics of quantum-mechanical wave functions (Brixner et al., 2001). </s>
<s n="s3.14;p9.17">A novel computer-controlled femtosecond pulse shaping technique was, therefore, introduced. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p9.17">In this methodology, the polarization state of light, the temporal intensity and the momentary oscillation frequency can be manipulated as a function of time within a single femtosecond. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p9.17">This research uses a pulse shaper with a 256-pixel two-layer liquid-crystal display inside a zero-dispersion compressor to modulate the degree of polarization ellipticity and the orientation of the elliptical principal axes within a single laser pulse. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p9.17">Brixner and his coworkers also demonstrated the generation and complete characterization of polarization-shaped femtosecond laser pulses (Brixner et al., 2002). </s>
<s n="s7.14;p9.17">In this experiment, the light polarization, the temporal intensity and the momentary frequency were arbitrarily changed within a single pulse. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p9.17">The generation and analysis of polarization-shaped femtosecond laser pulses was then combined with the optimization algorithm within a learning loop and the experimental feedback (Brixner et al., 2003). </s>
<s n="s9.14;p9.17">This experiment uses second-harmonic generation (SHG) to serves as a feedback signal in the learning algorithm. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p9.17">An evolutionary algorithm is used to iteratively improve the phase-modulated and polarization-modulated laser pulses. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p9.17">Two optimization strategies were compared in this experiment: phase-only shaping and polarization shaping. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p9.17">The optimization results of polarization shaping are better than that of phase-only shaping. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p9.17">The experimental implementation of shaping of femtosecond polarization profiles within an adaptive learning loop raises the possibility of generation of femtosecond light field in which the scalar and the vectorial properties are optimised automatically. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p9.17">This methodology can be also applied for adaptive polarization quantum control experiment with the feedback signal taken from quantum system itself. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p10.17">There is a large amount evidence of the progress in using evolutionary algorithms for optimal quantum control in order to control the molecule in chemical reaction. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p10.17">Feedback quantum control of the electronic population transfer in a dye molecule is one of such evidence. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p10.17">Traditionally, time domain quantum control needs the calculations of quantum dynamic to find the optimal laser field. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.17">This method requires knowledge of the molecular potential energy surfaces, whereas feedback quantum control in a molecular system uses a computer program based on genetic algorithms to analyses the experimental output from detector in order to optimise population transfer from ground to first excited state and then control an acousto-optic pulse shaping device in order to excite fluorescence from the laser dye molecule IR125 in methanol solution (Bardeen et al., 1997). </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.17">The advantage of feedback quantum control is no requirement of a priori knowledge of the molecule's potential energy surfaces. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.17">Another advantage of such an approach is that the optimal solution given constraint can be automatically found by a control computer with optimization algorithms. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p10.17">This feedback control approach might be extended to several physical and chemical processes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.17">
<s n="s1.8;p11.17">Some research, however, shows that the achievement of the optimization without dealing with the electronic population transfer within the parent molecule is possible. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p12.17">The evidence shows that Fe(CO)<hi rend="sub">5</hi> dissociation reaction cannot be describe as intensity-dependent. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p12.17">This is because a completely different behaviour results from different types of intensity variation. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p12.17">In other words, the change in intensity by the variation of pulse duration leads to a behavior opposite intensity alteration by the variation of pulse energy. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p12.17">This is called 'problem of inversion'. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p12.17">Furthermore, second- harmonic generation (SHG) can be used after the output of a 800 nm pulse shaper to implement 400 nm phase-shaped laser pulses automate coherent control experiments. </s>
