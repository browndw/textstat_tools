<item>System openness and shared data must be maximised to a point, but protected data that is defined as secret must be hidden from disclosure to third-party contractors.</item>

<item>Data flowing through the architecture needs to be defined as Shared and Protected;</item>

<s n="s1.2;p26.31">As part of the investigation into the domain of our organisation and it's business (roadside repair), I am convening a meeting of those stakeholders concerned with the need to improve communication to our on-the-road repair crews. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p26.31">It is intended that this aspect of our business be thoroughly reviewed and a study undertaken to assess how it can be improved by the application of Information Technology. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.31">
<s n="s1.1;p27.31">This workshop aims to achieve the following: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Fully specify the nature of the problem(s), when, how and why the communication breakdowns or difficulties are occurring;</item>
<item>Identify those parties, both in terms of job roles and technological components that are concerned, and their strengths and weaknesses;</item>
<item>Determine what is needed to make fast, efficient, accurate and secure communications, in a specified format and structure, a reality.</item>
</list>
<p n="p28.31">
<s n="s1.2;p28.31">This meeting is to take place on <hi rend="bold"> Friday 10th February 2006</hi> at 11:30am in the Green meeting room. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Examine at least 2 of the other architectures/frameworks discussed in lecture 8 and decide whether you agree with the statement "Architecture is simply applied common sense?". Make sure that you support your answer by reference to the characteristics of the architectures/frameworks you select and the characteristics of TOGAF. </head>
<p n="p29.31">
<s n="s1.4;p29.31">Enterprise IT Architecture, and its development, is often regarded as being nothing more than a structured, specified method of applying common sense to the introduction of information systems into an organisation to support its functions and activities. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.31">After examining a number of architecture frameworks, specifically, the Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the US Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and the Zachman commercial framework, this Author is of the opinion that this statement is largely true. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.31">This, however, is not to de-value architecture principles. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.31">Common sense is frequently the first thing to go 'out of the window' in development of complicated systems, particularly IT architectures, with many participants succumbing to an only-too-human tendency to look right past common assumptions and truths that are right under their noses. </s>
</p>
<p n="p30.31">
<s n="s1.3;p30.31">The US Government uses the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework to develop, manage and modify its systems using a business-driven approach, by viewing its services and functions as business products and activities. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p30.31">This comes from its common ancestry shared with TOGAF. Its characteristics are very similar to those of other Architecture Development Models and Frameworks - it focuses on providing a structured way of describing baselines, technical reference models, and data models that are tailored towards the work of government departments and the communications and commonalities between them, and is linked to capital planning and government strategy. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p30.31">This is a prime example of the application of common sense - differing government departments may implement systems that meet their needs without considering how their systems may interact with the systems of other departments - all FEAF does it to structure this logic and reasoning and present it in a highly systematic, methodised format. </s>
</p>
<p n="p31.31">
<s n="s1.2;p31.31">Similarly, the commercially-available Zachman framework for classifying and defining artefacts (the 'building blocks' of TOGAF) organises data and applications into matrices that allow business scenarios and opportunities for introducing technology to aid them to be extracted and specified. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.31">Zachman is primarily concerned with eliciting and encapsulating these elements or artefacts but does not provide a specified ADM like TOGAF or FEAF. Again though, the framework provided by Zachman merely provides a way of thinking and a structured process for determining and grouping activities, information flow, assumptions and constraints that are widely known throughout the business, but not easily brought together without applying a great deal of common sense to link sometimes seemingly unrelated activities. </s>
