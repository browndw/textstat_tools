<s n="s1.2;p1.27">To study the relationship between the marginal propensity to consume and the investment multiplier, we have to invest the flow of income and expensive first. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.27">To see the economy as a whole, income equals expenditure and also equals the value of output, we study the circular flow of income and expenditure. </s>

<p n="p2.27">
<s n="s1.4;p2.27">Firms sell and households buy consumer goods and services in the market. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.27">The aggregate payment that households make for those goods and services is consumption expenditure. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.27">On the other hand, households sell and firms buy the services of labour, capital and land in the factor markets. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.27">Firms pay income to households---wages for labour services, interest for the use of capital and rent for the use of land. </s>

<p n="p3.27">
<s n="s1.11;p3.27">We do not plan to spend all that we earn. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p3.27">A proportion is usually saved (a leakage). </s>
<s n="s3.11;p3.27">For example, assume that out of every pound we earn, we save 10p and spend 90p. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p3.27">Thus consumption (C) is equal to 0.9 times amount of disposable income (Y <hi rend="sub">d</hi>), which is income earned minus taxes, i.e. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p3.27">C=0.9Y <hi rend="sub">d</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p3.27">0.9 referred to as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). </s>
<s n="s7.11;p3.27">It is the fraction of each extra pound of disposable income that household wish to consume.1-0.9=0.1 referred to as the marginal propensity to save (MPS). </s>
<s n="s8.11;p3.27">Sometimes firms make investment by purchasing new plant, equipment and buildings. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p3.27">These are things added to stock (injection) and bought with money that will be earned in the future. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p3.27">Firms finance their investment by borrowing from households in financial markets. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p3.27">Households place their saving and firms do their borrowing in the financial markets. </s>

<p n="p4.27">
<s n="s1.5;p4.27">When investment changes, firms will use this money to buy additional inputs from households. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.27">Households spend some of this extra money. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.27">Firms in receipt of this money buy more inputs from household. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.27">The cycle continues but diminishes with each turn. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.27">The rate at which it diminishes depends on the proportion of income that is saved at each turn. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.27">A change in disposable income leads to changes in consumption expenditure and saving. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.27">Increase in income will increase the consumption expenditure. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.27">Other factors like real interest rate, purchasing power of net assets (assets minus debts) and expected future income also affect. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.27">When the real interest rate falls or when the purchasing power of net assets or expected future income increases, consumption expenditure increases and saving decreases and vice versa. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.27">Investment can also change for many reasons. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.27">A fall in real interest rate might induce firms to increase their planned investment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.27">
<s n="s1.1;p8.27">Actual aggregate expenditure is always equal to real GDP but aggregate planned expenditure is not necessarily equal to actual aggregate expenditure and therefore is not necessarily equal to real GDP. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p9.27">AE changes when C or I or G changes. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p10.27">With no income taxes, real GDP and disposable income increase by the same amount. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p10.27">The increase in disposable income brings an increase in consumption expenditure and the increased consumption expenditure adds even more to the aggregate expenditure. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p10.27">Real GDP and disposable income increase further and so does consumption expenditure. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p10.27">The initial increase in investment brings an even bigger increase in aggregate expenditure because it induces an increase in consumption expenditure. </s>
