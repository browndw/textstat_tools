<ref target="BAWE_3001i-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s2.7;p1.12">Today this prognosis is still a topic of intense debate among paleoanthropologists. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p1.12">All concur that 1.8 million years ago (mya) a group of <hi rend="italic">H. ergaster</hi> or <hi rend="italic">H. erectus</hi> moved out of Africa into Asia, and eventually into Europe. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.12">However, once in these locations opinions were divided by which method these species evolved into <hi rend="italic">H. sapiens</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.12">Two main schools of thought arose in response to this dispute; the Multiregional/Regional Continuity Model, led today by Milford Wolpoff and Alan Templeton, argues that <hi rend="italic">H. erectus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">H. ergaster</hi> left Africa and evolved separately into populations of <hi rend="italic">H. sapiens,</hi> through a range of intermediates species. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.12">Whilst, the Out of Africa/ Replacement theory, proposes that <hi rend="italic">H.sapiens</hi> only originated 200 kya and dispersed out of Africa into other regions of the world, effectively replacing the <hi rend="italic">H.erectus</hi> populations in Asia and <hi rend="italic">H.neanderthalensis</hi> species in Europe when they became extinct. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p1.12">Despite ethnocentric behaviour and attitudes often influencing the interpretation of fossil finds throughout paleoanthropology's history; today those views have become more balanced and the subsequent discoveries of fossils, archaeological evidence and developments in genetics tend to disprove the multi-regional hypothesis and there is a general consensus in favour of the Single Origin model and it is these findings that I will elaborate upon. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.12">In 1964, Louis Leakey discovered a collection of fossils at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, namely a lower jaw, parts of the cranium and hand and foot bones. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.12">These were dated to 1.75 million years (mya), older than the Zinji boisei species Leakey had been investigating with his wife Mary and in April the journal <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> published his findings as the species <hi rend="italic">homo habilis.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.12">Similarly, in 1986 Donald Johanson and Tim White found fragmented skeletal remains, named OH 62, at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania which were typical of <hi rend="italic">H. habilis.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.12">These specimens too showed a reduction in jaw size, a reduction in dentition and an increased brain size from 500cm3 to 640cm3. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.12">The fossil was also dated to 1.75 mya. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.12">
<hi rend="italic">H. habilis</hi> fossils then were showing shared morphological traits of an increase in the height of the cranial vault, an increased thickness of the cranial vault, a decrease in facial prognathism, including the reduction in dentition and increased brain size. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.12">
<s n="s1.6;p3.12">In1984, Richard Leakey uncovered a nearly complete skeleton west of Lake Turkana in Nariokotome, Kenya that was named KNM-WT 15000. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.12">From the complete remains Leakey and his team were able to accurately calculate his height (1.84 m), his brain capacity 880cm3 and date the skeletal matter at 1.6 mya. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.12">It was classified as <hi rend="italic">h. erectus.</hi> </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.12">However, in 1975, KNM-ER 3733 an almost fully intact cranium was discovered at Koobi Fora with a brain size of 850cm3, it was dated at 1.8 mya and it was judged to be another species named; <hi rend="italic">H. ergaster</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.12">These two species shared many morphological traits namely; thick cranial bone, pronounced supraorbital sulcus (brow-ridges), a projecting nasal aperture and an increase in body size; 63 kilos in males and 52 kilos in females, in comparison to <hi rend="italic">h. habilis</hi> males at 52 kilos and females at 32 kilos. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.12">H. erectus/ergaster were the first hominids to appear outside Africa. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.12">
<s n="s1.2;p4.12">Interestingly, in 1907 a mandible was found in Mauer, Germany, it was both robust but had reduced dentition size, suggesting a hybridisation of primitive and modern morphological traits, it was dated at 500 kya. </s>

<hi rend="italic">h. heidelbergensis</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.12">Much later in 1993 finds in Boxgrove, England, revealed a large tibia and some Acheulean tools and was dated at the same date of 500 kya, subsuming it under the <hi rend="italic">h.heidelbergensis</hi> species. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.12">This species was presumed to have evolved in Africa before evolving into <hi rend="italic">h.neanderthalis</hi> in Europe. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.12">Indeed, the mixture of traits does not imply continuity. </s>

<p n="p6.12">
<s n="s1.11;p6.12">Towards the end of the Pleistocene era anatomically modern humans; early <hi rend="italic">homo sapiens,</hi> begin to emerge in the fossil record. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p6.12">These hominids display a reduction in skeletal robustness, fully modern bipedalism, small face, presence of a chin and a large forehead. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p6.12">In 1967 at Omo, Ethiopia, a brain case and post cranial material were recovered and dated to 130 kya . </s>
<s n="s4.11;p6.12">Similar specimens were found at the Klasies River Mouth Cave in South Africa and were dated to 70-120 kya. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p6.12">It is also important to remember the finds in Israel at Skhul and Qafzeh where several partial skeletons were dated at 100 kya. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p6.12">However, the most significant recovery was made in Herto, Ethiopia 2003. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p6.12">Three almost intact crania were unearthed and dated at 160 kya. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p6.12">Not only was this the oldest anatomically modern fossil recovered, it also highlighted a gap of tens of thousands of years between the first evidence in Africa and elsewhere in the world. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p6.12">This timing points to " a wave of advance"<ref target="BAWE_3001i-ftnote.002"/> from east Africa (160kya) to South Africa (100kya), Israel (95kya), East Asia (67 kya) and Europe (47-40 kya.) </s>
<s n="s10.11;p6.12">The similar dates between anatomically modern human fossils found in Africa and the Middle East have also led to conclusions that the two areas formed the same ecological niche. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p6.12">Ultimately, the fossil record highlights a transition from <hi rend="italic">h.habilis</hi> to <hi rend="italic">h.erectus/ergaster</hi> to modern <hi rend="italic">h.sapiens</hi> within Africa. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p7.12">However, the problematic nature of archaeological evidence means it cannot be heavily relied upon. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.12">Most of the archaeological record is too late or to regional to be able to establish adequate correlations. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.12">Indeed, archaic <hi rend="italic">sapiens</hi> and anatomically modern humans were restricted in their choice of materials when constructing tools, as the MSA tool technology is associated with both genus's and as a result it is very difficult to distinguish between the different species handiwork. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.12">Significantly, the use of blade technology, the production and use of pigments, carving of hunting points and evidence of shell fishing can be dated in the archaeological record at 250 kya. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.12">Such technology is not found in Europe until 27 kya, this is a clear indication of behaviour belonging to anatomically modern, dexterous humans situated in Africa. </s>

<s n="s3.3;p8.12">These advances in science have allowed genetics to fill the gaps left in the fossil and archaeological records; it is also vital for determining coalescence dates between anatomically modern humans and ancient <hi rend="italic">sapiens</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.13;p9.12">Unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a closed circular genome and is made up of only 16500 base pairs, in comparison to the 3 billion that comprise the human genome. </s>

<s n="s3.13;p9.12">It only changes via random mutations, it is passed only through the maternal line and it is present in every cell of the body. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p9.12">As a result, mtDNA is relatively simple to decode, is inherited more simply and occurs in large numbers. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p9.12">Therefore, in 1981 Cann, Stoneking and Wilson attempted to analyse the variability of mtDNA from 147 individuals from all regions of the world. </s>

<s n="s7.13;p9.12">These high levels of genetic variation among the African populations implies that anatomically modern humans (amh) arose first in Africa and have therefore had a longer period of time over which to accumulate genetic diversity. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p9.12">Klein continues " the tree turned out to have two main branches - one comprising exclusively Africans and the other some Africans and everyone else," <ref target="BAWE_3001i-ftnote.004"/> thus producing a coalescence date of 200 kya. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p9.12">Matthias Krings and Svante Paabo used this mtDNA technology in 1997 to sequence some mtDNA from the Neanderthal specimen, Feldhofer. </s>

<s n="s12.13;p9.12">This disparity rules out the possibility of interbreeding, as advocated by the multiregional model. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p9.12">It also highlights that where all living humans coalesce to a common ancestor around 400 kya, the coalescence with Neanderthals is closer to 650 kya, showing a 1.2 kya of divergent evolution and clear separation between the lineages, again supporting not continuity but a replacement theory. </s>
