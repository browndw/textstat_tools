Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s3.4;p6.10">The two layers were then allowed to separate and the aqueous layer was run off. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.10">This process was the repeated with a further portion of 2m Sodium hydroxide (25ml) and the two aqueous layers combined. </s>

<p n="p7.10">
<s n="s1.11;p7.10">Aqueous 6M hydrochloric acid (20ml) was added slowly, whilst shaking to the combined aqueous layers. </s>
<s n="s2.11;p7.10">The solution warmed and a white precipitate was formed. </s>
<s n="s3.11;p7.10">The Ph of the solution was taken with indication paper (PH1) to check the Ph was below 2. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p7.10">The mixture was then cooled on ice and the precipitate collected by vacuum filtration. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p7.10">The filtrate was washed with distilled water, and the solid left to dry under suction for 10 minutes. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p7.10">The weight of the crude sample was taken (1.4g) and followingly it was recrystallised from ethanol. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p7.10">The purified product was weighed (0.93g) and a melting point and Ir spectrum taken. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p7.10">Magnesium Sulphate was added to the ethyl acetate (remaining) layer and swirled creating a "snowstorm", This was then filtered at the pump into a pre-weighed round bottomed flask (100ml) washing with ethyl acetate. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p7.10">Following this the solvent was evaporated on the rotary evaporator. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p7.10">Mass of the crude solid was taken (0.8g) and then recrystalised from ethanol/water mix (ethanol added under heat until product dissolved, water added until solution went cloudy, ethanol added to clear solution). </s>
<s n="s11.11;p7.10">Finally weight of the purified product was taken (0.77g) and a melting point and IR spectrum recorded. </s>
