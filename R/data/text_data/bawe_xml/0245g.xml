<s n="s4.7;p4.127">In January 2001, he had an arthroscopic washout, which provided both pain relief and improvement in shoulder function for a period of approximately a year. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p29.127">For <name type="other"/>, the tendon may well have weakened due to age-related degeneration and the long-term, repetitive, heavy-lifting inherent to warehouse work and was thus predisposed to tear when subjected to additional stress such as that involved in the DIY he was carrying out at the time of injury. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p29.127">The tear is mainly of degenerate fibres of the relatively avascular supraspinatus tendon occurring near its insertion, but may extend into the adjacent subscapularis or infraspinatus tendons. </s>
