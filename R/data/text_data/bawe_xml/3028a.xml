<quote lang="English">If different genotypes are associated with the different phenotypes and those phenotypes differ in their ability to reproduce, then the alleles that lead to the development of the favoured phenotype will increase in frequency. Boyd and Silk (2003: 58)</quote>
<p n="p16.38">
<s n="s1.4;p16.38">To illustrate the quote, consider a genetic disease such as Tay-Sachs which usually kills the individual with the homozygous genotype by the age of four. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p16.38">Following, two alleles for every homozygous individual will be removed from the affected population, leaving only heterozygous individuals with the allele of interest. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.38">Therefore substantially lowering the overall gene frequency within the population (unless other selective factors are involved with regard it's original popularity), and increasing the gene frequency of the non-detrimental allele. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.38">
<s n="s1.2;p17.38">The strength and direction of selection depends on the environment it operates in. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.38">If medical care is available for the treatment of a potentially deadly genotype, the strength of selection against the otherwise deleterious allele is negligible. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.38">
<s n="s1.1;p18.38">While the example of deleterious alleles been removed from a population shows how selection changes gene frequencies, it does not show how selection can lead to the evolution of new adaptations, and the change in gene frequencies which ensue from it. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.38">
<s n="s1.2;p19.38">It is important to note all organisms are capable of producing more offspring that can survive (Mathus). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p19.38">Of the offspring that do survive, on average, they are more likely to have an anatomy, physiology or behaviour that better prepares them for the demands of their environment. </s>

<div2>
<head rend="italic">Modern Synthesis &amp; Environmental Variation</head>
<p n="p20.38">
<s n="s1.4;p20.38">The principles of environmental variation are often associated with the 'modern synthesis' a body of theory based on empirical knowledge in the attributed to the biologists Wright, Fisher and Haldane in the 1930s. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p20.38">They were also known as 'Neo-Darwinists', so by called due to the prior popularity of theories based on Mendelian genetics following its own rediscovery and subsequent increase in popularity. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p20.38">Mendel's theories were perceived incompatible with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection at the time. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p20.38">The Neo-Darwinists showed how Mendelian genetics could not be used to explain continuous variation, leading to a Darwinist theory of inheritance, and accounting for the way variation is maintained within a population based on Darwinian natural selection within an environment. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.38">
<s n="s1.1;p21.38">Although, Darwin himself knew nothing about genetics, all his theory of adaptation by natural selection is framed in purely phenotypic terms. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.38">
<s n="s1.6;p22.38">The fundamental theory of modern synthesis basically goes, continuous variation cannot be accounted for by changes of genotype at a locus per trait, as in Mendel's peas. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p22.38">To achieve the varying sizes of physical characteristics seen in a species there must be many different genotypes at many different loci, on different chromosomes (although genes were undiscovered the 1930s, but the principle is parallel). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p22.38">This coupled with the pressures of the environment, some individuals being better or less nourished than other individuals, therefore, aiding or retarding the growth of the physical expressed characteristic in question. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p22.38">For example, the famous example given by Boyd and Silk (2003) of the varieties finches that inhabit the Galapagos, originally studied by Darwin, more recently studied by Peter and Rosemary Grant. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p22.38">The Grants studied the continuous variation involved in the beak depth and width of finches. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p22.38">Their results go to show: </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Continuously varying characters are affected by genes at many loci, each locus having only a small effect on phenotype (2003: 60)</quote>
<p n="p23.38">
<s n="s1.3;p23.38">If there were only a few genes at a couple of loci affecting beak size, with no environmental affects such as nourishment affecting growth, a stratified effect would be observed in the collect information of beak dimensions of different individuals. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.38">Could be analogous to the way we buy our clothes, 'small, medium or large'. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.38">In reality, empirical data shows the majority of expressed characteristics we see as un-stratified, complex gradual continuous variation, with no visible increments amongst data collected. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.38">
<s n="s1.5;p24.38">Environment change and variation have large effects on gene frequencies within populations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.38">Using Darwin's finches again as an example, when the climate changed and drought ensued on Daphne Major, the mean relative beak size of the finches increased due to pressures of natural selection to adapt to the change of available food. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.38">Larger beaked individuals survived better than small beaked individuals due to the increased size and hardness of nut and seed food source. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.38">This therefore increased gene frequencies affecting large beak size and growth. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.38">What is theoretically alleles controlling growth hormones, or calcium supply to the beak. </s>
</p>
<p n="p25.38">
<s n="s1.6;p25.38">Data collected from Daphne Major have shown a positive correlation between beak width and beak depth. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p25.38">Although, this was actually maladaptive. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p25.38">Whatever genotypes were increasing the advantageous trait of beak depth, were also by pleiotropic effect, increasing the beak width at the same time. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p25.38">It turns out selection favoured beak depth, and not beak width. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p25.38">The thinner beak could apply more pressure, than an individual with a wide beak. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p25.38">It therefore follows, as the finches neared selective equilibrium in the environment, the threshold for deletion also included birds with the largest beaks as well as the smallest beaks, altering gene frequencies for large and small beak characteristics. </s>
</p>
<p n="p26.38">
<s n="s1.1;p26.38">Still one of Darwin's problems remains, selection tends to deplete genetic variation when selection reaches adaptive equilibrium. </s>

<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Mutation</head>
<p n="p27.38">
<s n="s1.3;p27.38">Mutations can slowly add new genetic variation to populations and may produce novel phenotypic affects that selection can assemble into adaptation. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.38">But, not all mutations are advantageous, they can also have a deadly affect on the individual, or a neutral undetected affect. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.38">Mutations can be caused by certain forms of ionising radiation, such as X rays, and certain kinds of chemicals that damage the DNA and alter the message that it carries. </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.38">
<s n="s1.4;p28.38">Rates of mutation are very low, Boyd and Silk suggest ranging from 1 in 100000 to 1 in 10 million per locus per gamete in each generation (2003: 66). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p28.38">Boyd and Silk calculate the gene frequency of a single mutation to be 0.000001 (1 in a million new-borns) according to Hardy-Weinberg equations, based on the frequency of deleterious recessive genes being about 1 in 1000. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p28.38">This low-rate of mutation is sufficient to maintain variation within a population at selective equilibrium, and so solve Darwin's problem of selection tending to deplete selection. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p28.38">When mutation introduces enough new mutations to maintain a constant frequency of the gene, it can be said there is selection-mutation balance. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.38">
<s n="s1.10;p29.38">Varying types of events exist in the mutation of somatic cells. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p29.38">Jurmain (1999) gives examples of 'frame-shift mutation', in which, during recombination base(s) can be omitted from the process causing the entire translation of bases into different codons, or amino acids. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p29.38">It is also possible for entire codons that normally contain 'stop' information between genes to be omitted or have the translation changed allowing the joining of genes. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p29.38">Point mutation is a change of a single base at one locus, changing the translation of a single codon, or amino acid. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p29.38">Sickle cell anaemia, is a disease with affects population in tropical regions in which falciparum malaria is prevalent. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p29.38">When the haemoglobin S allele in homozygous in the individual they suffer debilitating anaemia and do not live until adulthood, and so substantial amounts of the allele are removed from each generation. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p29.38">But, it happens in this case that the heterozygous phenotype is actually selected by natural selection, individuals heterozygous with the allele are 15% more likely to reach adulthood than individuals homozygous with the standard haemoglobin A allele. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p29.38">This is because of the resistance heterozygous individuals receive against malaria, although their blood cells do not carry oxygen quite as well homozygous haemoglobin A individuals. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p29.38">A balanced polymorphism is reached when heterozygotes have a higher genetic fitness than either homozygote, a steady rate at which both alleles exist in the population. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p29.38">From this, it can easily be understood how an advantageous single point mutation in an individual gene could be selected to reach substantial gene frequencies within the population (maybe within a few occurrences, over many generation to proliferate.). </s>

<s n="s3.8;p33.38">If a certain locus has roughly equal gene frequencies of two different alleles acting on it, analogy could be pretty much like two people repeatedly flipping a hand full of coins (the population are the individual coins), in turn, guessing if it is heads or tails until one person or the other has won all the coins. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p38.38">Apparently, it is often easy to view a species as being in adaptive equilibrium, when equilibrium is not necessarily reached. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p38.38">The environment of the species could have changed in the recent past. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p38.38">Boyd and Silk give the example the Human species. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p38.38">Since the advent of agriculture and subsequent improved social infrastructure, the supply of sugar, fats and salts has been readily available for many humans. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p38.38">Before agriculture and animal husbandry, it was advantageous for the individual to have a behavioural trait to crave, and eat as much sugar, fat and salt as he could find, living on a diet of wild game, grass seeds and other plant foods. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p38.38">In the modern age it seems natural selection has yet to catch up with the technological advances, will still crave these foods, but today they are not always advantageous. </s>
