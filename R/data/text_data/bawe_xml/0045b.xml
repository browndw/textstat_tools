<s n="s5.9;p16.29">The first of these is electrostatic forces. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p16.29">There are three types of electrostatic interaction, charge to charge, dipole to charge and dipole to dipole interactions. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p16.29">They occur between molecules that are not permanently polar or cannot form hydrogen bonds because they lack the appropriate donor or acceptor groups. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p16.29">They are dependant on the electric charge of the atoms. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p16.29">A type of electrostatic interaction, ion pairs, can exist e.g. between the carboxyl group of Glutamate and the ammonium group of Lysine however these are not very strong attractive forces as the free energies of the species with or without the ion pairs are almost equal. </s>

<p n="p17.29">
<s n="s1.5;p17.29">Secondly Van der Waals forces exist between electrically neutral molecules. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p17.29">They are non-specific attractions and are caused by the fact that the electron density around any given molecule at one particular instant may be unsymmetrical causing a temporary dipole. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p17.29">This then induces an opposite dipole in neighbouring atoms and an attraction will occur between them. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p17.29">The distance of Van der Waals forces is important as if the molecules are too close they will repulse each other and too far away and they will not attract. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p20.29">These play a large role in the formation of the secondary structure, as already discussed, but they also contribute to the tertiary structure. </s>

<s n="s3.9;p20.29">The acceptor group can be Nitrogen, Oxygen, or an Aromatic Ring (e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p20.29">Trp). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p20.29">They encourage the protein to fold in the way that allows the most H bonds to form and hence is most stable. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p20.29">These hydrogen bonds are able to form due to a variation in the electronegativity of atoms, which is an atom's ability to attract electrons. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p20.29">Where an atom that is very electronegative is bonded to an atom that is only slightly electronegative this causes an induced dipole moment and the electron is attracted to the more electronegative atom making that atom slightly negative (δ-). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p20.29">Atoms with a δ- are then attracted to atoms with δ+ and an electrostatic interaction is formed. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p20.29">Hence this causes the polarisation of covalent bonds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.29">
<s n="s1.6;p21.29">Lastly hydrophobic interceptions play a very important role in the formation of the tertiary structure of a protein. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p21.29">Non-polar groups are repelled by water and attempt to fold the protein so they are on the interior and hence out of contact with any aqueous solvent. </s>

<s n="s5.6;p21.29">Charge polar residues such as Arg, His, Lys and Asp, Glu, are found on the surface of a protein as they are able to interact with the aqueous solvent. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p21.29">There are also uncharged polar groups like Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln, Tyr, Trp that can occur either on the inside or outside and can act as H-bond donors. </s>

<p n="p23.29">
<s n="s1.4;p23.29">It can be seen from the structure of Carbonic anhydrase that there is ample opportunity due to its intricate folding for many bonds to form between the polypeptide chain. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p23.29">Carbonic anhydrase demonstrates all of these types of bonding in its structure. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p23.29">This conformation is the most stable with the least repulsion between atoms. </s>

<s n="s1.16;p24.29">In a globular protein such as carbonic anhydrase, a human enzyme, many hydrogen bonds exist. </s>
<s n="s2.16;p24.29">Globular proteins are very important in biological systems and act as enzymes, hormones and transport and receptor proteins. </s>
<s n="s3.16;p24.29">Typically, as in carbonic anhydrase, they contain both -helices and β sheets in their secondary structures. </s>
<s n="s4.16;p24.29">These secondary structures are very stable as the bonds are at their optimum length and these structures are sterically favourable. </s>
<s n="s5.16;p24.29">Much of their tertiary structure is maintained by hydrogen bonds. </s>
<s n="s6.16;p24.29">However, as hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, this leads to the structure being less stable than of other molecules containing more covalent bonds such as diamond. </s>
<s n="s7.16;p24.29">In fact they are only 5-10% the strength of covalent bonds. </s>
<s n="s8.16;p24.29">This means that globular proteins are susceptible to high temperatures which disrupt their structure by breaking the hydrogen bonds and causing a loss of function. </s>
<s n="s9.16;p24.29">The ability of these hydrogen bonds to break can, however, be advantageous. </s>
<s n="s10.16;p24.29">For example, proteins can be easily broken down by the digestive system when they are damaged, in excess or no longer required and the amino acids can be reused in another protein. </s>
<s n="s11.16;p24.29">This recycling of sub-units is very important in the human body. </s>
<s n="s12.16;p24.29">The fact that the bonds are weaker also allows the bonds to flew and stretch when required. </s>
<s n="s13.16;p24.29">This is illustrated in haemoglobin or other transport proteins. </s>
<s n="s14.16;p24.29">The weak hydrogen bonds enable the shape of the molecules to change. </s>
<s n="s15.16;p24.29">When an oxygen molecule binds to a heme group on haemoglobin the structure is changed so that the other heme groups become more easily available for bonding. </s>
<s n="s16.16;p24.29">A third advantage is that the hydrogen bonds only require a small input of energy to form and so protein synthesis uses less energy. </s>
