<p n="p23.123">
<s n="s1.7;p23.123">Data Encryption Standard (DES) found in 1970's by IBM. It is the block cipher - an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another ciphertext bit string of the same length. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p24.123">The encryption system of DES uses the Feistel function. </s>

</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p84.123">
<s n="s1.3;p84.123">This form of XSS vulnerability has been referred to as Local cross-site scripting. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p84.123">With Local cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, the problem exists within a page's client-side script itself. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p84.123">For instance, if a piece of JavaScript accesses a URL request parameter and uses this information to write some HTML to its own page, and this information is not encoded using HTML entities, an XSS hole will likely be present, since this written data will be re-interpreted by browsers as HTML which could include additional client-side script. </s>
</p>
<p n="p85.123">
<s n="s1.2;p85.123">Because of the way Internet Explorer treats client-side script in objects located in the "local zone" (safe zone), an XSS hole of this kind in a local page can result in remote execution vulnerabilities. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p85.123">For example, if an attacker hosts a malicious website, which contains a link to a vulnerable page on a client's local system, a script could be injected and would run with privileges of that user's browser on their system. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p86.123">
<s n="s1.5;p86.123">This kind of cross-site scripting hole is also referred to as a non-persistent or reflected vulnerability, and is the most common type. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p86.123">These holes turn up when data provided by a web client is used immediately by server-side scripts to generate a page of results for that user. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p86.123">If invalid user supplied data is included in the resulting page without HTML encoding, this will allow client-side code to be injected into the dynamic page. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p86.123">A classic example of this is in site search engines: if one searches for a string which includes some HTML special characters, often the search string will be redisplayed on the result page to indicate what was searched for. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p86.123">If all occurrences of the search terms are not HTML entity encoded, an XSS hole will result. </s>
</p>
<p n="p87.123">
<s n="s1.3;p87.123">This does not appear to be a serious problem since users can only inject code into their own pages. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p87.123">However, with a small amount of social engineering, an attacker could convince a user to follow a malicious URL which injects code into the results page, giving the attacker full access to that page's content. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p88.123">
<s n="s1.3;p88.123">This type of XSS vulnerability is also referred to as a stored or persistent or second-order vulnerability and it allows the most powerful kinds of attacks. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p88.123">It exists when data provided to a web application by a user is first stored persistently on the server (in a database, file system, or other location), and later displayed to users in a web page without being encoded. </s>
