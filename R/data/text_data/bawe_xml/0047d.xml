<s n="s2.8;p43.48">During this time he continued on IVI heparin for several days, until being transferred to oral warfarin. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p43.48">No immediate surgical intervention was necessary and there were no signs to indicate that his foot had suffered any irreversible damage as a result of the ischaemia. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p43.48">Mr <name type="other"/> reported that he had not suffered from any pain or paraesthesiae since the heparin was started and his OBS had been stable through his admission. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p43.48">After being transferred to warfarin his INR, APTT and PT levels were closely monitored until appropriate levels for discharge had been achieved. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p43.48">Prior to discharge levels of INR = 2.0, PT = 21 and APTTR = 1.2 were achieved indicating a stable anti-coagulated state. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p43.48">Although there is still some debate as to whether long-term anticoagulation is beneficial in these patients, it would be important to keep Mr <name type="other"/> on warfarin in the short-term, at least until he can be reviewed in clinic. </s>

<head>Evidence based care and issues for research</head>
<p n="p44.48">
<s n="s1.5;p44.48">A recent Cochrane review compared the use of surgery with thrombolysis to determine the best initial management for acute limb ischaemia. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p44.48">It found that there was not enough evidence to support initial thrombolysis rather than initial surgery. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p44.48">It did however highlight the fact that thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of continued limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications (i.e. stroke), but then this risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in individuals. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p44.48">In addition, there was no overall difference in the rates of limb salvage or death at one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p44.48">The report therefore concluded that universal guidelines for initial treatment with either surgery or thrombolysis cannot be advocated based on the available evidence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.48">
<s n="s1.3;p45.48">Following successful reperfusion, there is still some debate regarding whether long-term anticoagulation is beneficial in patients such as <name type="other"/> who are not suffering from AF. For example Campbell et al (2000) suggest that long-term oral anticoagulation is associated with reduced risk of recurrent limb ischaemia and amputation, however they admit that more research is needed to define the specific benefits and risks. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p45.48">In contrast, a further report suggested that patients without AF or a cardiac thrombus may not be at the same risk for recurrent events as those with these risk factors, and that therefore long-term anticoagulant therapy may not be as necessary in this group (Forbes et al, 2003). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p45.48">It therefore appears that the choice to use of long-term anticoagulants remains at discretion of treating physician. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p46.48">The prevalence of acute leg ischaemia is approximately 1 in 12,000 patients per year (Tidy, 2004). </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.48">
<s n="s1.6;p47.48">In England and Wales approximately 5000 patients present each year, and the associated mortality is at least 20%, with a limb loss rate of 40%. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p47.48">Mortality is generally higher in patients presenting with embolic causes, while limb loss is higher in those with thrombosis. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p47.48">The majority of acute limb ischaemia is caused by acute thrombosis in a vessel with pre-existing atherosclerosis (60%) whilst embolism accounts for a further 30% of acutely ischaemic limbs. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p47.48">Most emboli (80%) have a cardiac cause and arise from the left atrium in patients with atrial fibrillation or following acute myocardial infarction. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p47.48">Less common cardiac sources include prosthetic valves, valve vegetations in endocarditis, "paradoxical" embolus and atrial myxoma. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p47.48">Arterial aneurysms account for a further 10% of emboli and may be in the aortic, iliac, femoral, popliteal, or subclavian arteries (Hickey et al, 1990). </s>

<s n="s1.4;p48.48">This case has provided to the opportunity to review the typical presentation and treatment of an acutely ischaemic limb. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p48.48">It has also highlighted the severity of the situation and the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid the need for amputation. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p48.48">Speed is essential as complete acute limb ischaemia will lead to irreversible tissue damage within 6 hours unless the limb is revascularised, therefore it is also important that senior help is called for early on as this may lead to improved limb salvage and survival. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p48.48">It allowed the various types of surgical intervention, such embolectomy, to be studied. </s>
