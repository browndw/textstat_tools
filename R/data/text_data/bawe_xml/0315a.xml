<s n="s1.6;p1.14">These scenarios raise some contentious issues regarding the availability and utility of judicial review. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p1.14">The central concepts in all three cases are the <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> test for reasonableness and natural justice, most notably the issues of bias and procedural fairness. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.14">Broadly speaking, a claim for judicial review can be founded on illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety, as expounded in the <hi rend="italic">GCHQ</hi> case. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.14">These principles are not mutually exclusive and the reasonableness umbrella further incorporates an assessment of whether all relevant considerations were taken into account and irrelevant factors were excluded. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.14">Judicial review has grown beyond <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> to incorporate the pursuit of improper purposes, which will prove instrumental to the claim of student Z. Student X's claim that the policy is irrational clearly demonstrates the problems of such rules that "bypass the legislature and foreclose the possibility of parliamentary scrutiny"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.14">It is clear in this case that the panel possess a wide discretionary power, which opens the door to the possibility of them acting <hi rend="italic">ultra vires</hi>. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p2.14">It will be interesting to consider how the <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> test and the rules of procedural fairness stand up faced with such challenges. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.14">Many commentators contend that <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> is becoming obsolete and since "the rules of natural justice are not engraved on tablets of stone"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.002"/>, it may be possible for the students to invoke emerging concepts such as fairness or proportionality. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.14">Nonetheless, the reviewing court has only a "supervisory jurisdiction"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.003"/> and may not review the merits of each case<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.14">It is imperative that the court affords the panel the margin of appreciation it deserves. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.14">If not, the reviewing court risks undermining the legitimacy of the disciplinary process. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p3.14">Under the ECHR<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.006"/>, they all pass the narrower "victim"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.007"/> test, which will be necessary if any of them choose to frame their case in terms of fundamental rights. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p4.14">X can bring a case on the basis of the panel's failure to consider the medical report, under the broad ground of procedural fairness and error of fact. </s>

<s n="s4.12;p4.14">The concept of natural justice can be problematic, but Craig helpfully defines it as "a manifestation of fairness"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p4.14">Fairness requires the court "to engage in a difficult balancing operation"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.011"/> of the individual interest at stake, the benefits from the additional procedural safeguard and the administrative costs of this. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p4.14">Here, there is visible evidence of failure to consider a very relevant report, which results in a denial of justice via this error of fact. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p4.14">The medical evidence has the potential to discredit the second positive test. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p4.14">One can surmise that the cost will be reasonable, especially since X has provided the report himself. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p4.14">The panel may argue that the court is interfering in their discretion but it is important to remember that the "discretion of a statutory body is never unfettered"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p4.14">This concept of fairness may include requirements beyond the traditional ambit of natural justice, for example a duty to act on evidence<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.013"/>, such as a medical report. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p4.14">The court must allow for a degree of deference regarding the expertise of the decision-maker. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p4.14">However, in <hi rend="italic">Tesco</hi>, it was held that the court should decide what constitutes a relevant consideration, leaving the decision-maker to attribute to it "such weight as he thinks fit"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.014"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.9;p5.14">The test in <hi rend="italic">Wednesbury</hi> is that a decision is "so unreasonable that no other reasonable decision-maker could have reached it"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.015"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p5.14">This is clearly "an onerous standard of review"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.016"/>, but Wade suggests that in practice, courts "lower the threshold to fit their more exacting ideas of administrative good behaviour"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.017"/>. </s>

<s n="s5.9;p5.14">A commonly cited example is banning red-headed teachers, which unfortunately for X, is a far cry from his complaint relating to his own wrongful act. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p5.14">The general rule that drugs are banned cannot viably be challenged and the existence of such a rule actually means that "like cases are more likely to be treated alike"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.018"/>. </s>

<s n="s4.9;p13.14">However, the court does not have the power to dictate the weight that should be given to the report. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p13.14">However, the line of argument based on the validity of the policy is considerably weaker.<hi rend="italic"> Wednesbury</hi> is a high standard to reach and it is highly unlikely that a court will sympathise with X's argument. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p13.14">Proportionality would potentially provide a better recourse, although it is not yet the universal test for <hi rend="italic">ultra vires</hi> actions. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p13.14">Y has a strong case to have her case reheard by a new panel, excluding the anti-drugs campaigner. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p13.14">Z's case should be successful on the grounds of the panel irrelevantly considering his poor grades. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p13.14">The line of argument based on an improper purpose is reasonably watertight, but is liable to fail if the court considers that the closure of the department is merely an incidental consequence of Z's serious cocaine offence. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.14">
<s n="s1.4;p14.14">Nevertheless, all three cases illustrate the importance of natural justice playing a significant role within the judicial review system. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p14.14">Cases such as these are important so that the system maintains its integrity and the confidence of the public. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p14.14">There have been fears of degeneration into a "nightmarish and dehumanising"<ref target="BAWE_0315a-ftnote.044"/> situation where the state becomes omnipotent. </s>
