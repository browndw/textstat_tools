<s n="s1.3;p1.20">Unlike the Augustinian poets of the eighteenth century, who strove to provide a generalized picture of experience and emotion, and to bring out what an experience had in common with all other such experiences, the Romantic movement in the nineteenth-century placed an emphasis on confronting 'each reader individually, with a representation of the poet's individuality." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s2.3;p1.20">At a time when 'mathematical thinking was the dominant intellectual mode' due to the influence of Isaac Newton's scientific findings, both William Wordsworth and William Blake strove to reach a more natural and humanistic state in their poetry, and to focus 'particularly on those aspects... which transcended or escaped the ordered patternings of mathematical form." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s3.3;p1.20">During the nineteenth-century the state of childhood was linked to the 'tender infantile sentiment appropriate to that perennial image of meekness;' therefore in order to get back to what the poets considered to be a 'truer state of humanity' and closer to a child-like state it is natural that the Romantic Poets should hold up the image of youth as an ideal condition, in order to connect more deeply with their reading public.<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.003"/> </s>

<s n="s1.3;p2.20">The representation of childhood in the texts I am looking at is one of purity and goodness. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.20">The child is portrayed as a helpless victim in the face of the social ills which befall him or her, leading to great pain and suffering, and therefore the child is deserving of our pity and compassion. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.20">This has the effect of adding emotional depth to the works which otherwise may seem very simple in composition and style. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.20">
<s n="s1.6;p3.20">Romantic writers were greatly influenced by the changing political states during the eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.20">The French Revolution had a huge effect in stirring up revolutionary feeling and the opposing fear of revolution in England and, by enlarging horizons in politics and society, 'must have had an equally great effect in enlarging cultural- including poetic- horizons." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.004"/>
<s n="s3.6;p3.20">This allowed writers to look closely at the more unpleasant elements in society that otherwise might have been glossed-over. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.20">However, an even greater effect was felt from the Industrial Revolution which had been taking place since 1770. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.20">Wordsworth saw the effect of the Industrial Revolution as the weakening of the 'bonds of domestic feeling among the poor,' due to the increase in mechanisation and the division of labour, both leading to a more socially and geographically mobile work force.<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.005"/> This had resulted in a great increase in the marginalized and the dispossessed in society, particularly in the rapidly growing cities, and it was these elements in society that became the main focus of both Wordsworth and Coleridge's 'Lyrical Ballads' and Blake's 'Songs of Innocence and Experience.' </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.20">However neither of the works are an explicit political analysis, and neither offer any form of alternative to the state of affairs at the time; instead the emphasis is on the emotional reactions created by social injustice. </s>

</p>
</note>
<p n="p4.20">
<s n="s1.6;p4.20">Wordsworth and Blake can be said to have differing religious and social ideologies; Henry Crabb Robinson draws attention to 'the reproaches [Blake] continually cast on [Wordsworth's] worship of nature, which, in the mind of Blake, constituted Atheism." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.006"/>
<s n="s2.6;p4.20">Indeed, Blake went so far as to state 'whoever believes in Nature disbelieves in God." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s3.6;p4.20">This goes directly against Wordsworth's belief, influenced greatly by the pantheism of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, that 'truth to nature was the vital precondition for the exercise of poetic imagination." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.008"/>
<s n="s4.6;p4.20">Wordsworth was 'devoted... to the more substantial spheres of natural beauty and personal feeling' in nature, rather than the worldliness of politics and materialism.<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.009"/> Therefore, whilst the emphasis in 'The Lyrical Ballads' is on the perfection of the natural world, and more importantly, how transcendence may be achieved through contact with the natural world, in Blake's 'Songs of Innocence' and 'Songs of Experience ' the emphasis is much less on nature and more on human emotion, and specifically on the purity of youth. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.20">Despite this difference, the words of Samuel Taylor Coleridge go some way towards bridging the gap between the two poets, as he states that 'innocence and the very truth of Nature must go together." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s6.6;p4.20">Therefore many common themes are seen in both poetical works. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.20">In both Wordsworth and Blake's poetry emotion is used to great effect. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.20">Instead of simply telling the reader about human suffering and emotion, they are asking you to feel it. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.20">In Blake's 'The Chimney Sweeper,' ('Songs of Innocence') the poet 'makes the reader feel what the child does not." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.011"/>
<s n="s4.5;p5.20">Therefore whilst Tom may be 'happy and warm' in the knowledge that 'if all do their duty, they need not feel harm,' we as readers are able to see the injustice in a society where a child is forced to state: 'so your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.012"/> This use of pathos has the effect, although not criticising the state of innocence, of making the reader aware of its limitations. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.20">Similarly, In Wordsworth's 'We are Seven,' the 'simple child' who may 'feel its life in every limb' is apparently incapable of facing the harsh reality and inflexibility of death.<ref target="BAWE_3080e-ftnote.013"/> Whilst innocence is a state to be envied, it can be short-sighted in its vision and therefore is likely to be abused. </s>
