<p n="p11.32">
<s n="s1.4;p11.32">Clinical signs such as pyrexia, dyspnoea and lung crackles were revealed during the physical examination which supports the diagnosis of a LRTI. A raised WCC and consolidation were also observed on the FBC and CXR respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.32">A CURB score of 2 indicated a severe pneumonia (urea>8mmol/l, RR>30/min). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.32">The presence of tachycardia, tremor and significantly reduced oxygen saturation suggest that inadequate gas exchange is occurring as a result. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p11.32">This is reflected in the ABG results which show a type 1 pattern of respiratory failure (PO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> &lt; 8kPa with normal pCO <hi rend="sub">2</hi>). </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.32">
<s n="s1.5;p12.32">The ABG suggest <name type="other"/> is suffering from acute respiratory acidaemia due to increased CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> retention. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.32">This would subsequently give rise to the noted tremor. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.32">As his condition has only deteriorated acutely no rise in CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> level has yet been observed, due to a compensatory use of the available HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.32">HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> has therefore fallen below the normal range. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.32">If inadequate ventilation were sustained, CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> levels would eventually rise, as would HCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> levels as a compensatory metabolic alkalosis developed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.32">
<s n="s1.6;p13.32">As Mr <name type="other"/> has no history of diabetes, the hyperglycaemia is probably a normal metabolic response to the severe demands currently placed upon his body. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.32">For example both infection and respiratory failure would promote secretion of glucagon, cortisol and catecholamines. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p29.32">Severe CAP is a life-threatening condition defined by the presence of respiratory failure or symptoms of severe sepsis or septic shock. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p29.32">It accounts for approximately 10% of hospitalized patients with CAP. The majority of patients with severe pneumonia have underlying co-morbid illnesses, with COPD, alcoholism, chronic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus being the most frequent. </s>

<hi rend="italic">S. pneumoniae, Legionella spp, H. influenzae, S. aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae</hi>, respiratory viruses (especially influenza viruses), and <hi rend="italic">P. aeruginosa</hi> represent the most important causative organisms of severe CAP. Rapid initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment is crucial for a favourable outcome. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p29.32">Initial antimicrobial treatment should be based on an empirical approach. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p29.32">Microbial investigation may be helpful in the individual case but is probably more useful to define local antimicrobial policies based on local epidemiologic and susceptibility patterns. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p29.32">Mortality rates range from 21% to 54%. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p29.32">The most important prognostic factors include general health state of the patient, appropriateness of initial antimicrobial treatment and the existence of bacteraemia, as well as factors reflecting severe respiratory failure, severe sepsis, septic hypotension or shock, and the extent of infiltrates in chest radiograph. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p29.32">Initial antimicrobial treatment should consist of a second (or third) generation cephalosporin and erythromycin. </s>

<p n="p30.32">
<s n="s1.1;p30.32">It is possible to manage the majority of episodes of acute respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation administered with non-invasive techniques, however the use of endotracheal intubation usually results in a poor prognosis i.e. one year survival rate is usually lower than 40% (Braghiroli, 1997). </s>
