<s n="s1.9;p1.10">This essay argues on the ambiguity of the realist critique towards liberal internationalism. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p1.10">The working definition of liberal internationalism used here is more inclusive, referring to the so-called "utopians" virulently criticized by E.H. Carr. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p1.10">The paper attempts to reveal that the core liberal assumption according to which ideas and morality matter in building an international society, has not been 'demolished' but rather capriciously 'borrowed' by realist thinkers like Carr. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p1.10">The arguments of this paper follow the core liberal creed that ideas and moral visions can influence politics. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p1.10">Moreover, the idea of harmony of interests has not been assumed by all idealists and deserves a more careful examination since it may not necessarily conceal vested interests. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p1.10">The paper concludes that the subtle fact of realists 'borrowing' core liberal assumptions renders their critique a rather ambiguous than a sound one. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p1.10">Carr mentioning of the need for utopia makes us think about the inevitability of consensus. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p1.10">Realism offers a simplistic account of how international relations <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be shaped, which in the end is faced with the need of leaving room for normative thinking. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p1.10">Ideas do matter even for realists and eventually the 'planes' will meet. </s>

<s n="s1.14;p2.10">Do states have common interests? </s>
<s n="s2.14;p2.10">To what extent can states have moral visions about how world politics should look like? </s>
<s n="s3.14;p2.10">Is cooperation possible? </s>
<s n="s4.14;p2.10">Is there any possibility to abolish war? </s>
<s n="s5.14;p2.10">These are the underlying questions, which have shaped the First Debate of International Relations, a debate between realism and liberalism, which is generally said to have been won by the realist team. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p2.10">However, many of today's liberal ideas and practices in world politics<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.001"/> have origins in the first writings of liberal internationalists such as the Enlightenment philosophy of Immanuel Kant with its ideal of creating a democratic and thus peaceful world order. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p2.10">While liberals like Adam Smith or Richard Cobden were supporters of the belief that free trade and <hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi> lead to global welfare and hence to peace, Kant considers that peace need more than commerce. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p2.10">Republican constitutions and pacific federation of states are the key elements for a 'perpetual peace'. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p2.10">Furthermore, the demise of communism in 1989 has strengthened liberal internationalism as an influential theoretical tradition. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p2.10">That moment is said to confirm the concept of history as linear, progressive and perfectible, and prove a general preference for democracy, free trade and collective security. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p2.10">Fukuyama's celebration of the 'end of history' regarded liberal democracy as an ideology without competitors and as a promise for the growing core of pacific states.<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.002"/> The language of free trade, comparative advantage theory, and efficiency seems to have triumphed. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p2.10">Clear indicators of the growing influence of liberal internationalism in world politics exist: briefly, we witness a proliferation of free trade agreements worldwide and an increasing weight of international multilateral political organizations. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p2.10">Consequently, liberal internationalism "deserves serious investigation and intellectual engagement".<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.003"/> The present paper will argue on the ambiguity of the realist critique of liberal internationalism, pointing out to the ceaseless relevance of liberal ideas. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p2.10">It attempts to reveal that the core liberal assumption according to which ideas and morality matter in building an international society (with its implications for democratic cooperation and harmony of interests) has not been 'demolished' but rather capriciously 'borrowed' by realist thinkers like Carr. </s>

<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The paper will use the phrase world politics instead of international relations because the former is more inclusive and refers not only to the relations between nations (inter-national) but also to relations that transcend the nation (transnational). </s>

<s n="s1.14;p3.10">Throughout history, important normative ideals and ideas have always inspired future improvements and projects in world politics. </s>
<s n="s2.14;p3.10">Philosophers and thinkers elaborated doctrines, laws or theories sometimes centuries before their implementation, creating trends of ideas and influencing political decision-makers and important events in world history. </s>
<s n="s3.14;p3.10">Think of Hugo Grotius, for instance, whose ideas were debated at the Council of Westphalia or of Hans Kelsen, whose drafts for a new League of Nations circulated long before the creation of the UN. Humans and institutions could always strive for improvement and perfection. </s>
<s n="s4.14;p3.10">Still, feasibility requires commitment, perseverance and most of all willingness. </s>
<s n="s5.14;p3.10">On the one hand, liberal internationalists (idealists) believe that war is a tool for autocratic and unrepresentative leaders, and a reflection of the pernicious ideology of balance of power. </s>
<s n="s6.14;p3.10">Education in the spirit of democracy and the belief in the perfectibility of human nature can avoid and eventually eliminate the likelihood of conflicts. </s>
<s n="s7.14;p3.10">The prospects for international cooperation are genuine if we believe in the possibility of institutions and international law to promote and preserve it. </s>
<s n="s8.14;p3.10">There is no reasonable desire to wage wars since the costs are higher than the benefits. </s>
<s n="s9.14;p3.10">Having this belief in mind, during the 1920s the liberal architects have envisaged the League of Nations and the Briand-Kellogg Pact, trying to dismiss war as a justified instrument of foreign policy and to promote and maintain peace among nations. </s>
<s n="s10.14;p3.10">On the other hand, realists believed that conflicts are endemic because they reflect a fixed human nature characterized by constant desire for power. </s>
<s n="s11.14;p3.10">Even the ancient Gyges' myth told by sophists reveals that men would always commit wrongdoing and immoral acts if there were no prospects for punishment. </s>
<s n="s12.14;p3.10">We would all use a ring that can make us invisible in order to steal, cheat or kill.<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.004"/> Starting with Thucydides, Thomas Hobbes, Nicollo Machiavelli, realism has upheld the idea that what characterizes relations among people as well as among sovereign states is an eternal struggle for power and a selfish competition for glory and material gains in a world of scarce resources. </s>
<s n="s13.14;p3.10">Anarchy (lack of central government) is what characterizes international politics and it can only be managed by balancing the power between states. </s>
<s n="s14.14;p3.10">Hence, Carr's critique towards utopians' wishful thinking mentioned the danger of using preferences and desires in shaping international politics. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p4.10">Competition instead of cooperation and selfishness instead of altruism stand as the realist convictions. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p4.10">From a realist perspective, the necessity of pursuing national self-interest can sometimes ask for immoral and violent conduct which is excused in a Machiavellian manner. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p4.10">However, there may be a strong temptation for humans to act selfishly, as well as for states to cheat but there may also be second thoughts and eventually decisions for altruism and cooperation because states as well as people cannot live in the isolation of self-interest. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p4.10">It is not utopian to say that human beings are perfectible and that education is essential in cultivating morality and unselfish behavior. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p4.10">But educating people in the idea that pursuing self-interest is essential because we live in a selfish world, is in itself a "normative" act, which unfortunately can have negative outcomes and hence realism can confirm itself. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p4.10">Since it is wise to just accept ineluctable forces, isn't it frustrating to call yourself a realist? </s>
<s n="s8.10;p4.10">Is there any chance for peoples to induce any change in the system if we accept this deterministic and fatalist view? </s>
<s n="s9.10;p4.10">Booth strikingly evidenced that Hiroshima 1945 is a good enough reason to reject a traditional worldview that promotes selfishness and war as necessities.<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.006"/> Booth prefers to advocate for a 'utopian realism', since a boat should not only survive the austere waters but also reach a destination. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p5.10">Carr speaks about complete realists and complete utopians, admitting the sterility of a complete realist outlook but without offering a concrete alternative to the so-called utopians. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p5.10">Consequently, "It is rather curious that Carr remains celebrated for his staunch realist critique of idealism".<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.008"/> One can say that the degeneration of realism started with Carr. </s>

<s n="s6.8;p5.10">The authors came to the conclusion that the diluted core assumptions of realism (especially contemporary realism) renders it an incoherent theory. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p5.10">One can say that the ambiguity of the realist stance has somehow been consolidated by the later development of neo-liberal institutionalism (the reason for the subsequent "neo-neo" consensus (or maybe compromise) between neo-realism and neo-liberal institutionalism). </s>
<s n="s8.8;p5.10">As Keohane would say, ideas have always shaped agenda and hence outcomes.<ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.010"/> In this respect, he offers the example of China where Soviet ideas and not Soviet power has influenced economic policies or the event of de-colonization, which did not reflect a lack of power but rather a will and desire for change. </s>

<s n="s2.7;p6.10">For Carr, <hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi> is actually a Machiavellian device invented by the privileged classes to defend and maintain their interests and domination. </s>

<s n="s6.15;p9.10">But that is why democracy establishes checks and balances, accepts changes and progress while the interdependence of our world makes it much more difficult for some states to dominate the world. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p9.10">Moreover, the lack of commitment to collective security, i.e. the stubbornness of some states in refusing to improve relations among states within a global regulatory framework, can also be responsible for the League's failure. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p9.10">Or, as Angell argues "The danger of expecting too much of a mere "piece of machinery" the installation of which was not accompanied by a reformed perception of international problems." </s>

<s n="s9.15;p9.10">Moreover, until 1914, the "balance of power" principle, which viewed the world system as a self-regulatory system, also failed to prevent the First World War. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p9.10">Of course, realism has never claimed that it is possible to overcome war as an inherent feature of international relations. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p9.10">But unfortunate events in world politics should not result in merely a rejection of the possibility for democratic cooperation among states. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p9.10">On the contrary, these events should give us material for reflection on how world politics should be made more democratic. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p9.10">Realism offers a much more static perspective on the capacity of states to change their interests and to care less about power in selfish terms of relative gains and more about cooperation and absolute gains. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p9.10">States seem like torpid bodies incapable of inducing any fundamental alteration of the system (except another balance of power) which may actually be beneficial for them as well as for other states. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p9.10">This can be explained through the limited definition given by Morgenthau to international politics, as a "continuing effort to maintain or increase the power of one's nation and to keep in check or reduce the power of other nations." <ref target="BAWE_0195b-ftnote.016"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p10.10">In conclusion, the idealist tendencies found in Carr's writings are a proof for the limits of realism as a static and simplistic bias on the ways international relations <hi rend="italic">ought to</hi> <hi rend="italic">be</hi> shaped. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.10">Carr mentioning of the need for utopia makes us think about the inevitability of consensus. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.10">Not only that realism displays normative thinking (the claim of objectivity can be easily rejected because realism makes enough value-judgements about human nature that cannot possibly be neutral), but it is also confronted with the inevitable exigency of finding a way out from the deadlock by adopting an idealist stance. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.10">There are no winners of the First Debate in International Relations. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.10">Contrary to Carr's prediction, the plane of realism will always meet the plane of liberals and the debate should always remain open. </s>
