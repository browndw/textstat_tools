<p>The British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC. Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s1.7;p1.17">This report analyses the motion of the car as it passes over a pothole on the road. </s>

<s n="s3.7;p1.17">Road irregularities are the main factor affecting ride quality. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p1.17">Suspension elements between the road wheels and the automobile body generate vertical forces, which incite both heave and pitch motions. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p1.17">The modelling and simulation of this dynamical engineering system is done and is given in this report. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p1.17">Using this simulation, the model's behaviour is studied extensively. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p5.17">The mechanical system to be modelled is a car suspension system. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.17">A car incorporating this suspension system will travel along a flat and horizontal road surface (assumed) until it arrives at a pothole in the road. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.17">During the journey over the flat horizontal surface, the pitch (angular motion) and the heave (vertical motion) of the vehicle are unaffected. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.17">To correctly simulate a system it is essential to develop a mathematical model. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.17">The mathematical model consists of an accurate set of equations that best describe the behaviour of the mechanical system, which can then be used to simulate the system. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.17">As the configuration for both the front and rear suspensions is identical it is best to derive the mathematical model of one axel and then replicate it to represent the second axel. </s>
