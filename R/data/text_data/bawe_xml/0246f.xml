<p n="p42.49">
<s n="s1.4;p42.49">Bullous Pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic, acquired autoimmune subepidermal bullous disease in which autoantibodies are directed against components of the basement membrane zone of the skin, causing blistering of the skin. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p42.49">BP is characterised by the presence of IgG autoantibodies specific to hemidesmosomal BP antigens. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p42.49">BP is the most common blistering disease in the West, with an estimated incidence of 6-7 cases per million population per year (1). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p42.49">BP occurs equally in both sexes and it is usually a disease of the elderly (>70 years). </s>
</p>
<p n="p43.49">
<s n="s1.4;p43.49">BP is a non-scarring blistering disease, with a typical presentation in the flexure regions, however the disease can be generalised. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p43.49">Mucous membranes are involved in about 50% of patients (2). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p43.49">Tense blisters occur on either erythematous or normal appearing skin and the blister formation may be preceded by an urticarial or eczematous rash. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.49">The degree of itch in each individual varies from none to intense and it can precede the presentation of blisters by weeks, months and occasionally years. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.49">
<s n="s1.4;p44.49">Diagnosis of BP is made clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically (using either direct and/or indirect immunofluorescence). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p44.49">Biopsies of a fresh blister show a subepidermal cleft with a mixed dermal inflammatory infiltrate containing numerous Eosinophils. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p44.49">IgG and/or C3 deposits are found at the basement membrane zone. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p44.49">The class of immunoglobulin bound to the basement membrane zone distinguishes from Linear IgA disease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p45.49">
<s n="s1.4;p45.49">The treatment aim in BP is to suppress the clinical signs sufficiently to make the disease tolerable to an individual patient, i.e. the reduction of blister formation, urticarial lesions and pruritus. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p45.49">The disease is self-limiting and usually remits within 5 years, the mortality rates today vary between 6% and 41% (3). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p45.49">The treatment primarily aims to reduce the inflammatory process, i.e. with the use of corticosteroids and antibiotics. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p45.49">Immunosuppressive agents aim to suppress the production of the pathogenic antibodies. </s>
</p>
<p n="p46.49">
<s n="s1.2;p46.49">BP is a long-term disease and ideally all patients should be followed until they are in complete remission and off all treatment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p46.49">They should be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are not being continued on higher doses of topical or systemic treatment than are necessary to provide sufficient control of their disease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p47.49">
<s n="s1.3;p47.49">There is no established optimum treatment for BP and therefore there is no gold standard against which to audit clinical practice. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p47.49">In an age when our population are living longer, it is inevitable that BP will become increasingly more frequent. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p47.49">There is a clear need to determine how to assess patients clinically and how to ascertain optimum regimes for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe BP. </s>
