<s n="s1.2;p1.46">Simple Life Ltd, founded in 2005 By <name type="other"/> requires £75,000 for the development and initial manufacturing of a tool to aid in the turning of everyday object in the household for sufferers of arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome and claw hand. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p1.46">This initial investment will be in return for a 20% stake in the company. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p2.46">
<s n="s1.2;p2.46">The Arthritis Research Campaign state that 4.4 million people in the UK have X-ray evidence of moderate to severe arthritis in their hands [1]. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.46">This can be seen as Simple Life's potential market. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p3.46">
<s n="s1.2;p3.46">A niche product has been designed that is better quality and more aesthetically pleasing than its rivals. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.46">Furthermore, unlike the products currently available, the Simple Life tool is universal. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p4.46">
<s n="s1.1;p4.46">By retailing not only through the internet, but through mail order and high street outlets we aim to quickly gain a firm place in the market. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p5.46">
<s n="s1.1;p5.46">Current assets stand at £57,000 gathered from family and personal savings. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p6.46">In three years we aim to be manufacturing 26000 products a year, and have a closing profit of over £89,000. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.46">
<s n="s1.1;p7.46">In ten years, if the current trends continue and Simple life gains just 10% of the market from its main competitor Homecraft Roylan, you will have a five-fold return on your investment . </s>

<p n="p8.46">
<s n="s1.4;p8.46">A device to aid in three different household operations that prove particularly difficult for sufferers of common hand ailments such as arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome and claw hand. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.46">The three different operations are covered by three separate tools. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.46">These are interchangeable about a central handle that is ergonomically designed for comfort and ease of use. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.46">This handle can be seen below. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p9.46">The three tools are as follows: </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.46">
<s n="s1.1;p10.46">Jar opener - This allows varying sizes of lids to be removed with ease. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.46">
<s n="s1.1;p11.46">Key turner - Provides more leverage for a standard door/window key. </s>

<p n="p13.46">
<s n="s1.4;p13.46">This is the most important aspect in our business. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.46">We view quality as an order winning feature in this market, as current manufacturers have failed to implement this level of high quality. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.46">As a commitment to our customers and a demonstration of confidence in our product, we want to assure long term functionality and hence will offer a 3 year guarantee on all of our products. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.46">This will make our brand image that of a producer of high quality goods. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Packaging</head>
<p n="p14.46">
<s n="s1.3;p14.46">Again we feel that this is where our competitors fall down, allowing an exploitable gap in the market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p14.46">Competitor's products are sold in a clear plastic wrapper with a named sticky label attached. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p14.46">We are packaging with professionalism in mind; with visually attractive covering and clear description of the product. </s>

<head rend="bold">Place</head>
<p n="p15.46">
<s n="s1.9;p15.46">Currently the majority of sales are through third party companies online. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p15.46">We do not believe that this is the optimum retail method for the Simple Life product. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p15.46">The majority of our target market is the age group 65+. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p15.46">Considering this fact, and the reviewing the chart below for 'Access to internet'. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p15.46">You can see that retailing through the internet may not be the best method, as only 4% of the UK internet usage is attributed to our majority target age group. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p15.46">This data is reflected in a report titled ' Home Shopping - UK- March 2005' from the Mintel economic database. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p15.46">It can be seen that 7% of over 65's have purchased goods from the internet in the past 12 months [3]. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p15.46">From the same report it is shown that 28% of the same age group have purchased from a mail order catalogue. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p15.46">Based on this data we believe that mail order catalogues will be a more suitable method of retail than the internet, which is used by our competitors, Homecraft Roylan. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p16.46">Suffering from arthritis does not impede the ability to stroll down the high street. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p16.46">We believe that despite the high possible sales through mail order catalogues, Customers always prefer purchasing a physical product. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p16.46">With our superior quality and eye catching design, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to the possible sales that could be achieved through this method of retail. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p16.46">Therefore we are planning to sell through mail order and direct retailing channels. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p17.46">Our product has spurred from the rival products (See Appendices a). </s>
<s n="s2.10;p17.46">These have a combined average cost of £20.27. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p17.46">As we are selling a focus differentiated product we believe that we can sell at a premium price. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p17.46">People will pay more for a universal device as it prevents clutter in the household. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p17.46">Also due to the product's aesthetics it will stand out in the marketplace. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p17.46">Hence a recommended retail price of £25.00 is suitable. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p17.46">As our competition has a strong hold on the market, we will offer a high profit of margin for the retailers. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p17.46">By setting the wholesale price to £12 we offer a profit to the retailer of £13. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p17.46">At a cost of £2.80 to manufacture each product we achieve a gross profit of £9.20 per product and gross profit margin of over 76%. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p17.46">By doing this we can ensure that retailers will find it attractive to sell the Simple Life product over the more established competitor who is offering less return on sales. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Promotion</head>
<p n="p18.46">
<s n="s1.3;p18.46">For high street sales, we believe that a demonstration video would dramatically increase sales and set our product apart from our competitors. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.46">From this, potential customers will clearly see the benefits of having this multipurpose tool and so the product will sell itself. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.46">Expanding to trade shows such as the "Nursing &amp; Elderly Care" whilst providing samples and additional information, can prove very successful in finding distributors for our products; this method can also reduce our overall costs if distributors agree upon sharing marketing and promotional costs. </s>

<head rend="bold">Location</head>
<p n="p34.46">
<s n="s1.2;p34.46">One of the other main factors affecting location is the ease of distribution, for example; by renting space next to main transport routes, delivery to the retailers is a lot easier. </s>

<s n="s5.10;p43.46">Simple Life anticipates producing 450 units in the first year, with sales reaching 400 units. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p43.46">Simple life can manufacture these units at £2.80 each. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p43.46">By selling them at a wholesale price of £12, revenue of £4800 will be generated. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p43.46">Overhead costs (incorporating factors such as salary, training, research and development, marketing and insurance) will be approximately £56,200. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p43.46">Therefore the predicted net loss/deficit in the first year would be £52,520. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p43.46">In a worst case scenario, where only 200 units are sold the net loss would be £58160. </s>

<s n="s1.8;p44.46">In the second year Simple Life forecasts sales of 7,000 units. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p44.46">It is anticipated that sales will peak in winter when the cold exacerbates mobility disabilities. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p44.46">The second fiscal year will prove extremely challenging as Simple Life has set a target of achieving profit by this year. </s>
