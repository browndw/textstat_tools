<s n="s1.4;p2.86">According to Milton (2005, p189), an ideal project team plays an important role in project success. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.86">A project team is composed of a group of individuals who coordinate together for the achievement of a common objective for a specific project. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.86">Increasingly, building and developing an efficient team is becoming the vital key to any success of project management. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.86">Therefore, the appropriate and critical evaluation of team work performance is accordingly important as it tells the project manager how efficient the project team is. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.86">
<s n="s1.5;p3.86">This report is an evaluation attempt which is based on a project team (6) work during the module exercise. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.86">The first chapter focuses on team roles review according to Belbin's team role theory. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.86">In the following section, the team lifecycle is analyzed by applying Turckman's team development model. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.86">The team decision making procedures are briefly discussed in the third part. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p3.86">The conflicts within the team and the team leadership are evaluated in the latter sections respectively. </s>

<head rend="italic">Teamwork performance</head>
<p n="p4.86">
<s n="s1.2;p4.86">Generally, team members play a different role but enjoy broadly equal status, and each of them has its own duties and responsibilities (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.86">The Belbin's psychometric test provides the disposition towards certain team roles and enables team members to develop clear expectations about the potential contribution of each team role (Belbin, 1993). </s>

<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">Team's Belbin profiles</head>
<p n="p5.86">
<s n="s1.2;p5.86">To identify each individual member's style and behavioral preference, Dr. Belbin has developed a system which enables team members to assess themselves and by others within the group in terms of team role preference. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.86">A clear awareness of one's team role preference helps set up good understanding among team members which makes the team well-balanced (Belbin, 1993). </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.86">
<s n="s1.3;p6.86">Based on the Belbin's team role self perception results, each member of team 6 has been allocated with its primary, secondary and tertiary roles. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.86">In this chapter, each role functions, its strength and weakness will be discussed. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.86">Shown below is the table of Belbin profile of team 6 members followed by the explanation of each of the roles. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p7.86">
<hi rend="bold">The implementer IM:</hi> Generally, implementers are mainly in the positions of responsibility in larger organizations regardless of their own attitude and interests (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p7.86">Venne seemed to have relatively stable approach to work and well-developed organizational ability. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p7.86">However, she was lack of real ideas and flexibility as she joined the team late. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p7.86">Along with project approaching, she was inclined to be a CO and contributed much to coordinating with other colleagues. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p7.86">Pratap did play a good role as an IM as he was open to different ways of thinking and working, practical, conservative, responsible and strived to achieve the goals. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p7.86">Whereas, the common weakness of them is that they are slightly obstructive to change, even when it is positive. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p8.86">
<s n="s1.7;p8.86">
<hi rend="bold">The plant PL:</hi> Creative, inventive and relatively quiet is regarded as Plants' distinctive characters (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.7;p8.86">In this aspect, Indira has contributed the best to the team development and project completion. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p8.86">Particularly, when facing difficulties and problems, she was regarded as an idea person as she sometimes came up with winning possibility. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p8.86">Indira seemed to be good at communicating and exchanging ideas with others. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p8.86">However, according to Belbin's research, plants are good at starting up projects but less contributive in consolidating success for an established firm (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s6.7;p8.86">This sign did occur in the late stage of project fulfillment. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p8.86">To maximize her contribution to the team, she should time her contributions during the discussions and strengthen her willingness to facilitate the team. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p9.86">
<s n="s1.5;p9.86">
<hi rend="bold">The resource investigator RI:</hi> The RI role is similar to the role of a PL but more extroverted and inquisitive. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.86">They are inclined to collect different ideas from others and develop them, and good at exploring resources outside the group (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.86">Indira did have sourced several ideas and basic disciplines from instructors and developed them to some extent. However, she intended to loose the initial enthusiasm quickly. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.86">Besides this she also seemed not to have enough ability to collect and summarize others idea and develop them. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.86">Therefore, to maximize her potential contribution to the team, she should not only focus on sourcing information from outside but also the internal side. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p10.86">
<s n="s1.9;p10.86">
<hi rend="bold">The coordinator CO:</hi> Nancy is inclined to be very extroversive, energetic and aggressive, especially when exploring feasible approach. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p10.86">Additionally, Coordinators should be skilled in organization and good at summarizing ideas from others, discover others' abilities and encourage them (Belbin, 1993). </s>
<s n="s3.9;p10.86">When conflicts came up, she was in the position of being an arguer rather than coordinating with others. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p10.86">Conversely, Sameer has some of the characters that the role of CO required. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p10.86">He possess acceptance, self-discipline that motivates other team members. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p10.86">He is calm, tolerant and unflappable at tough situations. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p10.86">However, his weakness to be a CO is that he appeared to be lack of enthusiasm and the persuasive argument .This might be unacceptable extreme during the team development process (Belbin, 1993). </s>
<s n="s8.9;p10.86">In practice, Sameer seemed to be a TW which is his secondary role rather than a team leader (CO), as he found it hard to lead the whole team. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p10.86">Therefore, on the whole, how individual member arrives at its given type of team-role behavior needs to be taken into account (Belbin, 1993). </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p11.86">
<s n="s1.10;p11.86">
<hi rend="bold">The shaper SH:</hi> Shapers are usually extroversive and energetic and aggressive. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p11.86">They are not hesitant to question and challenge others' opinions. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p11.86">Although Indira and Nancy did come up with many ideas and arguments, they sometimes agreed to others when they were convinced by persuasive evidence. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p11.86">This is one of the main reasons of achieving efficient decision making for the team and it largely shortened the time for team members to arrive in agreement. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p11.86">According to Belbin's research, shapers are likely to blame other team members. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p11.86">Practically, Indira, Nancy and Pratap appeared to be more tolerant than theoretical description. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p11.86">Pratap's shaper qualities benefited the team as a subsidiary role. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p11.86">He was in the best position to lead and balance the team when the team was slow-moving. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p11.86">Shapers need to both direct the team and coordinate team members' contribution without outmaneuvering them (Belbin, 1993). </s>
<s n="s10.10;p11.86">It seemed that all of them had a good performance of being Shapers, whereas, they should have more clearer targets and establish priorities to avoid misleading team. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p12.86">
<s n="s1.6;p12.86">
<hi rend="bold">The monitor evaluator ME:</hi> Monitor evaluator is a person who has high level mental ability and disinterested detachment particularly when facing the conflict among team members, which plays an important role in a project team (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p12.86">Indira seemed focus on generating new ideas more than critical reasoning and seldom judged the merits of any idea. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p12.86">Compared with plant and RI, ME is more critical, serious-minded, prudent and considerate (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.6;p12.86">Generally, the more complex the decision-making process is and the more conflict that arise within a team, the more important the role that ME play (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p12.86">As a ME, Indira should have the ability to clarify complicated issues, generate understandable ideas, identify the weaknesses in ideas and assess its practicability, and make constructive comment. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p12.86">However, the lack of monitoring function of a team may consequently lead to the unbalanced team profile and out of control when conflicts occur. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p13.86">
<s n="s1.6;p13.86">
<hi rend="bold">The team worker TW:</hi> They are known for averting friction and enabling team members to corporate smoothly as they have the skill of listening to others' opinion and coping with awkward colleagues (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p13.86">Both Sameer and Venne are sensitive, trusting and supportive. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p13.86">When meeting barriers and difficulties, they can stimulate the team's morale and heal relationship breakdowns. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.86">They contributed the most to building a harmonious environment. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.86">However, their indecision sometimes raised conflict and pressure. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p13.86">Nancy's team role function seemed to be relatively weak as a TW. She was more like CO and SH as discussed before. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p14.86">
<s n="s1.6;p14.86">
<hi rend="bold">The completer-finisher CF:</hi> Venne played this role as her primary option. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.86">Given that many managers are with much enthusiasm at the beginning of projects but are reluctant to complete what they start, the role of CF tend to be quite essential in a project team. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.86">Venne was inclined to be a perfectionist, as she seldom showed her opinion without critical thinking. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.86">She always kept an eye on the project approaching and spotted the mistakes timely. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.86">However, sometimes she appeared to be over critical and which resulted in the delay of decision making. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.86">As a CF, her main weakness is lack of the ability to finalize any undertaking within the group. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p15.86">
<s n="s1.5;p15.86">
<hi rend="bold">The specialist SP:</hi> They, the team members, played a behavioral role rather than functional role as they are new to this area and not professional or technical in any aspects. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p15.86">The lack of relative experiences and specialized skills led to the failure of project timing. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p15.86">At the latest stage of project, all the team members agreed to risking time to enhance the chance for saving money and making big profit. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p15.86">Unfortunately, they delayed for three days although they made a relatively higher profit. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p15.86">This result may due to the lack of specialist who can tell and provide evidence whether it is worthwhile to take the risk or not. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Impacts on team performance:</head>
<div4>
<p n="p16.86">
<s n="s1.3;p16.86">
<hi rend="bold">The impact of gender and age:</hi> Although age and gender have offered a way of assigning roles, team 6 has not applied this method to separate responsibilities. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.86">Instead, each member took its own roles based on its preference and their capability and confidence to do the role well. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.86">Not many conflicts occurred due to the difference of age and gender as the distribution of each factor was relatively even. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p17.86">
<s n="s1.2;p17.86">
<hi rend="bold">Culture:</hi> As all the team members are from different countries, the language barriers and culture background difference sometimes led to the delay of decision making and conflicts. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.86">In this situation, to correct this weakness, more time should be left for people getting to know each other and understanding the ways others approach the task, particularly during the team forming phrase. </s>
</p>
</div4>
<div4>
<p n="p18.86">
<s n="s1.3;p18.86">
<hi rend="bold">Language barrier:</hi> As English was not the first / native language of any of the team member, it did cause slight hindrances in the progress of the team goals. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.86">As mentioned above, the language and cultural differences did occasionally cause delay in decision making and some indifference among team members. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.86">As time progressed, the team members got to know each other well and the problems faced with language as a barrier got reduced with time. </s>

</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">Excess team roles evaluation</head>
<p n="p19.86">
<s n="s1.4;p19.86">As shown in the table above, the team had various members play the entire roles essential to make up a strong team. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.86">However, there were few roles that were concentrated with team members and others which hardly had any. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.86">The IM role was the most crowded, with 4 members, and this was a spot of bother at the beginning as there were too many comments on how to start the work. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.86">Apart from this the complete finisher role was also crowded, with 3 members, which cold have been one of the main reason of the delay in the outcome. </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.86">
<s n="s1.1;p20.86">The remaining roles which had 3 members (TW and SH) were well balanced as those respective roles demanded extra help and effort and it boosted the teams performance with those extra members. </s>
</p>
</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">Scarce team roles evaluation</head>
<p n="p21.86">
<s n="s1.5;p21.86">On the other hand there were few roles which had a scarcity of team members to carry out with it. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p21.86">As seen from the table, the PL, RI and ME roles were played by Indira. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p21.86">The lack of members was especially felt for the RI role as it is quite a labour intensive role. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p21.86">But Indira definitely deserves to be praised as she single handedly had to deal with the finding the right external resources, played the role as a Plant as well as monitored the entire project schedule. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p21.86">There were times when the team was let down due to scarcity of members for the above mentioned roles but in the end it did not affect the outcome by much. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.86">
<s n="s1.2;p22.86">Apart from these roles, the coordinator and the specialist role was well composed off and had the right amount of members to complete the task. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.86">Even though at times it was felt that a specialist role should have only one specialist as there could be a dispute among to of them as a very critical approach is require to carry out the task. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.86">
<s n="s1.7;p23.86">Belbin's (1993) work shows that a complete team should have all the team roles represented. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p23.86">The fact is that, the members are multidimensional. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p23.86">This means most people have the preferences for more than one role and can fulfill them within a team. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p23.86">According to Belbin, the behavioral styles' similarity within a team may arise conflicts. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p23.86">Therefore, the participation and complementation of each role are both needed to be recognized. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p23.86">To perform well, each of the balanced team members should identify others' strength and weakness based on their team role preferences. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p23.86">Moreover, respecting each other is another one of the key factors of building up a confident group. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">The team lifecycle</head>
<p n="p24.86">
<s n="s1.6;p24.86">Like a growing child, a growing team has different needs at different times (Zenger et al., 1990). </s>
<s n="s2.6;p24.86">They need to go through stages of development regardless of their functions and objectives. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p24.86">Particularly, newly formed teams need a period for adjustment and building up a harmonious working environment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p24.86">Generally, the team lifecycle comprises of four sequential phases. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p24.86">These stages include serial teambuilding evens and movements which enhance the team's maturity step by step. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p24.86">Groups need to experience all these stages before they achieve maximum effectiveness (Tuckman et al., 1977). </s>

<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">Forming: </head>
<p n="p25.86">
<s n="s1.9;p25.86">When team 6 members met each other for the project, there was a sense of anticipation and commitment. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p25.86">They had a high motivation, but their effectiveness was moderate as they are unsure of each other. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p25.86">Forming is the first stage which provides the opportunities for team members to get to know each other and define their common goals (Nicholls, 2005). </s>
<s n="s4.9;p25.86">After building up trust and confidence, the team roles were assigned to individuals. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p25.86">Accordingly, responsibilities were allocated to each member within team 6. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p25.86">During this stage, team 6 cultivated a sense of belonging and togetherness which largely encouraged team morale. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p25.86">However, they did not make clear work schedules at the earliest stage and which planted the potential of failure in project timing. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p25.86">At the beginning there would be a lot of misunderstanding and miscommunication among the team members. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p25.86">However, according to Belbin (1993), the profligate use of time may accelerate the prospects of success. </s>

</div3>
<div3>
<head rend="bold italic">Storming:</head>
<p n="p26.86">
<s n="s1.8;p26.86">After the first stage development, the team went through a phase of competition and conflict. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p26.86">During this stage, team members appeared to have less enthusiasm than the initial period, which led to frustration. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p26.86">Different opinions came up in this phase. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p26.86">Team members struggled to find ways to deal with the conflicts and realised that endless argument would have no positive effect on decision making. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p26.86">Although they can appreciate others' skills and experiences, this issue is difficult to be handled without ground rules and norms. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p26.86">The overlap of responsibilities and roles might be the main reason of conflicts. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p26.86">Therefore, a set of standards and methods needed to be deduced for handling conflicts and solving problems in the next stage. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p26.86">But it must be said that it was during this phase that the team members got to know each other better and there was a sense of trust being formed. </s>

<head rend="bold italic">Norming:</head>
<p n="p27.86">

<p n="p58.86">
