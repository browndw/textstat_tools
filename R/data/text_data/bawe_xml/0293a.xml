<s n="s1.6;p8.66">Although East Asia has relatively high intra-regional trade volume, the degree of institutionalization of economic cooperation is strikingly slight so far. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.66">Though the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has established in 1967, its principal aim was an alliance for anti-communism based on the fear of threat of communist power triggered by formidable regime change in Vietnam. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.66">In 1960s, many developing countries were pushing forward an economic integration beyond simple functional cooperation. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.66">Central American Common Market (CACM, signed in 1960), Latin American Integration Association (LAIA/LAFTA, signed in 1960), Andean Pact (AP, signed in 1969) are launched at this time. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.66">The only exception was East Asia. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.66">Since then, this institutional underdevelopment in economic cooperation has been explained from different theoretical perspectives. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.66">
<s n="s1.2;p9.66">Many scholars have attributed the incomplete institutionalization in this region to cultural and ideational factors. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.66">They paid attention to the Asian tradition that preferred trust and consensus-building rather than contract-based transaction and law-based problem-solving as means of cooperation and confrontation with neighbour countries. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p10.66">They saw Asian characteristics can be applied to the explanation of institutionalization in this region. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.66">According to North, 'informal constraints' are likely to produce cooperative behaviour as well as the existence of formal institution. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.66">He also paid attention to the importance of 'self-imposed codes of behaviour' as a factor affecting cooperation and conflict (North 1990, 42-43). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.66">In addition, neoliberal institutionalists claim that institution does not merely mean the formal organization as a physical entity; it also includes informal type of convention that affects actors' behavior without explicit rules (Keohane 1989, 3-4). </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.66">Thus, it could be interpreted that institutionalization in East Asia had already been implicitly implemented within the shared norms or the expectations of actors' behavior in this region. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.66">
<s n="s1.3;p11.66">In contrast to this, realists have identified the causes of the lag of cooperation in East Asia from the political conflict based on security instability in this region. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.66">The most prevalent explanation is that the opposition of the United States prevented East Asian countries from pursuing deeper intra-regional cooperation. </s>

<p n="p12.66">
<s n="s1.1;p12.66">James Baker, then U.S. Secretary of State recalled that he would do his best to 'kill' (EAEC ; East Asia Economic Caucas) because he did not envisage the East Asian Community without U.S. His mission, at this time, was to lessen the risk to the America's economic interest that the new emergent economic bloc might bring about in this region (quoted in Terada 2003, 259). </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.66">
<s n="s1.3;p13.66">The U.S. vigilance over East Asia, different from that directed toward Europe, gave rise to the preference to bilateral security dialogue in this region rather than the construction of post-war collective security community such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.66">According to realists, the establishment of economic community is promoted by the existence of security community. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.66">It is also certain that the political instability as a result of the absence of multilateral security community is a risk in constructing economic ties. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.66">
<s n="s1.2;p14.66">On the other hand, it is worth noting that the recent signs implying the incremental change of the U.S. strategy were seen (Bergsten 2000, Curtis 2004). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.66">This will be examined below. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.66">
<s n="s1.3;p15.66">At this time, in reality, Japan was forced by the United States to oppose the East Asia's own regional grouping. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.66">By coincidence, when the EAEC was proposed, Japan was getting into trouble due to the recurring pressure by the United States condemning the non-cooperative attitude to its participation in the Gulf War. </s>

<p n="p16.66">
<s n="s1.2;p16.66">Japan's role in economic cooperation in East Asia also provides one of the answers to some realists who have attempted to identify the reasons of faltering cooperation in this region. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.66">According to Grieco's analysis, based on 'relative disparity shift'<ref target="BAWE_0293a-ftnote.005"/> hypothesis, Japan's dramatically increased economic hegemony from 1970 to 1990, prevented other Asian less-advanced countries from participating in the negotiation for institutionalization of economic cooperation on the grounds of the fear of Japan's power (Grieco 1997, 176-178). </s>

<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.2;pn1.1">According to Grieco, if the relative disparities in capabilities within a region are shifting over time, disadvantaged states tend to become less attracted to institutionalization. </s>
<s n="s2.2;pn1.1">He named this phenomenon as 'capabilities-turbulance hypothesis' in 1994 and renamed it as 'relative disparity shift' later. </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p17.66">
<s n="s1.2;p17.66">European neo-functionalists, who have emphasized the existence of 'supranationality' as a driving force bringing economic cooperation and integration, keep an eye upon the low level of interdependence in spite of the fair degree of intra-regional trade volume in East Asia. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.66">The reduction of transaction cost was regarded as being less needed than in Europe due to the absence of supranational capitalist groups and interest groups in this region. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.66">
<s n="s1.2;p18.66">On the other hand, another strand of neo-functional explanation argues that East Asia inherently doesn't have any necessity of close cooperation. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.66">According to this argument, the openness of the U.S. market, natural economic forces of proximity and the general complementarity in industry (Haggard 1997, 46) enabled the East Asian countries to be competitive enough without substantial regional cooperation. </s>
</p>
<p n="p19.66">
<s n="s1.4;p19.66">As an alternative option that can complement the lack of cooperative institutionalization, neo-functionalists have paid attention to the 'elite bargains' as well. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p19.66">They identified 'elite bargains' between the Commission and business as a driving force through their case study over 'the 1992 movement' (Sandholtz and Zysman 1989, 100). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p19.66">The process of elite-driven policy coordination can also be applied to Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p19.66">According to Higgot, the tripartite community of corporate, research and government have led regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific (Higgot 1998, 50). </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.66">
<s n="s1.1;p20.66">On the other hand, as an antithesis to rationalist approaches, constructivists have emphasized ideational factors and collective identity rather than the political and economic interests that both realists and neo-functionalists principally explored. </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.66">
<s n="s1.2;p21.66">The key argument of liberal constructivism is that collective identity can cause a peaceful shift from anarchy to political community (Higgot 1998, 63). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p21.66">The emphasis of 'collective identity' in East Asia has a relative explanatory power in the light of the common experience of colonial rule by western power in Southeast Asia and the influence of Confucianism in Northeast Asia. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.66">
<s n="s1.2;p22.66">If we agree with Wendt's argument that cooperative process is reconstructing actor's interest in terms of shared commitment to social norms (Wendt 1992, 417), the failure of EAEC can be explained by constructivism. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.66">When it comes to the formation of the East Asian community, Mahathir, the proponent of EAEC, once seemed to pursue an idea of a race-oriented cooperative entity because he maintained a recalcitrant attitude over the participation of Australia, although no other Asian countries oppose its accession to the proposed EAEC. However, East Asian countries failed to form any kind of shared understanding or collective interest in this region. </s>
</p>
<p n="p23.66">
<s n="s1.3;p23.66">Japan's attitude to EAEC was still lukewarm then since it had believed that its own role should be placed on bridging, by linking less-advanced Asia and industrialized Pacific countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand (Terada 2003, 258). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.66">In addition, ethnic diversity and political disorder in Southeast Asian countries also have hindered political and economic cooperation through institutionalization. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.66">In this sense, the lack of shared interest in East Asia - in practice, the physical combination of Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia - was another obstacle to impede cooperation in this region. </s>
</p>
<p n="p24.66">
<s n="s1.5;p24.66">To some extent, these analyses had demonstrated efficient explanatory power to solve the puzzle suggested by the lag of regionalism in East Asia. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p24.66">Indeed, however, everything was changed after the Asian financial crisis since 1997. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p24.66">The multilateral institutions such as APEC and ASEAN in this region played no role to counter the sudden external shock.<ref target="BAWE_0293a-ftnote.006"/> The main agenda surrounding intra-regional economic cooperation seems to be changed from trade liberalization which APEC strongly pushed forward to the more diversified concerns such as narrowing socio-economic gaps (Yu 2005, 41). </s>
<s n="s4.5;p24.66">In particular, disillusionment with the incapability of APEC finally provoked the scepticism over the role of the United States. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p24.66">The disappointment at the United States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) made Asian people and their political leaders begin to dream of the East Asian Community without the U.S. The outcomes of this disillusionment are ASEAN+3 and the growing RTAs. </s>
