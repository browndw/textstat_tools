<s n="s1.5;p95.95">This instrument can be much more effective if other existing but inevitable sources of error like friction, tension of string, reaction speed of person measuring the time, etc can be known so that we get a much more accurate value. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p95.95">The values obtained in this method seem to have a high percentage error and are inconsistent. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p95.95">The accuracy also depends a lot on the instrument being used. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p95.95">Various specimens of this same type of instrument can produce results with a strikingly high variation in them. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p95.95">Hence I think the moment of inertia is best measured using theoretical approaches. </s>
