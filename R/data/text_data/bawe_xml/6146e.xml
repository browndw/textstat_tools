<p n="p13.32">
<s n="s1.2;p13.32">The postal rule was created to sort a problem where different communication methods took varying lengths of time to deliver a response. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p15.32">Delivery of a message does not necessarily mean it has been read. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.32">For example, requiring a computer terminal to read email introduces the idea that a response may not reach a person out of office hours or at the weekend. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.32">
<s n="s1.1;p16.32">Messages such as email will pass through several servers on the way to their destination, making them far less secure than a postal letter, which will show visible signs of tampering if it has been read by any unauthorised persons. </s>

<hi rend="bold">Question 4 - Management vs. Technical Careers</hi> Assume that you are a senior person in a high-technology industrial research organisation. Your management has expressed concern about the effect of "disruptive technologies" on the business. How would you define a strategy for the technical community to recognise and inform the company about potential "disruptive technologies" that are likely to affect the business, either as a threat or as an opportunity? Note that a "disruptive technology" is one which will either radically transform a market, create a wholly new market, or destroy an existing market. (Possible prize to be given by Thales for best strategy)<hi rend="bold">Answer </hi>

<p n="p20.32">
<s n="s1.1;p20.32">Any strategy for dealing with disruptive technology should cover these key parts: </s>

<item>Recognizing disruptive technology.</item>
<item>Knowing when the technology is sufficiently developed to replace old technology.</item>
<item>EITHER</item>
<item>Improving current technology to compete</item>
<item>OR</item>
<item>Finding a migration strategy with minimal disruption to business</item>
</list>
<p n="p21.32">
<s n="s1.6;p21.32">To thoroughly analyse all potential disruptive technologies would be over the top; many technologies often fail to fulfil their expectations, and new standards form slowly over time. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p21.32">Therefore, the technical community must identify issues which it thinks are key to the business success in near future (e.g. the next 3 years). </s>
<s n="s3.6;p21.32">The number of these issues should be kept low (e.g. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p21.32">5 per year). </s>
<s n="s5.6;p21.32">The ideas could be presented annually at a 'new technologies meeting', ensuring that all are properly documented. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p21.32">The long time between meetings will give technical staff time to carefully gauge the impact of a technology. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.32">
<s n="s1.2;p22.32">Should the same technology arise several years in a row, then it should almost certainly be given serious consideration. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p22.32">The company must decide on a plan of action individually for each technology, rather than stick to a regular policy, which could see the company left behind or stranded with unpopular ideas. </s>

<hi rend="bold">Question 5 - Quality</hi> Part 1: What sort of people challenges would you face when introducing a new quality process in a large well established organisation with processes in place already? Part 2: How would you go about implementing these changes?<hi rend="bold">Answer </hi>

<s n="s1.2;p23.32">A new quality process will probably be met with opposition from many employees. </s>

</p>
<p n="p24.32">
<s n="s1.3;p24.32">If not all employees are affected by, or opposed to, the new process, there could be a splitting of the workforce, socially and functionally. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p24.32">Alternatively, if all employees are affected you could be completely ostracized, seen as trying to interfere. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p24.32">Out of spite, or because of a loss of attraction to their job positions, employees might be less motivated. </s>

<p n="p25.32">
