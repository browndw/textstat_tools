Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<s n="s1.5;p1.21">This purpose of this report is to investigate the technology used in the building that could be incorporated into our studio work. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.21">The studio work will lead to a cramming project - a project which focuses on jamming more buildings into an already occupied and currently used site, allowing the site to reach its maximum economic potential. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.21">We have been given a choice of three sites in Oxford. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.21">My chosen site is St. Catherine's College - part of Oxford University. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.21">The idea behind this project is to question beauty against the usefulness of a site. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.21">
<s n="s1.10;p2.21">St. Catherine's College in Oxford was designed by the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p2.21">The college is situated on the east side of Oxford, on the bank of the River Cherwell. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p2.21">The college is a contrast in design to most the other colleges, in that it was built hundreds of years later. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p2.21">It was built between 1962 and 1964. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p2.21">The buildings have of a modern design which is based on the older traditional quadrangle layout of the other colleges. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p2.21">Jacobsen's design of St. Catherine's ranged from the buildings to the furniture and cutlery used inside. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p2.21">Arne Jacobsen took his own approach to the quadrangle based college. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p2.21">Although designed in a different manner, it consists of the main elements - a central quad with lawn, with two rows of student's rooms either side, a garden, chapel and a dining hall. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p2.21">A main feature of the design is a large lily pond. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p2.21">Due to this unique design, the architecture of the college creates a feeling of space, light and peace (St. Catherine's Website, 2006). </s>

<s n="s1.6;p3.21">The college buildings are constructed primarily from glass and concrete. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.21">The techniques used with these materials will be established for my report. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.21">St. Catherine's has a large foot print, and rises up three floors. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.21">Most of the building is residential, providing accommodation for the students. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.21">Each student has their own room, providing somewhere for them to sleep and study. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.21">The college currently houses about 700 students. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.21">
<s n="s1.4;p4.21">Studying the technology, the construction methods, the structures, and environmental issues on this building, will have an effect on the designs of my future studio work. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.21">I hope to have a better awareness of the technologies and concepts of design used in St. Catherine's and the methods used in the original architectural design by Arne Jacobsen. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.21">I believe this should help me to incorporate his architectural forms and concepts into new designs. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.21">I will need to consider every aspect of the buildings design from the foundations to the roof. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.21">
<s n="s1.2;p5.21">Some of the original construction methods may not be used today and so I will need to look into alternatives used presently. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.21">Development in technologies since the building was built will alter the type of materials used and these will need to be researched. </s>
