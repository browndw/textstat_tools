<s n="s1.9;p2.6">Luther's three major treatises of 1520 were entitled <hi rend="italic">To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Freedom of a Christian</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p2.6">In the tract, <hi rend="italic">To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation,</hi> Luther highlights three major errors the papacy had committed: firstly that the pope had power over secular authorities; secondly that only the pope could interpret scripture properly; and thirdly that only the pope could determine church doctrine. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p2.6">Thus Luther was denying the pope's claims to authority. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p2.6">
<hi rend="italic">The Babylonian Captivity of the Church</hi> tackled the issue of sacraments, where Luther reduced the seven traditional sacraments to just two. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p2.6">Only Baptism and the Eucharist had basis in Scripture and thus only they were legitimate rituals. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p2.6">
<hi rend="italic">The Freedom of a Christian</hi> consolidated the view that justification was by faith alone and also declared that Christians should practise brotherly love out of love for God. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p2.6">Good works would flow from faith; they were not a prerequisite for salvation. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p2.6">
<hi rend="italic">The American Edition of Luther's Works</hi> holds the view that 'these three treatises of 1520 are at the heart of Luther's protest against the church of his day'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p2.6">Yet this does not necessarily mean that they were a turning point in the development of his ideas. </s>

</note>
<p n="p3.6">
<s n="s1.22;p3.6">The three treatises had different audiences yet all contained elements of the ideas he outlined in his <hi rend="italic">95 Theses</hi>. </s>
<s n="s2.22;p3.6">The main aim of the <hi rend="italic">95 Theses</hi> was his attack against indulgences, 'Therefore those preachers of indulgences are in error, who say that by the pope's indulgences a man is freed from every penalty, and saved'. </s>
<s n="s3.22;p3.6">He denied the pope ability to forgive sins, 'The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring that it has been remitted by God'. </s>
<s n="s4.22;p3.6">Although he criticised the papacy, his ideas were not yet fully developed to deny the pope any power or authority whatsoever. </s>
<s n="s5.22;p3.6">Yet by 1520 Luther came to recognise the pope as the Antichrist. </s>
<s n="s6.22;p3.6">In <hi rend="italic">To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation</hi>, he beseeches the German nobility to 'set itself against the pope as against a common enemy and destroyer of Christendom'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.004"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.22;p3.6">This is a much harsher rebuke than in the <hi rend="italic">95 Theses.</hi> </s>
<s n="s8.22;p3.6">Luther had also already started to formulate his ideas on justification prior to the writing of the three major treatises. </s>
<s n="s9.22;p3.6">Christ's death on the cross redeemed human kind once and for all; there was no need for indulgences or good works. </s>
<s n="s10.22;p3.6">'First a sinner was "justified" in the sense that the guilt of his sins, which deserves God's anger and punishment, was suddenly and unconditionally forgiven'. </s>
<s n="s11.22;p3.6">Good works were then a result of this as the 'believers soul was renewed from inside by the Holy Spirit' in a process called "sanctification". </s>
<s n="s12.22;p3.6">However, Cameron believes that these ideas did not 'spring fully grown from the mind of Luther' but his 'mature view seems to have been established by 1519-20'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.005"/> particularly in <hi rend="italic">The Freedom of a Christian.</hi> </s>
<s n="s13.22;p3.6">'Therefore it is clear that, as the soul needs only the Word of God for life and righteousness, so it is justified by faith alone and not by any works'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.006"/>. </s>
<s n="s14.22;p3.6">It therefore appears that Luther's previous beliefs were not only developed in the later treatises but also, in fact, reached a crucial stage whereby Luther rejected the authority of the pope and rejected his claims to be the only one with power to interpret scripture. </s>
<s n="s15.22;p3.6">This was a major turning point and led to a separation from Rome on Luther's behalf. </s>
<s n="s16.22;p3.6">Prior to the 1520 treatises Luther had already identified the three requisites for a Christian and for salvation. </s>
<s n="s17.22;p3.6">These were <hi rend="italic">sola gratia, sola fida and sola scriptura.</hi> </s>
<s n="s18.22;p3.6">Humankind is saved by the grace of God alone; it is only through faith that one can receive this grace; and only scripture can be trusted and relied upon as the absolute authority. </s>
<s n="s19.22;p3.6">These were the very core ideas of Luther's theology, yet it had been developed in most part before 1520. </s>
<s n="s20.22;p3.6">This was what Luther later described in 1545 as his 'liberating discovery." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.007"/>
<s n="s21.22;p3.6">Yet it could be argued that his 1520 treatises laid out in detail the discoveries he had learnt in previous years, as 'between 1513 and 1519 he experienced a series of breakthroughs'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s22.22;p3.6">His treatises thus mark a turning point in that after 1520 none of his fundamental ideas changed much. </s>

<s n="s7.21;p4.6">In <hi rend="italic">The Blessed Sacrament of the Holy and True Body of Christ</hi> (1519) he wrote, 'To receive this sacrament in bread and wine, then, is nothing else than to receive a sure sign of this fellowship and union with Christ and all the saints." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.010"/>
<s n="s8.21;p4.6">For Luther, the sacrament depended on the faith of the participant rather than on the nature of it. </s>
<s n="s9.21;p4.6">Yet Luther's ideas were still influenced by the Catholic tradition as although he denied transubstantiation, he continued to believe in a "Real Presence" of Christ in the food. </s>
<s n="s10.21;p4.6">This was an issue which caused division and disagreement among Protestants later on. </s>
<s n="s11.21;p4.6">Luther's work <hi rend="italic">The Adoration of the Sacrament</hi> of 1523 describes his views on this sacrament in a more developed way to in <hi rend="italic">The Babylonian Captivity of the Church</hi> yet was not altogether new. </s>
<s n="s12.21;p4.6">He simply described in more detail an already-held belief. </s>
<s n="s13.21;p4.6">Baptism was also a much-discussed issue, despite not causing quite so much controversy as the Eucarist. </s>
<s n="s14.21;p4.6">In 1522 Luther had to answer Melanchton's letter which explained that Zwickau Prophets were challenging infant baptism. </s>
<s n="s15.21;p4.6">In 1529 his <hi rend="italic">Large Catechism</hi> expanded on the ideas he outlined in his reply to Melanchton. </s>
<s n="s16.21;p4.6">Luther believed that infant baptism was permissible, as 'the "ignorant" child is not baptized because of its faith but because of God's promise<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.011"/>. </s>
<s n="s17.21;p4.6">By claiming that children cannot understand or accept God's promise changes the sacrament 'from the work of God into the work of man'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s18.21;p4.6">This does appear to contradict the view expressed in <hi rend="italic">The Babylonian Captivity of the Church</hi> where he affirms that, 'unless it does believe this, it cannot be saved, because it does not believe the truth of God that promises salvation'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.013"/>. </s>
<s n="s19.21;p4.6">A child cannot believe in the promise because it does not understand it. </s>
<s n="s20.21;p4.6">So it would appear that his views were developed slightly on this matter. </s>
<s n="s21.21;p4.6">Yet opinions on infant baptism were not fundamental to the Christian faith, so although details may have changed or been modified following 1520, the basic ideas remained the same. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.015"/>
<s n="s8.10;p5.6">Luther's declaration that all Christians were members of a "universal priesthood" did cause some troubles in the 1520s as people sought to exercise that new power. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p5.6">Thus after the 1520s 'he started to emphasize the need for a rite of ordination and the proper coordination of the ministry.' </s>
<s n="s10.10;p5.6">He wrote subsequent tracts on this subject, such as <hi rend="italic">On the Council and the Church</hi> (1539), yet 'he never lost sight of the central principle behind his understanding of the Church: "...the whole substance and life of the Church is the Word of God."'<ref target="BAWE_0063c-ftnote.016"/> So although Luther did continue to develop his ideas after 1520, his key theology had already been formulated, it was just a matter of deciding on the practical changes that would need to be made. </s>
