<s n="s1.5;p60.66">During freezing ice crystals are formed. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p60.66">These ice crystals have a lower water vapour pressure than regions within the cell, and water moves from the cell to the growing crystals. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p60.66">Cells becomes dehydrated and permanently damaged by the increase solute concentration collapsed and deform structure. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p60.66">On thawing cells don't regain their original shape and turgidity. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p60.66">Food is softened and cellular materials leaks out from ruptured cells i.e. drip loss (Fellows, P.J 2000). </s>
</p>
<p n="p61.66">
<s n="s1.5;p61.66">Drip loss in frozen foods depends on the intrinsic factors to the food product itself and freezing and thawing conditions. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p61.66">Thawing drip loss is usually unattractive, soluble nutrients are lost. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p61.66">Freezing is effectively dehydration process in which water is removed from its original location and collected in the form of ice crystals. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p61.66">During thawing, water may or may not be absorbed into its original location. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p61.66">Factors that determines thawing drip loss include size and location of the ice crystal with respect to tissue structure, rate of thawing, rate and extent if water reabsorption, physiological/ biochemical status of tissues prior to freezing and intrinsic water binding strength in the tissue prior to freezing. </s>

<p n="p62.66">
<s n="s1.5;p62.66">Recrystallisation in frozen foods occurs when small crystals with higher specific energy compared to large crystals, lose moisture and eventually disappear leading to formation of large crystals. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p62.66">Temperature fluctuations greatly accelerate rate of crystallization. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p62.66">During re-cooling moisture from this crystals will diffuse towards the remaining large crystals rather than forming new crystals. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p62.66">This effect affects texture of the food products. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p62.66">Food products with low freezing point are more sensitive to recrystallization (Erickson and Hung, 1997). </s>

<p n="p63.66">
<s n="s1.5;p63.66">Chilling is a process where by temperature of a food is reduced to between -1 and 8 <hi rend="sup">0</hi>C used to reduce the rate of biochemical and microbiological changes. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p63.66">Chilling reduces growth of thermophilic and many mesophilic microorganisms. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p63.66">Main concern microorganisms with chilled foods are number of pathogens that can grow on storage temperatures. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p63.66">It is essential good manufacturing practices are enforced during production and packaging of chilled foods. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p63.66">However, selection of sound raw materials for processing of chilled food is important so as to have sound raw materials i.e. of good quality, few vegetative/ spoilage microorganisms. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">CONCLUSIONS</head>
<p n="p65.66">
<s n="s1.3;p65.66">The main effect of freezing on food quality is the damage caused to cell by ice crystal growth. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p65.66">Freezing causes negligible changes to tissues, flavour and nutritional components. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p65.66">As there are several methods of freezing techniques which can be applied to food products but they do differ on energy consumption, desirable and undesirable effects they do bring about in food products. </s>
</p>
<p n="p66.66">
<s n="s1.4;p66.66">Example vacuum freezing is often used as a preliminary step for freezing drying, plate freezing is mostly applicable to food products which can be placed in plates during freezing although it is time consuming during loading and offloading. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p66.66">Blast freezing are flexible i.e. can be used to freeze any time of food products but moisture from the food is transferred to the air and builds up as ice on the refrigeration coils, on which with time it needs to be removed by defrosting of which it can be un economical and wastage of time in large scale industries. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p66.66">Liquid nitrogen is expensive and mostly reserved for expensive products and the products that can be frozen in less than 1 minute. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p66.66">As the size of foods increase, conduction within the food becomes the limiting resistance. </s>
