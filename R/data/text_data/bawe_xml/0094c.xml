<s n="s4.7;p1.17">Yet, there have not been any significant signs of recovery, even though it can be argued that there are prospects for a good economic year 2005 in the US. Nevertheless, oil price is a factor that can endanger the positive development in the economy and in can pose a problem in the trade deficit that the country struggles with. </s>

<s n="s6.7;p1.17">The uncertainty of the US economy is reflected on the other economies of the world, particularly on the Asian ones, but Euro Area has suffered from the fluctuations as well. </s>

<p n="p2.17">
<s n="s1.4;p2.17">The 1990s was a period of growth and economic boom in the US. This result is partly related to the optimism that the end of Cold War created in the world economy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.17">The US was growing strongly due to emergence of new technology, which became known amongst the economists as "the new economy" boom. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.17">There was a sustained increase in the growth of productivity, which was largely explained by new inventions. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.17">These inventions induced massive investment and the confidence in the financial markets was high. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.17">
<s n="s1.3;p3.17">It can be argued that between the years 1992-2000 there was a virtuous circle of economy in the US. The US gross domestic product (GDP) was growing fast and this facilitated a growth in investment, which in turn caused GDP to grow. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.17">As interest rates were low, high investment was made possible. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.17">The multiplier-accelerator action in the US was strong and the information technology (IT) industry was booming until the year 2000.<ref target="BAWE_0094c-ftnote.001"/> In that year the IT sector experienced a heavy downturn as the stocks had been overvalued and the so-called "dot.com" companies were falling one after another.<ref target="BAWE_0094c-ftnote.002"/> As the stocks of "dot.com" firms were rocketing up, it was clear that this development could not be long-lived, as there were no indications that there could be production growth in those firms could respond to the huge investment that was directed to the industry.<ref target="BAWE_0094c-ftnote.003"/> These firms were, if anything, destroying wealth rather than creating it. </s>

<s n="s1.7;p17.17">The US economy has arguably gone through a strong boom followed by a rapid recession since the early 1990s, but there is no clear indication how the economy will perform during the year 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.7;p17.17">There is a cautious optimism as the US economic policy seems to work so far, but the danger posed by budget and trading deficits, weak dollar and high oil prices indicates that there are no grounds for confidence yet. </s>
<s n="s3.7;p17.17">The World Economy is in a volatile state and the implications that the performance of the US economy has on the world, particularly on Asia, are not clearly seen. </s>
<s n="s4.7;p17.17">The stock markets show uncertainty, but the consumer confidence is recovering. </s>
<s n="s5.7;p17.17">Much depends on the economic policy of the US government, whether they succeed in their attempts to keep inflation low and interest rates at appropriate levels. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p17.17">It is not clear whether the slowdown is about to end, or to get worse. </s>
<s n="s7.7;p17.17">The prospects for the year 2005 are still questionable and indicate in my opinion that the slowdown has not reached its end yet. </s>
