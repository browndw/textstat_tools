<s n="s1.7;p38.42">Even though <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> is a category three organism which should be handled with utmost care, it still causes laboratory acquired infections. </s>

<head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head>
<p n="p39.42">
<s n="s1.5;p39.42">
<hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> is one of the most virulent organisms known. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p39.42">It has numerous reservoirs which can never be eradicated from the environment and as such we can never be free from the threat of this pathogen. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p39.42">If dispersed by an aerosol, <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> has the potential to infect thousands of people in the pneumonic form of tularemia, which is the most serious. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p39.42">This combined with a low infectious does will have disastrous consequences. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p39.42">If medical personnel are unable to recognize tularemia and threat it accordingly, resources will be inefficiently used and more importantly deaths can occur. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.42">
<s n="s1.8;p40.42">
<hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> is so virulent because it is able to evade the immune system effectively. </s>
<s n="s2.8;p40.42">Its lipid capsule prevents phagocytosis and lysis by complement, the acid phosphatase enzyme prevents respiratory burst and is able to inhibit cytokine release by the macrophages. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p40.42">However, the lipopolysaccharide layer of the cell envelope does not act as an endotoxin. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p40.42">This is the extent of the knowledge available concerning the virulence of <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p40.42">One suggestion as to why its virulence characteristics have not been elucidated to is its unique genome. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p40.42">Although <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> is related to other genres, its genome encodes 1,804 open reading frames, 1,289 of which encode proteins of which 413 are unique to <hi rend="italic">Franciscella4</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p40.42">This indicates that <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> may posses many unique genes which may confer unique virulence factors as yet undiscovered and not adapted to the human host. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p40.42">Vital research must therefore occur in order to increase understanding of this pathogen such as how it penetrates the gut in gastrointestinal tularemia. </s>
</p>
<p n="p41.42">
<s n="s1.6;p41.42">The use of biological weapons is not a new phenomenon. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p41.42">Japan experimented with biological agents during the world wars, as did Iraq and Iran in the gulf war and most recently anthrax attacks occurred in America in 2001. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p41.42">A real example of the threat and the scale of destruction biological weapons can cause has yet to arise. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p41.42">Even with careful planning and exercises such as the Hanuman Redux Exercise, Louisville Kentucky USA, 2001, nations cannot adequately prepare themselves for biological attacks. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p41.42">The Centre for Disease Control concluded that the Hanuman Redux exercise handled the situation adequately and effectively. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p41.42">Models determined that 200,000 people would have been exposed resulting in 4,800 cases and 1,700 <hi rend="sup">8</hi> deaths and in 1970 the WHO reported that an aerosol dispersal of 50kg of virulent <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> over a metropolitan area with 5 million inhabitants would result in 250,000 incapacitating casualties including 19,000 deaths <hi rend="sup">9</hi>. </s>
</p>
<p n="p42.42">
<s n="s1.1;p42.42">With continuous threats from extremist groups and the availability of <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> and information concerning this organism we will always be living in the threat of a natural outbreak or attack from this highly virulent pathogen. </s>
