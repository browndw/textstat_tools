<s n="s1.1;p1.64">I happened upon "Better than Sex" by chance, at a book sale at the Student Union.Beyond the cheekiness of the title, the cover image and subtitle immediately conveyed what the topic and tone would be, in what I thought to be a strikingly well chosen combination. </s>

<p n="p2.64">
<s n="s1.1;p2.64">"Better than Sex" was published and promoted by Random House Australia in 2004, but - surprisingly to me, at first - never sold Italian (or any other language) translation rights.After less than two years from a successful publication, because of its current affairs content, it is outdated and realistically impossible to sell: therefore "Better than Sex" makes for an interesting case study on why foreign rights are bought (or not bought), allowing the perspective to analyse what happened in hindsight. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p3.64">"Better than Sex" was published by Random House Australia in paperback, on June 1st 2004; the authors are two Australian journalists, who write about work environment and office organisation for a Financial Times magazine called AFT Boss.One of them, Helen Trinca, was heavily involved in the publicity for the book, which included a well-balanced and well-paced succession of press releases, radio talks<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.001"/>, participation in conferences and seminars<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.002"/>, and reviews<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.003"/>. </s>

<p n="p7.64">
<s n="s1.1;p7.64">focusing on a single country allows them to go more in depth in their investigation, and Australia is their area of expertise: so their sources and examples are always Australian. </s>

<quote lang="English">Professor Amanda Sinclair of the Melbourne Business School says that work may be the only thing that answers the question of why we are here(Trinca and Fox, 2004, p. 9).</quote>
<p n="p8.64">
<s n="s1.1;p8.64">Beyond this understandable degree of self-reference, in my opinion, the authors have needlessly made the book hard to sell to foreign countries.Their subject matter could easily be interesting to readers in the Western countries who are going through similar workplace developments, but the continuous referrals to Australian cities and companies are distracting. </s>

<quote lang="English">We word in a swish high-rise building in central Sidney.It's a far cry from the grimy rabbit warrens of the news-paper offices of our past. Those offices - News Limited, on the edge of the CBD near Central railway station, and Fairfax, a little further along the ugly, frenetic stretch of Sydney that becomes Parramatta Road - were legendary for their lack of gloss and aesthetic appeal(Trinca and Fox, 2004, p. 14).</quote>

<quote lang="English">As well, many Australians work outside our narrow workspace. [...] In Australia's factories, work is far more regimented, with employees held to strict break times and with little chance to leave work to pick up the dry cleaning or run to the ATM(Trinca and Fox, 2004, p. 16).</quote>

<s n="s1.1;p11.64">There are instances in which "Better than Sex" mentions facts, people or companies which readers from many countries, including Italy, would not be familiar with. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Take your pick - from the brown-beaten cynicism of <hi rend="italic">Dilbert</hi> to the boosterism of flash mags like <hi rend="italic">Fast Company</hi>, there are plenty of ways to talk about what work is like right now(Trinca and Fox, 2004, p. 3).</quote>
<p n="p12.64">
<s n="s1.1;p12.64">However annoyingly, these instances could be easily explained in simple footnotes, and are not essential to the contents of the book.After all, American children have enjoyed reading "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" for decades without knowing exactly what Turkish delight is. </s>

<p n="p13.64">
<s n="s1.1;p13.64">There is no doubt about the existence of a market segment in Italy, similar to that of Australian "Better than Sex" target readers, made up of 30-to-45-year-old professionals who are dedicated to their work and identify with their careers.They are the ones reading Capital (a monthly magazine about the lives and lifestyle of successful managers) and business management manuals, of which a new series, e.g., has been launched by the "La Repubblica" newspaper in the first quarter of 2006<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.006"/>.In October 2004, the results of the 5th research on Italians' social capital (about the relationship between Italians and work) were published<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.007"/>, revealing that: </s>

<div2>
<head rend="bold">4.1. Words and language used</head>
<p n="p44.64">
<s n="s1.2;p44.64">The vocabulary the authors use is simple to translate, with no use of either technical or slang/local terms.The main difficulty would be in the lack, in the Italian language, of different words for "job" and "work".While both can be translated into "lavoro", and "job" can be turned into "occupazione" for clarity's sake, either confusing repetitions or lengthier translations are bound to happen. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p44.64">The book is laden with expressions that require the use of the word "lavoro" in some form (going to work, work place, working hours, getting the job done, etc.), and Italian is a language in which repetition is minded more than in English. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">We were increasingly interested in work as a concept, something that was bigger than the job(Trinca and Fox, 2004, p. 5).</quote>
<quote lang="Italian" rend="italic">Ci interessavamo sempre di più al lavoro come concetto: qualcosa che va oltre la semplice occupazione. </quote>
<p n="p45.64">
<s n="s1.1;p45.64">The few play on words are not essential in the text, while the title bears the fortunate possibility of adding a catchy one: "how a whole generation got hooked on work" can be translated into "come un'intera generazione è passata dal lavoro da dipendente alla dipendenza dal lavoro", playing on the double meaning of the Italian "dipendenza" as either "employment" or "addiction". </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">4.2. Tone</head>
<p n="p46.64">
<s n="s1.3;p46.64">As the authors themselves say in the introduction to the book - in case the title wasn't an obvious clue - they felt "a certain brio" about this project. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p46.64">They didn't want to write a despairing critique about the oppressive role of work in today's professionals' lives, hence "Better than Sex" is an upbeat and readable book.The tone is informal though not colloquial, closer to that of self-help books than academic ones. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p46.64">It is in fact the same tone that journalists of AFR Boss magazine use for their articles. </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">Perhaps the biggest paradox is the sense that many of us are on the job even when not physically present at the office. This is one of the big shifts in the way we see work. It's not accidental, of course. Imagine your job is to produce a batch of perfect T-shirts at a factory(Trinca and Fox, 2004, p. 17).</quote>
<p n="p47.64">
<s n="s1.1;p47.64">While making the book enjoyable, this tone is also an important determinant in placing the book: "Better than Sex" is essentially a trade book, and should therefore be promoted to trade publishers. </s>

<head rend="bold">4.3. Research grants and funding</head>
<p n="p48.64">
<s n="s1.1;p48.64">"Better than Sex" being neither an academic sociological work, nor a book of significant literary value, it is improbable that it would obtain funding from bodies such as the Australia Council, which promotes national culture in all of its expressions.As of May 2006, there were no grants open for application which would suit the proposed title: of the four available for literature, three relate to creative writing and one was open for publishers only until mid-March<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.019"/>. </s>

<p n="p49.64">
<s n="s1.2;p49.64">For the same reasons why "Better than Sex" is not eligible for funding, the cost of its translation should be contained.The book is in fact translatable by anyone who has a sound knowledge of the common English language, and doesn't require specific knowledge or skills; the Italian publisher therefore could pay a freelancer, perhaps one who is eager to gain some experience, and pay around € 7-8 per standard page (30 lines of 60 characters, excluding spaces, or 2000 characters including them). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p49.64">A professional translator would charge around €9.50-10, an established one €12-13.Rates for non-technical translation of English to Italian are particularly low, as the competition is very strong; for specialist topics, the rates are raised to about €10-15-20, depending on the expertise of the translator<ref target="BAWE_3045e-endnote.020"/>. </s>

<p n="p64.64">
<s n="s1.3;p64.64">The economics of the book don't work. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p64.64">The cost of the translation is not excessive, but the window of opportunity for sales, given the current-journalistic style and the seasonality in sales of business books, is extremely small. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p64.64">To reach break-even on a print-run that would make production costs low enough to keep the price down, given the light non-academic tone, a disproportionate investment in marketing would have been necessary, throwing the figures off balance. </s>
