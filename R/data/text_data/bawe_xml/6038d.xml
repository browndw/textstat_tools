<p n="p1.84">
<s n="s1.4;p1.84">The notion of quantification empowers language by providing the facility to generalise from specific individual instances of an attribute to a collection, or quantity, of instances which share that same attribute. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.84">In Linguistics, the term 'quantifier' is used to cover all expressions of contrasts in quantity which range from determiners and pronominal items such as <hi rend="italic">all (of), every, each (of), some (of), few, many (of), both (of), neither(of), the first (of),</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> ten (of)</hi>, to adverbial forms such as <hi rend="italic">sometimes,</hi> <hi rend="italic">always, seldom, never,</hi> <hi rend="italic">hardly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scarcely.</hi> </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.84">In Semantics, specifically in Predicate Calculus, the term 'quantifier' is used to explore the truth value of propositions with respect to the relative scope of Universal Quantifiers () such as <hi rend="italic"> every, each, none, no-one,</hi> i.e., 'all', and Existential Quantifiers () such as <hi rend="italic">many, a few, both, two,</hi> i.e., 'some', Lyons (1977). </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.84">This analysis in logic has led to a deeper understanding of the nature of quantifiers in natural language. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.84">
<s n="s1.4;p2.84">Quantifiers constitute a universal semantic category in all natural languages, however, there are systematic differences in the manner in which they are manifested grammatically in negative and interrogative clauses across languages. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.84">The primary purpose of this essay is to explore the extent to which the behaviour of quantifiers can be satisfactorily captured by syntactic rules, in these two grammatical environments, in contemporary English. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.84">This exercise has revealed that there is currently no theory that adequately accounts for the interaction between quantifiers and syntactic rules, semantic interpretations, scope relationships between elements of the clause and the influence of pragmatic factors. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.84">Despite the complexity of these interactions, the structure of this essay is designed to address these areas in turn in order to clarify the issues relating to each domain and signal the links between them. </s>

<head rend="bold">The Nature of Quantifiers</head>
<p n="p3.84">
<s n="s1.3;p3.84">Lyons (1977:455) defines quantifiers as "modifiers which combine with nouns to produce expressions whose reference is thereby determined in terms of the size of the set of individuals or in terms of the amount of substance that is being referred to." </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.84">As noted in the Introduction, quantifying expressions belong to a variety of grammatical classes and no consistent nomenclature appears to be used for classifying them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.84">Examples of the specific quantifiers selected for the current purposes, on the basis of their relevance to a syntactic analysis of negative and interrogative clauses, are classified by Downing and Locke (2003) as follows: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Distributive Deictic Determinative:</item>
<item>Adjectives - <hi rend="italic">all, every, each, both, either, neither, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Pronouns - <hi rend="italic">all of, each of, both of, neither of, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Non-exact Quantifying Determinative: </item>
<item>Adjectives - <hi rend="italic">much, many, little, few, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Pronouns - <hi rend="italic">much of, many of, little of, a few of, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Assertive: </item>
<item>Determinatives and Pronouns: <hi rend="italic">some, one, someone/body, something, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Adverbs: <hi rend="italic">somewhere, somehow, sometimes, already, still, to some extent, a lot, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Non-Assertive: </item>
<item>Determinatives and Pronouns: <hi rend="italic">any, either, anyone/body, anything, etc.</hi> </item>
<item>Adverbs: <hi rend="italic">anywhere, anyhow, ever, yet, any longer, at all, much, etc.</hi> </item>
</list>
<p n="p4.84">
<s n="s1.2;p4.84">The terms Assertive and Non-Assertive are crucial to many of the arguments covered in this essay. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.84">Downing and Locke (2003:173) define them as follows: </s>
</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>"Assertive forms ..... have factual meanings and typically occur in positive declarative clauses." For example:</item>
<item>(1) <formula notation="" id="BAWE_6038d-form.001"/>
</item>
<item>"Non-Assertive forms ..... are associated with non-factual meanings in the sense of non-fulfilment or potentiality and occur typically in many syntactic contexts ..... of which interrogative clauses and negative clauses are perhaps the most common." </item>
<item>(2) <formula notation="" id="BAWE_6038d-form.002"/>
</item>
<item>(3) <formula notation="" id="BAWE_6038d-form.003"/>
</item>
</list>
<p n="p5.84">
<s n="s1.3;p5.84">Assertive and non-assertive forms are also known as Affirmative and Negative Polar Items (API, NPI). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.84">The effect on polar items of interrogative and negative constructions will be discussed in more detail in the next section since these environments are directly pertinent to the theme of this essay, however, NPIs may also be licensed by other syntactic contexts. </s>

<p n="p6.84">
<s n="s1.2;p6.84">A couple of additional points need to be emphasised here regarding the quantifiers <hi rend="italic">some</hi> and <hi rend="italic">any</hi> before moving onto the effects of syntactic environment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p6.84">Firstly, Downing and Lock (2003) identify that although <hi rend="italic">some</hi> has a 'specific' meaning in factual assertive contexts, as in: </s>

<p n="p8.84">
<s n="s1.1;p8.84">
<hi rend="italic">some</hi> can also have a 'non-specific' meaning in non-assertive contexts, as in: </s>

<p n="p9.84">
<s n="s1.1;p9.84">(13) <formula notation="" id="BAWE_6038d-form.013"/> </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.84">
<s n="s1.2;p10.84">Secondly, <hi rend="italic">any(one)</hi> has two distinct meanings. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.84">Downing and Lock (2003:175) state that in sentences such as (3) above, <hi rend="italic">anyone</hi> is "inherently unstressed", whereas in the following declarative sentence: </s>

<s n="s1.2;p12.84">
<hi rend="italic">anyone</hi> is "inherently stressed". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.84">The implications of these different terms will be discussed in more detail later. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.84">
<s n="s1.1;p13.84">Finally, despite the range of quantifiers outlined here, the main arguments that relate to this essay topic will mainly make reference to the following subset: <hi rend="italic">some, any, every</hi> and <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">Negative and Interrogative Contexts</head>
<p n="p14.84">
<s n="s1.2;p14.84">Unlike the process of negating laws of propositional logic, the application of the negative form in natural language can produce effects that generate a variety of meanings depending on the context. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.84">Ladusaw (1996:322) states that "The fact that natural language sentences are routinely associated with presuppositions about the contexts in which they may be used means that negation is not generally contradictory with respect to the full domain of contexts but at best contradictory only with respect to the range of contexts in which the presuppositions of the sentence are satisfied." </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.84">
<s n="s1.2;p15.84">Furthermore, Hoeksema (2000:117) points out that artificial languages employ negation but exhibit no concept of polar-sensitivity, therefore suggesting that "polar-sensitivity is not logically necessary, but a deeply engrained feature of natural language." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.84">These quotes set the scene for the arguments that follow in later sections regarding the behaviour of quantifiers in negative syntactic environments. </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.84">
<s n="s1.3;p16.84">This essay title asks for a statement on the syntactic rules governing quantifiers in negative and interrogative contexts, both of which are non-assertive environments. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p16.84">Analysis of the literature reveals that syntactic rules pertaining to interrogative clauses are considerably more straightforward than those relating to negative contexts, an observation that is borne out by the massive discrepancy in the number of studies carried out in these areas, the latter being disproportionately more extensive and sophisticated. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p16.84">For this reason, and given that the majority of the arguments relating to interrogative clauses have already been outlined in section 2, the remainder of this essay will focus on the behaviour of quantifiers in negative clauses. </s>

<p n="p18.84">
<s n="s1.2;p18.84">Example (2) illustrated that the process of negating the verb in an assertive clause has the effect of converting it to a non-assertive clause. </s>

<p n="p41.84">
<s n="s1.1;p41.84">To introduce this area, the following example from Quirk et al (1985:788) illustrates neatly how alternative uses of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> and <hi rend="italic">any</hi> in the same syntactic structure can modify the scope of these operators as indicated by the horizontal brackets: </s>

<s n="s1.2;p44.84">The scope of the negative in (24) does not include the quantifier, therefore the NPI <hi rend="italic">any</hi> is not licensed, whereas it is in (25) where negative scope extends to the end of the clause. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p44.84">These examples demonstrate relative scope where two logical elements are in competition for the widest scope. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">The Left-to-Right Rule</head>
<p n="p45.84">
<s n="s1.2;p45.84">The traditional view from Predicate Logic is that precedence of scope is based on the relative order of operators from left to right, as stated by Baker (1995:411) in the rule: "In determining the relative scope of quantity words and negatives, assign scope on the basis of the left-to-right position in the sentence, starting with wider scope for whatever is found on the left." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p45.84">Examples (24) and (25) clearly illustrate the limitations of this rule on the basis of sentence surface structure. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Non-Assertive Rule</head>
<p n="p46.84">
<s n="s1.2;p46.84">In addressing the issue of the negative exhibiting wider scope than the quantifier, Baker (1995:411) also defines the Non-Assertive Rule as: "Nonassertive words are used in situations in which they fall within the scope of a negation, i.e., situations in which they have narrower scope than some negative word." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p46.84">Baker widened the domain of application of this rule to include the scope of conditional clauses and comparative expressions, as illustrated in (6) and (7), in the Extended Nonassertive Rule. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Assertive Rule</head>
<p n="p47.84">
<s n="s1.2;p47.84">Despite these rules, it appears that there are still exceptions where the polar item does not have narrower scope as seen in (24). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p47.84">Baker (1995:417) encapsulates the requirements that license the use of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> in (24) by the two following rules: "Assertives are interpreted as having wider scope than negatives", and "The Left-to-right rule may be relaxed for assertive words." </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="underlined">Universal Rule</head>
<p n="p48.84">
<s n="s1.4;p48.84">Finally, Baker (1995:418) identified the Universal Rule which states that: "The universal words <hi rend="italic">all</hi> and <hi rend="italic">every</hi> may fall within the scope of a negative word even when they occur to its left." </s>
<s n="s2.4;p48.84">Thus, Baker's work has articulated some essential ground rules for interpreting the scope relations between negation and quantifiers. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p48.84">A much earlier study by Ioup (1975) explored a number of other factors that affect scope interpretations that again defy the predictions of the Left-to-Right Rule. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p80.84">The stressed form, example (14), is often represented by a separate lexical expression in other languages, (e.g., in Italian, qualcuno / nessuno are unstressed whereas chiunque / qualsiasi are stressed), and it would seem that if these linguistic alternatives continue to survive in other languages, there is good justification for them given their differences in meaning. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p80.84">Lyons reports that logicians and philosophers have viewed stressed <hi rend="italic">any</hi> as being equivalent to the universal quantifier owing to the similarly wide scope relationships associated with <hi rend="italic">each, every</hi> and <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p80.84">I find this approach reasonable because in Italian, the terms for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> or <hi rend="italic">every</hi> are sometimes used to emphasise or in place of the stressed form of <hi rend="italic">any</hi>. </s>

<p n="p82.84">
<s n="s1.5;p82.84">There is no doubt that the study of quantifiers, particularly in the context of negative clauses has presented logicians and linguists alike with a number of perplexing and contradictory phenomena. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p82.84">In sections 2 and 3, this essay articulated the syntactic rules relating to quantifiers in negative and interrogative clauses in about 500 words, and then proceeded in subsequent sections to discuss the exceptions in a further 2,000 words. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p82.84">A number of illustrations have been presented where grammatically acceptable clauses contain configurations that appear to defy syntactic rules, and where the locus and range of scope items appear to interact with other elements in the clause. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p82.84">In particular, there is plenty of evidence that Conversational Implicature and Negative Implicature influence the interpretation of quantifying expressions in certain contexts. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p82.84">Moreover, it appears that the full impact of the role of lexical semantics in the context of scope ambiguity is far from fully explained. </s>
</p>
<p n="p83.84">
<s n="s1.4;p83.84">Quantifiers are of particular interest to logicians and linguists for two reasons. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p83.84">Firstly, their inclusion in propositional statements has provided formal logic with the tools to progress from Propositional to Predicate Calculus. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p83.84">Secondly, the process of Quantifier Raising allows the syntactician to derive the Logical Form of the proposition from surface structure. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p83.84">However, despite their critical role in these domains of analysis, the quantifier, in particular in its interaction with negation, appears to raise more questions than it answers. </s>
</p>
<p n="p84.84">
<s n="s1.2;p84.84">It is concluded, therefore, that syntactic rules alone are insufficient to predict the behaviour of quantifiers in negative and interrogative sentences. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p84.84">It is certain that this area will present the logician and linguist with a wealth of challenges for many years to come before a fully integrated, explanatory theory of quantifiers has been identified. </s>
