<s n="s6.11;p3.12">But the Act probably envisaged cases where the egg may be anonymously<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.006"/> donated and holding such an individual as legal parent would be unnecessarily complicated since the donor usually has no intention to start a relationship with the resulting child. </s>

<s n="s3.17;p4.12">The HFEA 1990 only applies in cases where the treatment services are provided in clinics licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. </s>
<s n="s4.17;p4.12">It is safe to conclude that the private clinic in this case is licensed by the Authority.<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.008"/> Thus according to section 28(6)(a) of the HFEA 1990 a sperm donor who has consented to use of his genetic material for the purposes of treatment services will not be treated as the father of the child. </s>
<s n="s5.17;p4.12">This is reiterated in numerous cases such as <hi rend="italic">Re Q (Parental Order)</hi> (1996)<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.009"/> where Johnson J stated the law that "[t]he sperm was donated at a clinic under a licensed arrangement so that the donor is not the father, this being one of the exceptions under s 28(6)." </s>
<s n="s6.17;p4.12">Therefore Celia does not have a legal father and Beatrice is her only legal parent. </s>
<s n="s7.17;p4.12">This would seem to be an oddity in law since section 13(5)<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.010"/> HFEA 1990 provides that treatment services are subject to the welfare of a child including the need of a child for a father. </s>
<s n="s8.17;p4.12">This statement has been held to be prejudicial towards lesbians who wish to beget a child but case law<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.011"/> shows a growing acceptance that the 'traditional' and 'conventional' family is no longer the only concept of family. </s>
<s n="s9.17;p4.12">Thus lesbians e.g. in this instance can now have a child of their own although the resulting child has no legal father. </s>
<s n="s10.17;p4.12">However a sperm donor in an unregulated setting will still be considered the legal father in common law. </s>
<s n="s11.17;p4.12">This seems consistent with law; striving to deter informal AID but simultaneously providing for the resulting child to have a legal father. </s>
<s n="s12.17;p4.12">Is this justifiable? </s>
<s n="s13.17;p4.12">It is if viewed in respect of freedom of the parties. </s>
<s n="s14.17;p4.12">They are aware of the legal consequences and should be ready to bear them. </s>
<s n="s15.17;p4.12">Since having a child in these circumstances is a complex issue we would assume that the parties would have done research as to AID and parenting.<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.012"/> How about the ignorant individual who is unaware of the legal consequences attached to sperm donation? </s>
<s n="s16.17;p4.12">One view may be that his ignorance should not be held to negate his legal responsibilities since there is opportunity to discover the legal facts. </s>
<s n="s17.17;p4.12">Contrast this with the recent case of <hi rend="italic">B v A and others</hi> (2006)<ref target="BAWE_0312c-ftnote.013"/> where a sperm donor; the legal parent was quite aware of the legal consequences. </s>
