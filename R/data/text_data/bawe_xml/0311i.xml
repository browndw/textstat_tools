<p n="p2.102">
<s n="s1.4;p2.102">Borate glasses have been well studied over the past decade and there has been much research into their structure and spectra. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.102">This interest is partly because of the anomalous behaviour of the glass in that it forms superstructural units: well defined arrangements of the basic BO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> and BO <hi rend="sub">4</hi> structures (Fig. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.102">1) [1]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.102">BO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> forms a planar triangle whereas BO <hi rend="sub">4</hi> has a tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen around the boron atom. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.102">
<s n="s1.3;p3.102">Borates participate in the formation of borosilicate glasses that are used to immobilise high level nuclear waste for long-term storage. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p3.102">The existence of superstructural units in these glasses could have important consequences on the final structure of the nuclear waste glass, so it is worthwhile investigating the superstructural groups of simpler binary borate glasses. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p3.102">Evidence for the existence of the intermediate range order in borates, which does not occur in other glasses, are the sharp lines witnessed in Raman spectra corresponding to the breathing mode of the boroxol, and triborate, groups [2,3]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.102">
<s n="s1.5;p4.102">Pure B <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O <hi rend="sub">3</hi> forms a glass by itself and forms binary borates with many oxides. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.102">While pure B <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O <hi rend="sub">3</hi> only consists of 3-coordinated 'B3' boron at standard pressure, the addition of cations makes boron structures containing 'B4' possible. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.102">This is basically because it is more energetically favourable to form BO <hi rend="sub">4</hi> tetrahedra than break B-O-B bridges and leave a non-bridging oxygen. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.102">This is discussed in detail by Wright, Vedishcheva and Shakhmatkin [1]. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.102">This special behaviour gives borate glasses the ability to form superstructural units, some of which are shown in figure 1. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.102">Hence, pure B <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O <hi rend="sub">3</hi> has an N4 fraction of zero and a hypothetical borate glass consisting of nothing but diborate units would have an N4 fraction of 50%. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.102">The proportion of 4-coordinated boron is detectable by, amongst other means, Raman spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.102">The most extensive study on lithium borates was performed by Jellison, Feller and Bray in 1978 [4]. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.102">They showed the N4 fraction peaking at around 40 mol% Li <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O with a proportion of approximately 0.45 B4 to 0.55 B3. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.102">
<s n="s1.4;p8.102">A primary aim of this project is to correlate the N4 fraction given by NMR spectroscopy to that given by Raman spectroscopy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p8.102">This is worthwhile as various radioactive elements that would be present in the nuclear waste glass, such as uranium and its oxides, are paramagnetic, which prevents NMR spectroscopy being performed when these species are in high abundance. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p8.102">However, Raman spectroscopy does not depend on the magnetic susceptibility of the sample. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p8.102">By correlating the two techniques the N4 fraction can be found from the Raman spectrum of a glass containing too much paramagnetism to be analysed with NMR. Although Raman scattering produces a spectrum unaffected by magnetisation of the sample, the spectrum is significantly harder to interpret in terms of N4 fraction than an NMR spectrum. </s>

<p n="p9.102">
<s n="s1.3;p9.102">One of the seminal papers in the field of Raman spectroscopy of borate glasses is by Konijnendijk and Stevels (1975), and offers insight into which peaks correspond to which superstructural units in borate glasses [5]. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.102">Another key study into superstructural unit peak assignment was performed by Kamitsos, Karakassides and Chryssikos (1989), in which they concentrated on caesium, rubidium and potassium binary borates [6]. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.102">Meera and Ramakrishna also contributed to the peak assignment debate in 1991 discussing a wide range of borate glasses [2]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.102">
<s n="s1.3;p10.102">Densities and structural models for various alkali borates, including lithium and caesium, were investigated by Royle et al. [7]. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.102">Neutron diffraction studies of caesium borate glasses performed by Shaw et al. have provided further information about the role of superstructural units in vitreous B <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O <hi rend="sub">3</hi> and borate glasses [8]. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.102">Massot, Souto and Balkanski have tested borate glasses with Raman and light scattering spectroscopy as well as acoustic wave velocity and glass density measurements to help describe the short and medium range order [9]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.102">
<s n="s1.6;p11.102">NMR spectroscopy is very useful in the study of borate glasses as it can clearly distinguish between the two chemically distinct B3 and B4 sites and quantify the proportion of each. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p11.102">In 1993 Wüllen and Müller-Warmuth showed that magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR was a reliable method to do this in both theory and experiment [10]. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p11.102">However, as boron-11 is a quadrupolar species, this single-quantum method contained second order anisotropies. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p11.102">Amoureux, Fernandez and Frydman showed how to optimise an earlier multiple quantum experiment on half-integer quadrupoles that would remove these anisotropies [11]. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p11.102">This led to a study of the short range order in B <hi rend="sub">2</hi>O <hi rend="sub">3</hi> by Hwang et al. [12]. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p11.102">A helpful communication on the theory of multiple-quantum magic-angle spinning (MQMAS) containing further optimisation methods is provided by Brown and Wimperis [13]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.102">
<s n="s1.5;p12.102">Using 3QMAS-NMR Stebbins, Zhao and Kroeker have directly measured the concentrations of non-bridging oxygens in borate glasses [14]. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p12.102">Kroeker has also related the B4 sites in caesium borate glasses to superstructural units using MAS-NMR [15]. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p12.102">The proportion of B4 in the borate glass as alkali modifier content is varied has been explored, again using MAS-NMR, by Clarida et al. [16]. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p12.102">Du and Stebbins have examined, using 3QMAS-NMR, the connectivities within borate glasses and shown that there are boroxol rings [17]. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p12.102">Further studies on the NMR response of boroxol rings were performed by Zwanziger in 2004 [18]. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.102">
<s n="s1.1;p13.102">Alkali-borate glasses are still actively studied by many groups around the world and while there is now a great amount of knowledge about these glasses, there are still many unanswered questions about them and interesting research to perform on them. </s>

<s n="s2.5;p14.102">Glasses also exhibit time-dependent behaviour during formation; their final enthalpy will depend on their rate of cooling, which is not the case for crystals. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p14.102">Generally, on cooling a liquid below its melting point it can suddenly order itself causing a sharp drop in enthalpy, or it can remain disordered and become a supercooled liquid. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p14.102">In the latter case, as temperature continues to drop the viscosity of the liquid will rise until the rearrangement of atoms ceases, leaving a disordered solid. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p97.102">If convincing systematic variation was detected, there would still be the issue of which superstructural group was actually causing it. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p97.102">Debate still goes on about which units are really present in borate glasses and crystals. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p97.102">Contrary to theory proposed by Kerner the Raman spectra can be interpreted without tetraborate and still produce likely N4 fractions [19]. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p97.102">A definite list of peak assignments in borate glasses would be ideal, but for now the best practice is to focus on the systematic variation of area and make an informed estimate. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p97.102">It is important to remain rigorous and systematic, across compositions, for the peak assignments to give reliable N4 fractions. </s>
</p>
<p n="p98.102">
<s n="s1.6;p98.102">Whilst the N4 fractions given by Raman are uncertain, the error is much less for the N4 fractions given by NMR, as the B3 and B4 sites are so easily distinguishable by the NMR technique. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p98.102">The ability for the high-field 1D MAS experiment to confidently report the N4 fraction is remarkable. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p98.102">Figure 13 shows the NMR N4 fraction to be in very good agreement, up to <hi rend="italic">x</hi>=30, with the theoretical model. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p98.102">It should be noted, however, that each data point from <hi rend="italic">x</hi>=5 to <hi rend="italic">x</hi>=25 is slightly above what is predicted by the theory. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p98.102">This systematic positive deviation could be due to the 1.04 multiplier for the B3 peak area not being large enough. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p98.102">Calculations suggest this correction should be nearer to 1.13 times the B3 area to match the data to the model. </s>
</p>
<p n="p99.102">
<s n="s1.6;p99.102">The 2D MQMAS experiment suffered some failings. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p99.102">The lack of power to the probe is a significant, but easily remedied, problem. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p99.102">The difficulties in optimising the length of the pulses experimentally could be avoided by using theory to calculate the optimal lengths instead. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p99.102">As noise is an issue with the MQMAS experiment a modern receiver on the spectrometer would reduce this and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p99.102">Although it is interesting to observe how the symmetric and asymmetric quadrupolar lines fit into the broad B3-site peak, this is not necessary for finding the total N4 fraction. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p99.102">The B3 peak was fitted with two lines for the calculations, but it was shown that a distribution of quadrupolar lines with η=0 can be made to fit the peak just as well. </s>
</p>
<p n="p100.102">
<s n="s1.4;p100.102">As NMR is sensitive to the local structural environment of the nucleus it is probing it might be possible to see if the cobalt atoms changed the structure significantly when substituted for the di-lithium atoms, if the cobalt oxide was not paramagnetic and caused the spectra to broaden. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p100.102">The reason paramagnetic species cause the NMR spectrum to broaden is because they provide a larger spread of magnetic fields within the sample and hence cause a large variation in precession frequency. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p100.102">The task of understanding the properties of borate glasses as they are doped with paramagnetic species is an important one as, ultimately, the nuclear waste glass will contain significant numbers of paramagnetic species of all sizes. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p100.102">It is important that the Raman to NMR calibration holds for all similar structures if it is to be of practical use. </s>
</p>
<p n="p101.102">
<s n="s1.6;p101.102">To further improve the calibration more data points should be collected. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p101.102">The closer together the compositions the finer the systematic variation of superstructural groups will appear in the Raman spectra. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p101.102">This would further restrict the choice of superstructural groups and hopefully lead to an accurate peak assignment. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p101.102">Making compositions greater than the <hi rend="italic">x</hi>=40 studied here would further refine the calibration. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p101.102">Making glasses of high lithium content will require very fast cooling to prevent devitrification, such as roller quenching. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p101.102">It is important that the calibration can ultimately work for all feasible values of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p102.102">Calibrating the Raman results to the NMR results gives a linear fit of N4 <hi rend="sub">Raman</hi> = 0.87 (±0.18) N4 <hi rend="sub">NMR</hi> + 0.035 (± 0.056). </s>
<s n="s3.8;p102.102">This calibration is suitable over the range covered, but is deemed less reliable at the higher compositions due to potential errors in the baseline subtractions and superstructural group peak assignments. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p102.102">The methods used have been shown to provide accurate and repeatable results. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p102.102">There should be continued research into the superstructural units present in borate glasses at higher compositions, as well as with different alkali modifiers. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p102.102">A rigorous and systematic study of the Raman peaks and their superstructural group assignments would be paramount for any future study hoping to provide an accurate N4 fraction measurement. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p102.102">Studies like this are vital for the endeavour of characterising nuclear waste glass. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p102.102">It is conceived that, one day, nuclear waste glass will be probed on-site, using portable Raman spectroscopy, and an accurate value for the N4 fraction given with a high degree of certainty. </s>
