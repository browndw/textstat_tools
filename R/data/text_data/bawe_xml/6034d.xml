<s n="s1.3;p1.31">The EU's readiness to eliminate export subsidies by 2014, declared at the 6 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ministerial WTO conference in Hong Kong at the end of last year, released torrents of speculations on its impact on the future shape of the Common Agricultural Policy. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.31">However, as the details on modalities are yet to be agreed and the only piece of information available is 'the date', the accuracy of conjectures may be limited just like the scope of the following analysis. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.31">It focuses solely on the potential impact of export subsidy abolition on the European dairy policy - the last bastion of the old-style CAP. By this example it argues, that the progressing WTO negotiations do and will have a measurable effect on the evolution of the agricultural policy of the European Union. </s>

<p n="p2.31">
<s n="s1.2;p2.31">The essay is organised as follows: section 2 presents shortly the nature of export subsidies as an inherent aspect of the CAP, then section 3 follows with a brief overview of the history of the WTO negotiations that have step-by-step led to the current explicit declarations of export refund abolition. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.31">Section 4 focuses on the nature of the European dairy policy, while section 5 contains the summary of the opinions on the expected changes this policy will undergo, if the agreement on export refunds happens to be binding. </s>
