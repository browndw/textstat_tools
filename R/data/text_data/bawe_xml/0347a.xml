<s n="s1.1;p4.80">It was identified that the Brass sample had been strengthened from heat treatment and fast cooling, whereas the steel was identified as malleable, having been heat treated and slowly cooled. </s>

<p n="p5.80">
<s n="s1.2;p5.80">From the SEM images, it could be seen that HAP on it's own was brittle, and the PE was flexible. </s>

<p n="p9.80">
<s n="s1.2;p9.80">Microstructure Analysis is used for examining materials on a granular and crystalline level. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p9.80">This can help in determining failure patterns, so particular characteristics can be investigated before a material is selected for a specific purpose, such as the components of a hip replacement. </s>

<head rend="bold">2.2.a Optical Microscope</head>
<p n="p10.80">
<s n="s1.5;p10.80">The Optical Microscope is one of the more basic instruments used in material analysis. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p10.80">It works using a complex set-up of lenses, and a light source, all accurately manufactured, so that a flat sample can be magnified to a degree that cannot be seen with the unaided eye. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p10.80">This means that we are talking about magnifications of up to 100 or 200. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p10.80">In the case of this laboratory, the microscope is in stereo, which provides a three-dimensional image of the surface of the sample. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p10.80">This is important because with higher magnifications, the image has greater boundaries for distortion, and so to achieve worthwhile results, we must use a high powered microscope. </s>

<p n="p11.80">
<s n="s1.2;p11.80">This instrument was developed around 1935, but not perfected until the late 50s. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.80">It works on a similar principle to the Optical Microscope, except that instead of using light as a medium, thermionically emitted electrons are fired at the surface of the sample, and the image is formed when these are reflected, and detected by a scintillator-photomultiplier device, and converted into a digital image. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.80">
<s n="s1.2;p12.80">Resolutions of between 1nm and 20nm can be obtained by this scanning process, so magnifications of over 1000 are entirely possible, and can create very accurate images. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p12.80">It is a time consuming process, however, as the sample must be treated before it is scanned, and can prove to be very expensive. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p13.80">The results are given as a graph, of Intensity (counts) and values for 2-theta. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.80">It works by emitting x-rays at measured angles, and the peaks on the graphs are where most of the x-rays are deflected. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.80">Thus the crystal size, purity and texture can be determined by the output of the peaks.(<seg type="URL" n="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography"/>) </s>

<p n="p14.80">
<s n="s1.1;p14.80">The formula : n = 2d sinBraggs Law, Shackleford) is used within the program on the PC directly connected to the machine, to produce the graphical presentations of the results. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.80">
<s n="s1.2;p15.80">X-Rays of a particular wavelength are emitted (and this is accurately produced because a voltage is applied to Copper elements, which are forced to release photons of energy from their inner energy shells), and fired at the sample, which is then reflected the most when the wavelength is in phase with the crystals. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p38.80">Brass contains both Copper, Zinc, and Traces of Tin, which explains the three different components of the image: the light grains; dark grains; and dark spots. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p38.80">The matrix is more closely packed, which implies strength, but does not prove that the specimen is malleable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p38.80">It also suggests that the metal was cooled quickly, because the grains are small (0.005-0.02mm in diameter), and the range is small(0.0015), which suggests that it was cooled uniformly.(the Brass was in fact hot extruded and then annealed, which supports my discussion) </s>

<s n="s2.6;p39.80">Steel contains Iron and Carbon. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p39.80">It is normally high in strength, which can be seen as the large grains are closely packed. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p39.80">However, there are big matrix gaps, suggesting malleability. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p39.80">We can tell that this has been heat treated, as the grains are large(0.01-0.03mm) so it was cooled slowly to allow these to form. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p39.80">The range of these values is larger than the brass(0.02), which could suggest that it was cooled irregularly, although whether this was in air or some other medium, is unclear.

<s n="s1.3;p47.80">Porous HAP Biocomposite - this has well distributed, regular pores. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p47.80">The range between the diameters is roughly 160μm, however, most of the pores are between 40μm and 70μm in diameter. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p47.80">The magnification is 37.2x, which isn't very high, so none of the granular structure can be identified. </s>
</p>
<p n="p48.80">
<s n="s1.2;p48.80">Cortical Bone - this seems to be formed by layers of composite, and so the diameters between the layers are not dissimilar from each other (37.74μm, 28.30μm). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p48.80">This also means that tiny pores can just be seen between the layers, however, the magnification is only 18.7x, therefore these pores cannot be analysed, because the resolution is not high enough. </s>
</p>
<p n="p49.80">
<s n="s1.4;p49.80">Cancellous Bone - this is a strange material, which is found within the central cavity of a bone. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p49.80">It is porous and "lumpy", so that movement of particles can take place. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p49.80">It also provides the internal structure and cushioning strength of the bone, so the pores are very small, with a range of 0.1μm-0.2μm, and this is fairly consistent. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p49.80">The magnification for this image is 8020x, so the resolution is very good, and we can tell that the structure is regular throughout. </s>
</p>
<p n="p50.80">
<s n="s1.4;p50.80">PE Particles - the particles of the PE are clearly defined as separate bodies to the medium they are presented on. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p50.80">Of varying sizes (height and width, ranging from ~50μm to ~250μm and ~35μm to ~115μm) </s>
<s n="s3.4;p50.80">This suggests no real strength or interaction between the particles. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p51.80">HAP Particles - these "sharp" particles are definitely a ceramic, as you can see the definite edges. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p51.80">This implies that the material will be brittle. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p51.80">There are many particles overlaying each other, so strength is a feature of the sample, but easy to fracture. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p51.80">The particles come in three sizes really - those ranging from 5-10μm; 11-30μm and 40μm+. </s>
</p>
<p n="p52.80">
<s n="s1.2;p52.80">PE Surface - this looks like quite a flat sample, where all of the grains are "glued" together in a matrix. </s>

<s n="s3.5;p53.80">They are irregular formations, of various cluster diameters. </s>

<p n="p55.80">
<s n="s1.2;p55.80">For these measurements, there are definite inaccuracies inherent within the testing equipment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p55.80">Although the magnification may be very high, and the resolution is very good, the figures provided by the PC program are limited by: the resolution of the cursor; the human error created when selecting the measurements; the resolution of the computer screen; amongst others. </s>
</p>
<p n="p56.80">
<s n="s1.2;p56.80">Where the same result has occurred more than once, this is an indication that there are limitations in the equipment. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p56.80">This has happened, for example, in the cortical bone specimen. </s>
</p>
<p n="p57.80">
<s rend="bold" n="s1.1;p57.80">In occasions such as this, I would suggest that another sample be taken at higher magnification, which could improve the resolution of the image. </s>

<s n="s1.2;p60.80">All of this can tell us that not only do the two substances within the final material (PEHAp) not "fuse" together, and maintain their individual crystalline structures, but it also tells us that the qualities from both products combine to make the biocomposite. </s>

<s n="s2.3;p64.80">The matrix is more closely packed, which implies strength, but does not prove that the specimen is malleable. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p64.80">It also suggests that the metal was cooled quickly, because the grains are small (0.005-0.02mm in diameter), and the range is small(0.0015), which suggests that it was cooled uniformly. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p66.80">It is normally high in strength, which can be seen as the large grains are closely packed. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p66.80">However, there are big matrix gaps, suggesting malleability. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p66.80">We can tell that this has been heat treated, as the grains are large(0.01-0.03mm) so it was cooled slowly to allow these to form. </s>
