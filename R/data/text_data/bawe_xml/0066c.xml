<s n="s1.4;p1.15">Vince, an employee working at a building site operated by BloggsBuild Limited, died after falling from the third story of scaffolding. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.15">His death can be attributed to manslaughter by gross negligence on the part of individuals or organization to maintain a safe working environment. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.15">The facts of the case indicate that Mr. Bloggs, Managing Director and majority shareholder of BloggsBuild Limited, visited the site only occasionally. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.15">Malcolm, the site manager, took all decisions regarding the site and permitted Colin, a dangerous driver, to operate the crane- the immediate cause of Vince's death. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.15">
<s n="s1.4;p2.15">Recklessness has been replaced by 'gross negligence' as the mens rea required for manslaughter following the decision of <hi rend="italic">Adomako</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.001"/> supported by previous precedents of <hi rend="italic">Bateman</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.002"/> and <hi rend="italic">Andrews</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.003"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.15">It identified that once breach of duty is established, the jury must go on to consider whether the defendant's breach caused the death of the victim and whether the conduct was of such seriousness that placed the life or health at risk, to amount to gross negligence given the circumstances.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.004"/> A jury may take into account the degree of harm risked and the defendant's 'state of mind' when dealing with cases of manslaughter by gross negligence<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.15">Against this background, one can consider Malcolm liable since his conduct maybe seen as the main cause of Vince's death and may be serious enough to establish gross negligence manslaughter. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.15">However, the principle of fair labeling is concerned to see that distinctions between kinds of offences and degrees of wrongdoing are respected and punished proportionately.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.006"/> This essay will not only consider liability for the death between Sid, Colin, Malcolm, Mr. Bloggs and BloggsBuild Limited under the current law, but will also evaluate the effect of the proposed changes in the field of corporate liability, although, the decision in the case rests with the Jury. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.15">Sid was in charge of erecting the scaffolding and could be culpable for unsafe construction without enough clamps for stability. </s>

<head rend="bold">Colin</head>
<p n="p4.15">
<s n="s1.9;p4.15">The immediate cause of Vince's death was when Colin, a 19-year-old apprentice carpenter, had swung the jib of the crane into the partially collapsed scaffolding. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p4.15">Since the crane driver had not arrived for work, Colin volunteered to operate the crane due to 'urgent need'. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p4.15">Malcolm had agreed without checking his credentials regarding experience with operating crane and had previously ignored reports by other workers voicing concerns about his dangerous and unpredictable operating. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p4.15">It may be argued, 'unqualified practitioner cannot claim to be measured by any lower standard than that which is applied to a qualified man'.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.007"/> Colin's offer to operate the crane bestows a responsibility and caution expected of a professional operator and thus may be liable for its consequence, making him the factual cause of Vince's death under Constructive Manslaughter (Unlawful and Dangerous Act Manslaughter). </s>
<s n="s5.9;p4.15">Given Colin's history and inexperience in operating cranes, his act can be described as unlawful. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p4.15">The fact, he drove the crane dangerously into the scaffolding causing it to fully collapse and resulting in the death of the victim satisfies the mens rea of dangerousness based on the objective reasonable man set out in the cases of <hi rend="italic">Andrews</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.008"/>. </s>
<s n="s7.9;p4.15">While Colin may be liable for the death of the victim, his defense lies in the fact that Malcolm should have checked his credentials and qualification to operate the crane and also taken seriously the warnings given to him regarding Colin's reckless operation. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p4.15">He may also argue that he was only doing a favor and there is no legal authority to prove that his act was unlawful. </s>

<head rend="bold">Malcolm</head>
<p n="p5.15">
<s n="s1.4;p5.15">Malcolm as site manager was under a contract with BloggsBuild Limited responsible for most of the decisions regarding the site and maintaining a safe working environment. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p5.15">He, therefore, should have known what is expected of a man of his position just as <hi rend="italic">Adomako</hi> should have fulfilled the expectations of a reasonable anesthetist in his position and circumstances.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.009"/> Malcolm seemed to lack adequate definition of responsibility and overall supervision focusing on 'getting the job done' and pushing the issue of safety into the background with regard to Sid and Colin resulting in the death of Vince, thereby falling below the standards expected of a reasonable professional. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p5.15">He disregarded the health and welfare of the workers for whom he was responsible, placing them at a high risk and should be guilty under the principles set out in <hi rend="italic">Stone &amp; Dobinson</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.010"/> where the defendants were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p5.15">Thus, it seems clear that Malcolm's conduct or omission satisfies the criteria in <hi rend="italic">Adomako</hi> supported by <hi rend="italic">Bateman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Andrews</hi>, which state that a high degree of disregard for the life and safety of others (<hi rend="italic">Bateman</hi>) is required to establish manslaughter by gross negligence. </s>

<s n="s1.12;p6.15">Malcolm for his defense can argue that Colin's negligent operation of crane breaks the chain of causation. </s>

<s n="s3.12;p6.15">Malcolm, despite the busy nature of his work, should have checked Colin's experience and qualification with regard to cranes. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p6.15">Thus this defense, while shifting some of the blame to Colin, does not absolve Malcolm of liability. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p6.15">Secondly, one can argue that the jury should have taken into account the defendant's 'state of mind'. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p6.15">However, as stated by Rose LJ in <hi rend="italic">AG Ref.</hi> </s>
<s rend="italic" n="s7.12;p6.15">No. </s>

<hi rend="italic">2 (1999)</hi>
<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.011"/>, evidence regarding 'state of mind' is not a prerequisite to establish liability for gross negligence manslaughter. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p6.15">In addition, if a consequence is foreseeable, as should have been to any man in Malcolm's position, then even a mere negligent act may be seen as grossly negligent.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.012"/> English Law does not impose liability for omissions; however, this does not apply to Malcolm as he falls under one of the special category, i.e. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p6.15">'Contractual Duty'.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.013"/> Thus, the best argument is to associate Malcolm with BloggsBuild Limited based on <hi rend="italic">Meridian</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.014"/> It was ruled by the <hi rend="italic">Privy Council</hi> that the employees could be identified with the company as its 'mind and will' because they were best placed to make the deal. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p6.15">If this flexible approach is adopted then Malcolm will be best placed with regard to the site and his decisions would be considered the 'mind and will'<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.015"/> of BloggsBuild Limited. </s>

<s n="s2.6;p12.15">237.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.033"/> Under the proposals, the separate offence of 'Corporate killing' and 'Substantial Contribution to Corporate killing' should replace the 'identification' doctrine.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.034"/> This broadens the scope of corporate criminal liability and a corporation is liable if management failure (mens rea) to maintain health and safety of employees or people affected results in death, falling 'below the standards' expected.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.035"/> It is not essential that (1) the defendant corporation foresees or appreciates the likelihood of risk and (2) the immediate cause of death is the act or omission of an individual.<ref target="BAWE_0066c-ftnote.036"/> The focus is on general practice of organization rather than actions of an identifiable person. </s>
