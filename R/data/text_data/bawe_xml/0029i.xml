<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.001"/>
<s n="s3.11;p1.27">The extent to which Luther was responsible for this 'great religious upheaval' must be investigated. </s>
<s n="s4.11;p1.27">The issue of Martin Luther's importance to the Reformation has been a much discussed and heated topic among historians, particularly in the context of the movement's early years. </s>
<s n="s5.11;p1.27">The essay will analyse the impact that Luther's personality and ideas actually had on the Reformation in Germany by examining his theses and the effect they had on the German people. </s>
<s n="s6.11;p1.27">It will also examine the means by which his ideas were disseminated and the significance this had on determining the overall success of the Reformation. </s>
<s n="s7.11;p1.27">Also important is what can actually be considered to be the <hi rend="italic">early Reformation</hi> and whether, in fact, the movement had stages as such. </s>
<s n="s8.11;p1.27">Many historians, such as the Catholic Church historian Joseph Lortz, have also sought to downplay Luther's influence by promoting the idea that conditions in Germany were already ripe for Reformation due to anticlericalism and a general religious malaise, as well as the influence of the humanists who, Lortz argues, laid the groundwork for the Reformation and, therefore, for the reception of Luther's ideas. </s>
<s n="s9.11;p1.27">This particular argument will be examined in trying to answer the question. </s>
<s n="s10.11;p1.27">There were also a large number of vital figures to which the Reformation owed a great deal such as other Protestant reformers including Ulrich Zwingli, Andreas Karlstadt and Thomas Müntzer. </s>
<s n="s11.11;p1.27">Ultimately, however, one man did stand above all others in helping to initiate the Reformation and contribute to its early success - Martin Luther. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p2.27">The first and most important question to be posed in relation to formulating an answer is determining what actually constituted the early Reformation. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p2.27">The result will have significant bearing on answering the overall question. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p2.27">The problem of what represented the early Reformation has itself been long examined by historians. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p2.27">There is a general acceptance that the Reformation began in 1517 when Martin Luther's dispute over the selling of indulgences occurred and the Ninety-five Theses were produced in October. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p2.27">However, the end of the so called first phase of the Reformation is much disputed - many historians argue that it was marked by the end of the unsuccessful Peasants' War in 1525, while a number of others take the Marburg Colloquy of 1529 to signify the end of the early Reformation. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p2.27">Some dispute the fact that the Reformation had phases at all and instead argue that it can be fit into a wider context of religious change beginning in the fifteenth century and lasting far beyond the peace of Augsburg in 1555. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.27">
<s n="s1.6;p3.27">In discussing the Peasants' War, A.G. Dickens comes to the conclusion that, 'The first phase of the German Reformation thus ended in an atmosphere dramatically different from that of its inception with the Ninety-five Theses." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.002"/>
<s n="s2.6;p3.27">This indicates that he believes the Peasants' War to mark the end of the early Reformation. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.27">Lortz's interpretation of the early Reformation is more clouded. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.27">He argues that Luther supplied 'the most essential nourishment... in its earliest years. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.27">This does not mean that the Luther of the second half of the twenties, and of the thirties and forties had nothing more of importance to say'.<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.003"/> Although this helps to shape an argument for when Luther was most significant to the Reformation movement, it does not specifically state when he believes the first phase of the Reformation to have ended. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.27">The Protestant church historian Dorothea Wendebourg calls into question whether there was an 'early phase' of the Reformation as she maintains that it is hard to determine when the movement actually began. <ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.004"/> </s>

<s n="s1.5;p4.27">However, this essay will argue that the early Reformation can be defined as the period from the issuing of the Ninety-five theses, when Luther was in outright public opposition to the Catholic Church for the first time, until the Peasants' War, which was defeated in 1525. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.27">The reason for the staring point of the period is obvious, as stated above, but the end was chosen because after the Peasants' War, the Protestant movement fragmented significantly around different leaders; thus entering a new phase of the Reformation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.27">It was precisely because Luther initiated the movement in the first place, that the period where he was no longer in complete control must be seen as a break with the initial phase. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.27">Thus, this essay will use the Peasants' War to mark the end of the early Reformation in Germany. </s>

<p n="p5.27">
<s n="s1.5;p5.27">Some historians, such as the aforementioned Lortz, have sought to undermine the influence of Martin Luther by emphasizing that the situation in Germany was already unstable and that people sought reform - there was a 'mighty antipapal movement [in]... the late Middle Ages'.<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.005"/> He argues that Luther was the prime beneficiary of the radical changes of this period, because the people merely needed a leader. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p5.27">He stresses that the demand for reform had become violent by the sixteenth century and an intense anticlericalism was held by the majority of the population. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p5.27">There was, in general, an enormous increase in church criticism and indifference to religion as indicated by increasing 'Absence from confession, irregular reception of the Eucharist, mechanical performance of religious activities, drift toward religious indifference [and] experimentation with new religious forms by devout people'.<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.006"/> Complaints directed against the clergy commonly included their freedom from taxation, indulgence traffic and the selling of basic religious services. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p5.27">Lortz did acknowledge, though, that this hatred and apathy was partially due to the failure of the Catholic Church itself. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p5.27">In general, therefore, Luther 'was certainly not the first... to criticize the use of indulgences, the immorality of the clergy, and bad preaching'.<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.007"/> </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.009"/>
<s n="s4.9;p6.27">A German identity was fostered by scholars and literary men such as Ulrich von Hutten and Erasmus who were considered crucial in preparing Germany for the Reformation movement from which Luther was able to take advantage. </s>

<s n="s8.9;p6.27">An example of this is that Luther increasingly referred to the Pope as the Antichrist as the Reformation progressed, but this idea had already become very popular in the previous century among the humanists. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p7.27">However, while the effect of both the humanists and anticlericalism within Germany were important in helping to create the conditions from which the Reformation was able to flourish, it is vital not to over exaggerate their influence. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.27">The nineteenth-century Catholic Church historian Johannes Janssen argues that 'the half century before the Reformation [was]... one of the most spiritually sound and profound periods of German history'.<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.013"/> Clearly, this can be seen as a vast exaggeration as it is in direct contrast with the evidence examined thus far, but the fact that Janssen is willing to make such an extreme argument indicates that anticlericalism in Germany was probably not found on such a wide scale as other historians have claimed and that it varied regionally. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.27">The most realistic explanation in determining the degree of anticlericalism and the effects of humanism on the Reformation can be seen in the argument of Moeller. </s>

<s n="s1.9;p24.27">Two of the most famous examples of Protestantism being accepted into large urban centres were with Strasbourg and Nuremberg. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p24.27">In both cities, it was the pressure from below, particularly from the lower and middle classes that forced the implementation of the Reformation, especially in the years 1524-1525. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p24.27">New Evangelical ideas of salvation were imposed upon the populations by Lutheran preachers. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p24.27">The city councils had to bow to demand and the Reformation was soon imposed in at least 50 out of 65 imperial cities according to Moeller.<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.046"/> The Reformation was undoubtedly an urban event. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p24.27">Indeed, C. Scott Dixon states that, 'From the very outset, a relationship existed between the evangelical movement and the urban culture." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.047"/>
<s n="s6.9;p24.27">This was because of the cities' social structures and class struggles, as well as their long standing anticlericalism and relatively high literacy levels - 'Reformers found fertile soil for their ideas in urban anticlerical and antimonopolistic mercantile sentiment." </s>

<s n="s7.9;p24.27">Once these new religious beliefs had established themselves in a self-governing walled town, it was impossible to wipe them out. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p24.27">They were accepted by virtually everyone and the Reformation became a democratic revolution. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p24.27">Luther's ideas changed late medieval religion in the most fundamental way. </s>

<s n="s4.5;p26.27">Perhaps most telling of all is Scott H.

<s n="s1.6;p27.27">Therefore, in conclusion, the early Reformation in Germany owed a great deal to Martin Luther's personality and ideas. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p27.27">Despite the influence of humanism in the previous decade in creating anticlericalism and a national German sentiment, and the effect of other reformers on the Reformation, Luther was undeniably the single most important figure in its early stages. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p27.27">Although one could argue that without the widespread dissemination of his views, the Reformation would have been less likely to have survived, it is clear that without his theses it would not have even been born at all. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p27.27">Thus, Luther was hugely important in both initiating the Reformation and maintaining it in its infancy, both in terms of his ideas which had great resonance for the German people, and with his personality - especially the deliverance of his speeches which made him such an attractive leader. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p27.27">It is important to remember that it was purely because the nation's response to Luther was so intense, that he was forced to lead the movement - 'We know how Luther's words spread over the country with astonishing speed, how people seized upon them as if this was just what they had been waiting for." </s>
<ref target="BAWE_0029i-ftnote.053"/>
<s n="s6.6;p27.27">Without Luther's ideas and the subsequent response, the Reformation would never even have occurred. </s>
