<head>Renold PLC Company Overview</head>
<quote lang="English">"Renold plc is an international engineering group, producing a wide range of precision engineering products, operating in eighteen countries worldwide. The principal activities of the Group are the manufacture and sale of industrial chains and related power transmission products, automotive cam drive systems and specialist machine tools and rotors."

<head>Evaluation of plc's past performance from the perspective of an ordinary shareholder.</head>
<p n="p4.105">
<s n="s1.1;p4.105">In order to analyse Renold PLC's past performance, ten performance indicators have been chosen that best illustrate how the company has achieved in the past year, and have then been related to a shareholder's position. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.105">
<s n="s1.1;p5.105">The performance indicators chosen are: </s>
</p>
<list type="simple">
<item>Profitability Ratios: ROSE (Return on Shareholder's Equity, ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)</item>
<item>Liquidity Ratios: Current Assets Ratio, Acid Test Ratio</item>
<item>Efficiency Ratios: Fixed Asset Turnover, Trade Debtor Collection Period Ratio</item>
<item>Investment Ratios: Dividend Yield, Dividend Cover, EPS (Earnings Per Share), Gearing</item>
</list>
<p n="p6.105">
<s n="s1.4;p6.105">In the following financial ratios, either data from the Annual Financial Report or the FAME database have been used. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p6.105">In some of the cases these calculated values have been compared to ratios released by the FAME database. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p6.105">The purpose of this is to illustrate the variation that can occur in financial ratio calculation. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p6.105">This is due to the fact that different companies and countries use different variations of the same formulae, as a matter of preference or financial standards. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>ROSE</head>
<p n="p7.105">
<s n="s1.1;p7.105">ROSE, according to the Business Development Bank of Canada "measures the rate of return the shareholders receive on their investment". </s>

</p>
<p n="p9.105">
<s n="s1.1;p9.105">ROSE can be calculated by finding the ratio between Net profit (loss) after tax and Ordinary Shareholder's Funds. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.105">
<s n="s1.1;p10.105">In the following graph there are two different lines, which is due to the fact that in 2004, Renold had to change the way it stated financial documents to include FRS17 regarding Pension Benefits. </s>

<head>Graph from Student ID <name type="student ID"/>

<p n="p11.105">
<s n="s1.3;p11.105">This graph shows a fluctuation throughout the years between 2001 and 2005, with a recent dropping to - 8.56% in 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.105">This negative value gives reason to the fact that no final dividends were paid in this financial year. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.105">However, it should be remembered that the Pension Deficit was added in this year due to FRS17, which would have influenced this result to a high extent. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.105">
<s n="s1.1;p12.105">This graph would appear to be a bad sign for a shareholder due to the fact that it shows an undesirable return on an investment. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>ROCE</head>
<p n="p13.105">
<s n="s1.2;p13.105">According to Karen Bradbury from the module Finance and Accounting at the University of Warwick and Dyson, "Return on capital employed measures the relationship between the amount invested in the business and the returns generated for the investors." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.105">It would therefore be desirable to have a percentage ratio that is larger than that which you would get in a bank account, which has none of the risk associated with businesses. </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.105">
<s n="s1.1;p14.105">The following graph was obtained using the equation: </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.105">
<s n="s1.1;p15.105">ROCE = [Profit before interest and taxation]/[Fixed Assets + Current Assets - Current Liabilities] x 100% </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.105">
<s n="s1.2;p16.105">The first two lines represent data from FAME using end of year, and average values respectively. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.105">The third line uses ROCE values from FAME, which uses a slightly different formula. </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0329g-fig.002">
<head>Graph from Student ID <name type="student ID"/>
</head>
</figure>
<p n="p17.105">
<s n="s1.3;p17.105">The graph shows that values for ROCE fluctuate considerably in the period of 2001 until 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p17.105">There is also a difference between the ratio from FAME and the calculated values, due to the different formulae that have been used. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p17.105">This indicates that it should be found out which formula has been used before analysing the results, before any false conclusions are made. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.105">
<s n="s1.3;p18.105">This graph indicates to a shareholder that they are not getting as much return from their investment as they have in previous years. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.105">The value is on average just over 5% for the calculated values and negative for the FAME values. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.105">This could raise concern because this same percentage could be obtained in a savings account. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Acid Test Ratio</head>
<p n="p19.105">
<s n="s1.1;p19.105">The Acid Test Ratio is calculated using the formula: </s>
</p>
<p n="p20.105">
<s n="s1.1;p20.105">[Current Assets - stocks] / Current Liabilities </s>
</p>
<p n="p21.105">
<s n="s1.1;p21.105">The purpose of the ratio is to see "what would happen to the current ratio if stocks were not included in the definition of current assets" (Dyson p 257), due to the fact that stocks cannot easily and quickly be turned into cash. </s>
</p>
<p n="p22.105">
<s n="s1.1;p22.105">Using data from the Profit and Loss Account in the Annual Report, the following graph can be obtained: </s>

<figure id="BAWE_0329g-fig.003">
<head>Graph from Student ID <name type="student ID"/>
</head>
</figure>
<p n="p23.105">
<s n="s1.3;p23.105">It can be seen that over the past 5 years, Renold's Acid Test Ratio has risen from 0.83 in 2001 to 1.02 in 2005. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p23.105">This is a good sign of improvement, due to the fact that the company will be able to fulfil any short-term commitments easily. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p23.105">However, it would not be desirable for this value to rise much higher, as it would indicate that the company's resources were not being used correctly. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Current Assets Ratio</head>
<p n="p24.105">
<s n="s1.2;p24.105">A current asset ratio is the ratio between Current Assets and Current Liabilities. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p24.105">A good explanation of the values that this ratio should be is given by the Student 0306547, which is in turn referenced from <seg type="URL" n="http://www.bized.ac.uk/learn/business/accounting/busaccounts/notes/clias-th.htm"/> </s>
</p>
<quote lang="English">"A firm needs enough assets to cover its liabilities, hence the result of the calculation should always be above 1. If the value is below 1 then the company is insolvent. A value of just over 1 means that they are struggling to meet their liabilities. A value between 1.5 and 2 is desirable. Whilst above 2 means the company is in a very safe position"</quote>
<p n="p25.105">
<s n="s1.1;p25.105">Data taken form the FAME database yields the following graph; </s>

<p n="p26.105">
<s n="s1.3;p26.105">This graph shows a fluctuating Current Assets ratio, from a minimum of 1.71 in 2001 to a maximum of 1.82 in 2004. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.105">Even though there seems to be a large drop from 2004 to 2005, it is still well within the range of data shown over the past five years, and is only a drop of around 0.1. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.105">The value for 2005 also takes into account pension liability, which would account for some of the drop. </s>
</p>
<p n="p27.105">
<s n="s1.1;p27.105">The value of 1.73 for Current Assets Ratio is within the desirable range of 1.5 to 2.0, meaning that it has "enough assets to cover its liabilities", without "too much money invested in assets." </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.105">
<s n="s1.1;p28.105">This would indicate to a shareholder that the company is in a fairly strong position at present. </s>
</p>
<p n="p29.105">
<s n="s1.4;p29.105">The current assets ratio of Renold can be compared to its major peer of Tsubakimoto Chain Group (<seg type="URL" n="http://tsubakimoto.com"/>) who produce power transmission chains, meaning that they are competing companies. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p29.105">Using the peer analysis option in FAME database, it can be seen that Tsubakimoto has a current assets ratio in 2005 of 1.13 compared to the value of 1.73 for Renold. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p29.105">This means that while Renold is able to cover its liabilities with relative ease, Tsubakimoto will be in a position where they will be struggling to meet the liabilities. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p29.105">Meaning that in terms of this ratio, Renold is in a stronger position than one of its competitors. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Fixed Asset Turnover</head>
<p n="p30.105">
<s n="s1.4;p30.105">Fixed asset turnover is according to 'Winning Business' by Rich Gildersleeve (1999, Gulf Professional Publishing, p136) "how many times a company achieves, or turns over the book value of fixed assets in net sales". </s>
<s n="s2.4;p30.105">The value that is obtained does not mean much in isolation, however when compared to previous years it can be very useful. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p30.105">It can be seen, according to Dyson (p259) that "if the trend is upwards, then the investment in fixed assets is beginning to pay off." </s>
<s n="s4.4;p30.105">This is a good sign for Renold, as shown by the following graph, using data from FAME; </s>
</p>
<figure id="BAWE_0329g-fig.005">
<head>Graph from Student ID <name type="student ID"/>
</head>
</figure>
<p n="p31.105">
<s n="s1.2;p31.105">As can be seen, the graph shows an increasing trend, year-on-year, apart from 2001 to 2002 where there is a slight dip. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p31.105">This increasing trend would indicate to a shareholder that the business' fixed assets of the company are being used effectively, and are producing a good amount of turnover as a result. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head>Trade Debtor Collection Period Ratio</head>
<p n="p32.105">
<s n="s1.3;p32.105">The Trade Debtor Collection Period Ratio is a ratio which indicates how long it is taking for debtors to pay. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p32.105">This is important to Renold, because if debtors are taking too long to pay, then cash flow may be affected. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p32.105">The following graph, using data from FAME database and the Annual Report shows the Trade Debtor Collection Period for Renold, using the formula: </s>
</p>
<p n="p33.105">
<s n="s1.1;p33.105">[[1/2*(opening trade debtors + closing trade debtors)]/Turnover] x 365 days </s>

<head>Graph from Student ID <name type="student ID"/>
</head>
</figure>
<p n="p34.105">
<s n="s1.4;p34.105">According to Dyson (p260), in the UK "the median debtor collection period is about 50 days". </s>
<s n="s2.4;p34.105">Whereas the time for Renold is fluctuating between 63 and 59 days, which is 2 weeks higher than that of an average company. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p34.105">This could represent that Renold is fairly weak at collecting its debts, which may mean that could run into trouble if the debts are not collected quickly enough. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p34.105">However, the high value could also mean that because of the industry in which Renold is operating, the time it takes to pay debts is longer. </s>
</p>
<p n="p35.105">
<s n="s1.2;p35.105">A shareholder should certainly be aware of this collection period, as an increase could be a bad sign. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p35.105">However, as it stands the time it takes to collect debt has decreased by 4 days in the past year, which could indicate a possible further decrease in the future. </s>

<div2>
<head>Dividend Yield</head>
<p n="p36.105">
<s n="s1.2;p36.105">According to Dyson (p261), "the dividend yield measures the rate of return that an investor gets by comparing the cost of his shares with the dividend receivable (or paid)". </s>
<s n="s2.2;p36.105">An investor would be interested in investing in a company that pays out a high amount of dividend per share, with a preferably increasing value. </s>
</p>
<p n="p37.105">
<s n="s1.2;p37.105">In the following graph the Dividend Yield has been calculated using the total dividends paid out during the year (taken from the Renold website), divided by the market share price (taken from FAME database.) </s>
<s n="s2.2;p37.105">Both the end and average values for years have been shown for comparative purposes. </s>

<p n="p38.105">
<s n="s1.4;p38.105">The graph above shows that over the past 5 years the Dividend Yield has decreased drastically from a value of about 10 to a value of 2. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p38.105">This is a bad sign for a shareholder in the company, due to the fact that every year they will be getting less money from dividends. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p38.105">In fact, the Annual Report for Renold states that no final dividend would be paid to shareholders in the financial year 2004/2005. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p38.105">The reason for this would be because the company reported a loss due to increased raw material prices, and so they would want to put the money that would have been used to pay dividends back into the company, in order to strengthen it. </s>

</div2>
<div2>
<head>Dividend Cover</head>
<p n="p39.105">
<s n="s1.2;p39.105">Dividend cover is described by Dyson (p261) as being "the number of times that the ordinary dividend could be paid out of current earnings." </s>
<s n="s2.2;p39.105">It therefore indicates how much profit will be left after the dividends have been paid. </s>
</p>
<p n="p40.105">
<s n="s1.1;p40.105">In the following graph the dividend cover has been calculated using data from both FAME and the Annual Report, in order to indicate any differences occurring due to the restating of 2004 figures that was done in order to make comparison to 2005 appropriate. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p43.105">Which is a fairly good, as the company has enough money to pay for its dividends. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p43.105">However, in 2002, and more recently 2005, the dividend cover has been negative, due to losses within the company. </s>
</p>
<p n="p44.105">
<s n="s1.2;p44.105">This can be considered as being a warning sign for potential shareholders, as in 2005 no final dividends were paid out. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p44.105">This means that shareholders would not have got a significant return on their investment. </s>

<s n="s1.1;p45.105">In the words of Dyson (p261), "EPS enables a fair comparison to be made between one year's earnings and another by relating the earnings to something tangible, i.e. the number of shares in issue." </s>

<s n="s2.2;p46.105">There is generally not much difference between these variations of EPS, however investopedia.com suggests that "Diluted EPS is a much more accurate reflection of a company's earnings" due to the fact that it takes "into account if all warrants, stock options, and convertible bonds were traded in for stock". </s>
