<s n="s2.6;p1.8">While some see this premise merely as a means for the West to propagate neo-liberal ideology, significant evidence suggests that the nature of a state's political regime does have determining influence on its economic wellbeing. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p1.8">His argument provides a means of understanding the fall of Chinese autocracy and the rise of democratic Western states since in the Late Middle Ages. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.8">One can therefore contrast the impact of democratic and autocratic regimes on a state's economy both on the basis of Olson's theory and through the historical example of the Chinese experience. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.8">Such an analysis seems to reveal that "it is no accident that the countries that have reached the highest level of economic development . . . are all stable democracies." <ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.001"/> </s>

<p n="p2.8">
<s n="s1.5;p2.8">Olson initiates his comparison of different political regimes with the observation that order is a necessary incentive for production: in the absence of security, public goods are not provided due to the free rider problem<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.002"/>, and the Fundamental Problem of Exchange<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.003"/> impedes trade from occurring. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.8">In order to avoid anarchy, societies accept to be exploited by a 'stationary bandit', a dictator who achieves a 'monopoly of theft' from the people via taxation. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.8">As opposed to a 'roving bandit' who plunders the entire revenue of a population before moving to another territory, the stationary bandit acquires an 'ecompassing interest' in his society; he has an incentive for his society to increase productivity, as an increase in taxable production raises his own tax revenue. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.8">Consequently, the stationary bandit will protect his people so as to maintain an efficient work force, will provide public goods that increase productivity, and will not tax the society's full income so that individuals still retain the motivation to produce<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.004"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.5;p3.8">The positive contribution of the state to an economy's wellbeing can be illustrated by contrasting the fate of the Chinese empire and of European feudal regimes between the 7 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 14 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p3.8">While European growth stagnated in feudal and manorial structures that North describes as a "vast wilderness"<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.005"/>, China flourished thanks to the efficient functioning of a bureaucratic state. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p3.8">The Chinese bureaucracy maintained the state unitary by coordinating logistics, taxation and defence efficiently throughout the empire<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.006"/>; the standardisation of weights and measures and similar systems introduced by the bureaucracy ensured good conditions for commerce; well-defined property rights further contributed to encouraging citizens in the accumulation of wealth<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.007"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p3.8">Thanks to a centralised system of government, Chinese per capita GDP rose from $450 to $600 over the first millennium, whereas European levels had only reached $500 by the thirteenth century<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.008"/>. </s>

<s n="s2.8;p4.8">A leader's encompassing interest determines his provision of public goods to society and the level of taxation he imposes. </s>
<s n="s3.8;p4.8">In purely numerical terms, if an autocrat taxes one-quarter of any increase in income in society, he receives one-quarter of the benefits from the public goods he provides<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.009"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.8;p4.8">Consequently, the greater the society or the smaller the leader's share in national income, the less his provision of public goods and the higher the tax rate he imposes. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p4.8">This has implications for comparing the "reach of dictatorships and democracies"<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.010"/>. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p4.8">As an autocrat's sole revenue from society is in the form of taxes, he will set taxes at the highest level that the population can pay without lowering its productivity. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p4.8">A democratic leader, on the other hand, represents the interests of a majority and therefore earns a large share of society's income in addition to tax revenue; democracies will therefore exact lower tax rates on the work force than will autocracies. </s>
<s n="s8.8;p4.8">Olson sees democracies' ability to "preven[t] significant extraction of social surplus by their leaders" as a "great advantage"<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.011"/>, which provides greater incentive for production in citizens and leads to economic growth. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p5.8">The disadvantages of an autocracy's narrow encompassing interest are well illustrated by the fall of Chinese economic performance after the thirteenth century. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.8">In the Late Middle Ages, China declined dramatically with respect to rising West European states: while European per capita GDP soared from $500 to $870 between 1280 and 1700, Chinese figures remained constant at $600 over this time period<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.012"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.8">Although Europe and China had similar market structures in terms of agricultural surplus, specialization, and mercantile policies<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.013"/>, these regions differed in terms of their contrasted political regimes. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.8">China's bureaucratic elite, created on a selective meritocratic basis and representing less than one percent of the population, had a comparatively low encompassing interest in society. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.8">Indeed, certain state decisions seem to have reflected only the interests of the ruling minority: for example, a 15 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century ban on trading expeditions to the 'Western Oceans' had catastrophic repercussions on the economy, and was simply the result of rivalry between the bureaucracy and a rising eunuch aristocracy<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.014"/>. </s>

<s n="s1.6;p6.8">In this vein, Max Weber argues that it was the "predatory bureaucratic behaviour" of the Chinese state that impeded capitalistic development<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.015"/>; this idea is shared by both Maddison<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.016"/> and by Deng<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.017"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p6.8">"Rent-seeking . . . and exploitative landlordism" <ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.018"/>, contributed not only to the decline of China, but also to the economic demise of certain West European states in the Late Middle Ages. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p6.8">In 1428, when the French Estates General gave Charles VII monopoly of tax power, the king levied taxes without popular consent; while the crown's tax revenue increased threefold in real terms over the Renaissance period<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.019"/>, this fiscal policy left the population with no incentive to accumulate capital. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p6.8">Representative bodies in Spain similarly surrendered taxation control to the monarchy in the 16 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century; as in the case of France, unchecked rulers abused their absolute power, so that "seizure, confiscation, or the unilateral alteration of contracts [became] recurrent phenomena"<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.020"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p6.8">Consequently, French and Spanish GDP per capita figures only reached $727 and $462 respectively in the year 1500, whereas the Western European average lay higher at $774<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.021"/>. </s>

<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.022"/>
<s n="s4.9;p7.8">Furthermore, the Venetian state adopted a fiscal system that encouraged capital accumulation, setting taxes below the tax revenue maximising point so as to attract the business of foreign merchants<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.023"/>. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p7.8">A democratic regime additionally granted merchants a common voice in the form of guilds, whereas the Chinese bourgeoisie was wholly dependent upon the state for much of its activity. </s>

<s n="s7.9;p7.8">The advantages that Olson attaches to democratic rule are also exemplified by the economic success of Britain in the Early Modern Period: while the secular Chinese state had no religious or military bodies to balance the power of the state, the monarchy's supremacy was highly contested in Britain, where Sir Edward Coke sought to limit the crown's special privileges<ref target="BAWE_0138g-ftnote.025"/>; indeed, after 1688, a system of Parliament dominated state decisions. </s>
