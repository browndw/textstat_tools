<s n="s3.5;p1.46">For the past 150 years, engineering practice has been based on controlling, rather than co-operating with, nature. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.46">Projects have gone ahead with no thought for their social, economic and environmental impact on natural systems. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p2.46">In the case of water, overuse is highlighted in the short term by drought. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.46">However, the effect of society's addiction to fossil-fuelled power is less obvious (1). </s>

<p n="p3.46">
<s n="s1.4;p3.46">In the last 10 years, managers have seen from experience that the social, environmental, economic, cultural and ethical aspects of a project are often more important than the technical aspects (6). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p3.46">This knowledge is finally filtering through to society, particularly in Europe, where the Kyoto protocol has been widely accepted. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p3.46">There are now clear signs that the changing environment is adversely affecting human life. </s>

<s n="s1.4;p10.46">Although man-made technology has been the cause of many problems, it is likely to also be the solution. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p10.46">Many eco-friendly technologies are being developed, the clear frontrunners being recycling (which accounts for nearly a third of the waste from many European countries) (2) and wind power (which in Spain and Denmark will regularly contribute 20% of total power consumption) - <hi rend="italic">Wind</hi>, Geoff Nairn, (3). </s>

</p>
<p n="p12.46">
<s n="s1.4;p12.46">If there is to be radical change, it will have to stem mainly from government policy. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p12.46">In many countries there are schemes and subsidies for research and implementation of eco-friendly technologies, but some (namely the US) are still refuting the need for action. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p12.46">Industry has become a cornerstone of economic stability or economic growth, thus all countries fear a reduction in industrial output. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p12.46">"The truth is no country is going to cut its growth of consumption in the light of a long-term environmental problem" - Tony Blair, at the Clinton Global Initiative, New York in September. </s>
