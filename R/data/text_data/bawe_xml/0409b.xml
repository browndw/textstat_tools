<s n="s1.6;p20.28">Throughout legal history the successive extensions of rights to new entities were 'unthinkable': it was unthinkable that children could have rights when they were considered as incomplete human beings and less than a person; it was unthinkable to grant rights to women because it was believed that they were not worthy enough to receive faith and have reason; it was unthinkable to consider Blacks, Indians, disabled people as perfectly humans and hence to give them rights equal to those held by the "White-Christian-Male". </s>
