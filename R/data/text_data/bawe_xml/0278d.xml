<s n="s2.6;p1.18">Indeed, entrepreneurs are fundamentally marketer and must be able to innovate within, where more successful entrepreneurs are more acute in managing organizational changes, necessary to absorb the transactions. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p1.18">Furthermore, when faced with an opportunity, an entrepreneur must be able to access and gain relevant resources and then co-ordinate and configure them in a particularly appropriate way so that collectively they deliver value in a unique and inimitable manner<ref target="BAWE_0278d-ftnote.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p1.18">Another important aspect is that entrepreneurs must discover and exploit the opportunities that are not being used and it is through competitive advantage that the firm attempts to exploit these opportunities. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p1.18">Thus, even though, the entrepreneurial venture is built from innovative combinations of financial, operating and human resources<ref target="BAWE_0278d-ftnote.003"/>, the network is more crucial key to the success as it provides resources critical to the firm's competitive strategy, where it will allow the firm to break into new markets during the crucial early stage development of the new business and provide a competitive advantage. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p1.18">However, it must be remembered that the effect of the network are not unequivocally positive, where "its incidence and value seem to depend on the size, type, and developmental stage of the firm in question as well as on its competitive strategy." <ref target="BAWE_0278d-ftnote.004"/> </s>
