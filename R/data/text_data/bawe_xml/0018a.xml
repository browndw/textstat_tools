<p n="p4.99">
<s n="s1.4;p4.99">To give this automatic read out of the torsion, it was decided that a torque cell should be implemented. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p4.99">A torque cell was a transducer and transducers were devices used for the measurement of a physical quantity by electrical means, i.e. used to convert non-electrical measurands into electrical quantities. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.99">They were used because this method often assisted subsequent operations on the data. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p4.99">In this case, the torque cell was converted an applied torque into an electrical output signal. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.99">
<s n="s1.6;p5.99">A torque cell contained a mechanical element- the circular shaft, and a sensor- strain gauges. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p5.99">Firstly the type of strain gauges was chosen. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p5.99">In fact there were two types of gauges, metal or semiconductor. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p5.99">The metal gauges were in the form of a flat coil of wire or etched metal foil and the semiconductor gauges were a strip of semiconductor material in-between two connection leads. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p5.99">The element was wafer-like and had an insulating backing material so that it could be stuck like a postage stamp onto surfaces, using a suitable adhesive. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p5.99">Strain gauges worked on the principal that: </s>

<list type="simple">
<item> R = resistance, </item>

<item>L = length, and </item>
<item>A = area of the element.</item>
</list>
<p n="p8.99">
<s n="s1.2;p8.99">So when the element was stretched, its length increased, its cross-sectional area decreased, and there was also a change in its resistivity. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.99">The result was that the resistance of the element changes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.99">
<s n="s1.3;p9.99">Generally, the semiconductor strain gauges were made from silicon and they had a much higher gauge factors than the metal ones which made them much more sensitive than the metal ones (Gauge factors were between 100 - 175 or -100 to -140 depending on whether the silicon was doped with 'P' or 'N' type material, compared with gauge factors of 2 for the metal ones), but it didn't mean that they were automatically better than the metal ones though. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.99">The strain gauges based on semiconductor materials were rather more expensive, more difficult to apply and had greater sensitivity to temperature changes than the metal ones. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.99">The greater sensitivity to temperature changes meant that the relative change in resistance is now non-linear and therefore more complicated. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.99">
<s n="s1.1;p10.99">Due to these negative points, the metal foil strain gauges were chosen. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.99">
<s n="s1.5;p11.99">Four active strain gauges are used in order to obtain maximum possible bridge output voltages, to provide temperature compensation, and to make the sensor/transducer insensitive to forces and moments other than the one being measured. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p11.99">These are mounted on two perpendicular 45 helices that are diametrically opposite to one another. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p11.99">Gauges 1 and 3, are mounted on the right hand helix, and sense a positive strain (tension), and gauges 2 and 4, mounted on the left-hand helix, sense a negative strain (compression). </s>
