<s n="s1.5;p1.45">A monopoly is where the market for a product is dominated by a single seller. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p1.45">Monopoly tends to have the following characteristics, price above marginal cost, consequently output is lower and a greater than normal profit. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p1.45">This affects consumers in that they pay a higher price than if the market was competitive. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p1.45">This will obviously have an effect on economic or Pareto efficiency. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p1.45">Efficiency in this case, means that there can be no Pareto improvement; a Pareto improvement is where a group of people can be made better off without making any other group of people worse off. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.45">
<s n="s1.3;p2.45">Logically it can be seen that a monopoly is inefficient as the consumers are worse off with a higher price and lower output than they would be in a competitive market. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.45">This, however, leads to the monopolist firm being better off. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.45">To decide whether a monopoly is inefficient on these grounds would require a method to evaluate the relative welfare changes in a monopoly compared with competition. </s>

<s n="s3.8;p3.45">If this was a competitive market the firm would produce at (p <hi rend="sub">c</hi>, y <hi rend="sub">c</hi>), in a monopoly the firm would produce at (p <hi rend="sub">m</hi>, y <hi rend="sub">m</hi>). </s>
<s n="s4.8;p3.45">In this situation the monopolist has chosen output at MR = MC and chosen the maximum price that consumers will pay at the quantity y <hi rend="sub">m</hi>, this is given by the demand curve. </s>
<s n="s5.8;p3.45">In order to find a Pareto improvement, consider the monopoly situation between the two equilibriums, at output y <hi rend="sub">m</hi>. </s>
<s n="s6.8;p3.45">There will be a consumer willing to pay some p between the monopoly price at y <hi rend="sub">m</hi> and the marginal cost at y <hi rend="sub">m</hi>. </s>
<s n="s7.8;p3.45">Clearly, the monopolist firm will make more profit, as long as the monopolist continues to produce y <hi rend="sub">m</hi> at the monopoly price, and the consumer will have paid a price lower than the monopoly price, this means that both consumer and firm are 'better off', therefore, a Pareto improvement. </s>

<s n="s4.6;p4.45">Vertical integration happens when firms at different stages of production combine, creating a vertical monopoly. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p4.45">To determine whether a vertically integrated market is more efficient than a vertically disintegrated market, with a monopoly firm at each stage, the expression for profit and output can be analysed for both situations. </s>

<s n="s1.10;p33.45">However, the theory of contestable markets states that a monopoly will be forced to be efficient if faced with a contestable market to avoid new entrants. </s>
<s n="s2.10;p33.45">This implies that potential competition is as important as real competition. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p33.45">An incumbent firm will fear 'hit and run' competitors who take advantage of the supernormal profits and exit the market again when normal profits are restored. </s>

<s n="s5.10;p33.45">However, there is nothing to prevent the incumbent from making supernormal profits until a new competitor enters, the incumbent firm must decide whether short term supernormal profit is worth the longer term risk. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p33.45">If the firm chooses to produce at the competitive level of profit and price, the monopoly will be more economically efficient than if the market was incontestable. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p33.45">However, if the monopolist chooses to keep making supernormal profits the market will remain inefficient until a new firm enters the market, when it will become more economically efficient. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p33.45">The extent to which the efficiency increases depends on how long the competitor remains in the market or whether the two firms cooperate and form a duopoly. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p33.45">If the competitor exits quickly, the monopoly inefficiency would resume. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p33.45">If the competitor remained in the market, either the market would become efficient with the entry of more new firms or a duopoly would form, which would still be economically inefficient if the firms cooperated. </s>

<s n="s1.15;p34.45">New technology can increase efficiency by improving methods of production, and creating new products. </s>

<s n="s3.15;p34.45">However, if a firm develops a new technology, in a perfectly competitive markets it competitors would be able to use the development. </s>
<s n="s4.15;p34.45">There is no incentive for each firm to spend its profits on research and development when all firms share the benefits. </s>
<s n="s5.15;p34.45">Patents are implemented to solve this. </s>
<s n="s6.15;p34.45">A patent creates a short term monopoly to provide firms with an incentive for innovation. </s>
<s n="s7.15;p34.45">The firm will then directly benefit from the invention in the form of supernormal profits. </s>
<s n="s8.15;p34.45">This causes economic inefficiency in short term. </s>
<s n="s9.15;p34.45">However, in the longer run, when the patent has expired economic efficiency will resume as all firms take advantage of the new technology, competing with the original firm. </s>
<s n="s10.15;p34.45">If, however, there were no patents, this long term gain in efficiency may not have taken place. </s>
<s n="s11.15;p34.45">This is an example of a short term monopoly creating efficiency. </s>
<s n="s12.15;p34.45">The extent of the efficiency depends on the length of the patent. </s>
<s n="s13.15;p34.45">A patent that is too long will create a longer period of monopoly and will cause greater inefficiency; however, a short patent is not a big enough incentive for firms to innovate. </s>
<s n="s14.15;p34.45">The optimal length of a patent has been researched by William Nordhaus who researched the optimal life of a patent in terms of the length of time that maximises consumer surplus, therefore the least inefficient. </s>
<s n="s15.15;p34.45">This is dependent on the elasticity of demand, the importance of the invention and government taxation among other factors. (''The Optimal Life of a Patent'', William Nordhaus) </s>

<s n="s4.9;p35.45">A company with strong brand loyalty will be able to act as a monopolist in the market they create for their individual product. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p35.45">This will lead to a lower consumer surplus, supernormal profits and consequently, economic inefficiency. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p35.45">The monopoly is created because the marketing makes the consumer believe the product is differentiated from the other products in the market. </s>
