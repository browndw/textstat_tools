<s n="s1.4;p1.59">The wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) has often been found to express the symptoms of 'insular syndrome'. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p1.59">This is not a disease but a phenomena that occurs within island populations of a variety of vertebrates, and is expressed in the evolution of a different body size, and occasionally altered behavioural patterns. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p1.59">Preliminary investigations of small mammals on the Isle of Cumbrae, Scotland, produced a wood mouse of large proportions and lead us to investigate further into the possibility of the occurrence of insular syndrome in the island population. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p1.59">The results were inconclusive as only two mice were caught overall and one of them gave birth after it was caught, however unusual population densities of Wood mice and Common Shrews (<hi rend="italic">Sorex aranaeus</hi>) were found which may need further investigation. </s>

<head rend="underlined">Insular syndrome</head>
<p n="p2.59">
<s n="s1.5;p2.59">Island populations differ from most on the mainland in that they are isolated to varying extents from other populations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p2.59">When a species first populates an island it may find itself in a very different environment from the niche it has evolved to fit on the mainland. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p2.59">The isolation of the species from the mainland gene pool along with new environmental pressures on its survival may lead to the evolution of new characteristics. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p2.59">Islands may be of varying sizes and of varying distances from the mainland. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p2.59">There may also be differences in the ecology of the island due to which other species have successfully immigrated and become established, these may be competitors or predators of the newly arrived species and may occupy only a few of the available niches on the island. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.59">
<s n="s1.13;p3.59">Also known as 'The Island Rule', insular syndrome describes the trend for animals on islands to evolve into either larger or smaller versions of their mainland species. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p3.59">Generally animals over 100g are thought to evolve into dwarf forms while smaller animals below 100g such as rodents evolve into giant forms( Van Valen, 1973, Lomolino, 1985). </s>
<s n="s3.13;p3.59">The first biologist to try and explain this phenomenon was J. Bristol Foster in 1964; studying island mammals, he reasoned that smaller animals grew large due to reduced pressures from predators and competitors on the islands. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p3.59">He also concluded that large animals became smaller due to the lack of enough food that could sustain a larger sized population. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p3.59">In 1978, soon after 'The Theory of Island Biogeography' was published by Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson (1967) which lead to increased scientific interest on the subject, T. J. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p3.59">Case published, 'A general explanation for insular body size trends in terrestrial vertebrates' that expanded on Fosters work greatly. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p3.59">He noted that the explanations given by Foster were far too simple and that many exceptions existed. </s>
<s n="s8.13;p3.59">He also included reptiles in his study, and included much more data in his work. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p3.59">One example presented by Case of an exception to Fosters explanation was the case of two rattlesnake species that cohabit on the island Angel de la Guarda in the Gulf of California. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p3.59">On the island, Crotalus mitchelli is about two times the size of C. ruber, however on the mainland of Mexico this is the other way round. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p3.59">Case's explanation is that C. mitchelli arrived first on the island and evolved to become larger in order that all available prey could be utilised, then when C. ruber arrived only the 'smaller rattlesnake niche' was available so it evolved to fit that instead. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p3.59">This shows that size change in a species can depend greatly on the other life already established on an island. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p3.59">Other differences to island populations of rodents exhibiting insular syndrome, include higher, more stable densities, reduced aggressiveness, reproductive output, dispersal and better survival (Adler and Levins 1994). </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.59">
<s n="s1.3;p4.59">Insular syndrome has often been seen in rodents and many studies have been done on Apodemus spp. around the world (Cranbrook, 1957, Delany &amp; Healy 1964, Berry, Evans, &amp; Sennitt 1967, Delany 1970, Kahmann &amp; Niethammer 1971, Berry 1973, 1975, Gliwicz 1980, Angerbjorn 1986, Granjon &amp; Cheylan 1988, Adler &amp; Levins 1994, Sara &amp; Casamento 1995, Michaux, Liboix &amp; Fons 1996a, Michaux, Sara, Libois &amp; Matagne 1998b). </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.59">Gigantism has been the general pattern and various explanations have been suggested. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.59">Angerbjorn (1986) sums these up with a series of six 'predictions': </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.59">
<s n="s1.1;p5.59">Prediction 1 </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.59">
<s n="s1.1;p6.59">Animals on Islands at higher latitudes and at long distances from mainland should exhibit larger body sizes due to cooler (Bergmann, 1847, Foster 1965) or less variable climate (Case 1978). </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.59">
<s n="s1.1;p7.59">Prediction 2 </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.59">
<s n="s1.1;p8.59">The body size of small mammals would decrease with decreasing island size due to food limitations or likelihood of extinction (Heaney 1978, Wasserzugal. 1979) </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.59">
<s n="s1.1;p9.59">Small mammal body size should increase with decreasing island area due to differences in age specific survivorship (Melton 1982) </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.59">
<s n="s1.1;p10.59">Prediction 3 </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.59">
<s n="s1.1;p11.59">Increasing distance from the mainland restricts dispersal and so leads to increased population density, this leads to an increase in body size (Melton 1982) or a decrease in body size (Wasserzugal. 1979) </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.59">
<s n="s1.1;p12.59">Prediction 4 </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.59">
<s n="s1.3;p13.59">Species Diversity tends to decrease with island area (Macarthur and Wilson 1967) and so smaller numbers of predators and competitors may be present on smaller islands. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p13.59">A small species of mouse is subsequently expected to be larger on an island lacking a larger competitor species and a large mouse should be smaller on an island lacking a smaller competitor species. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p13.59">Thereby the species would adapt to use the greatest possible niche and its resources (Angerbjorn 1986). </s>
</p>
<p n="p14.59">
<s n="s1.1;p14.59">Prediction 5 </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.59">
<s n="s1.1;p15.59">When certain predators are absent animals should evolve to be larger as they would be at an advantages compared with smaller conspecifics (Angerbjorn 1986) </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.59">
<s n="s1.1;p16.59">Prediction 6 </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.59">
<s n="s1.2;p17.59">'Body size trends on islands should be random in direction' (Angerbjorn 1986). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.59">This prediction relates to the genetic isolation that occurs in island populations and how 'the founder principle' (Mayr 1942) may affect their size. </s>
</p>
<p n="p18.59">
<s n="s1.2;p18.59">Although Angerbjorn sides with predictions 5 and 6 it is important to consider all of the aspects as each may have varying effects on different islands. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p18.59">Our aim is to look at these variables and see whether the Wood Mouse (<hi rend="italic">Apodemus sylvaticus</hi>) on the Isle of Cumbrae is affected by insular syndrome. </s>

I have kept live mice form Arran, Bute and Cumbrae in cages at the same time and neither I nor any other zoologist who saw them could detect the slightest difference. In this respect it is worth noting that when Barrat-Hamilton and Hinton first examined these Clyde island mice they came to the conclusion, in their 1913 paper, that they were ''unable to distinguish the specimens from the islands from <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> <hi rend="italic">sylvaticus</hi> of the mainland''. It was only in the later 1914 paper, after pages of intricate cranial measurements, that separation was made. I have not seen this fact of earlier 'lumping' referred to previously, but to me it seems significant, and it is also interesting to note that Harrison Matthews in his recent book on British Mammals (1952) entirely omits these Clyde Island races from his systematic list''.</quote>

<s n="s1.2;p55.59">The results gained from the trapping period for wood mice were not enough to form any solid conclusions on the island <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> sizes, compared with mainland <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> sizes. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p55.59">Also the <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> data gathered showed them to be the same size as mainland populations as the measurements were all within the mammal society range (The mammal society 2005). </s>
</p>
<p n="p56.59">
<s n="s1.3;p56.59">The results gained from the <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> show that they are not significantly different from the British mainland populations in the parameters that were looked at. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p56.59">Some island populations of <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> have been found to differ in the frequent lack of 5 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> unicuspid teeth and having very grey flanks (The Handbook of British Mammals 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Ed, 1977). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p56.59">These characteristics were not investigated in this survey. </s>
</p>
<p n="p57.59">
<s n="s1.1;p57.59">Why were so few mice caught and so many shrews? </s>
</p>
<p n="p58.59">
<s n="s1.12;p58.59">If the results are to be considered a representation of the small mammal populations of Cumbrae then it seems that <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> are unusually abundant and <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> are found in much smaller numbers. </s>
<s n="s2.12;p58.59">Also many other species thought to be present on Cumbrae were not caught such as pigmy shrews and voles, these species are usually caught on the mainland and may indicate a lack of competitor species on the island. </s>
<s n="s3.12;p58.59">The two species should be equally as 'trappable' on Cumbrae as on the British mainland, however population density cannot be compared directly to mainland results for similar environments due to the incompatibility of the random trap layout used in this experiment with the transect layout of the British Mammal Societies survey traps. </s>
<s n="s4.12;p58.59">However estimates and experiences (Colin Prescott) of mainland trapping, suggest that there should be a higher density of <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> (0.25-100/ha (The Handbook of British Mammals, 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Ed, 1977)) than <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> (49/ha (Crowcroft 1957)) present but this did not seem to be the case. </s>
<s n="s5.12;p58.59">This may have been due to the availability of suitable foods or habitat; also it could have been due to predation. </s>
<s n="s6.12;p58.59">
<hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> are insectivores and live on a diet of invertebrates whereas <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> eats mainly seeds and fruits but also arthropods, therefore they avoid direct competition for food. </s>
<s n="s7.12;p58.59">The main predators of <hi rend="italic"> S. aranaeus</hi> are owls, in particular barn owls which are known to be present on Cumbrae but may not be evenly distributed as it is suggested that they are more commonly viewed on the north of the island and so may consume more <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> there than on the south side where most of the <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> were caught. </s>
<s n="s8.12;p58.59">Other predators of <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> include tawny owls, kestrels, polecats, possibly rats and domestic cats, however they are often killed but not eaten by cats due to a foul tasting liquid that is produced from glands on the skin. </s>
<s n="s9.12;p58.59">
<hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> predators present on the island include domestic cats, kestrels, tawny owl, buzzards, brown rats and the polecat. </s>
<s n="s10.12;p58.59">The area around the marine station may have been a sanctuary from many of these predators due to the presence and activities of humans. </s>
<s n="s11.12;p58.59">From the results of the trapping it appears that there are only these two small mammals present on Cumbrae therefore there may be an uneven occurrence of predation between the species, <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> may be disadvantaged due to their larger size but <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> may be disadvantaged due to their need to be active all of the time and may therefore be more likely to be seen by predators. </s>
<s n="s12.12;p58.59">Advantages of <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> characteristics increasing its survival chances may be its more general diet but the <hi rend="italic"> S. aranaeus</hi> ability to produce foul tasting liquid from its skin may decrease its chances of being eaten and therefore be an advantage to them. </s>
</p>
<p n="p59.59">
<s n="s1.5;p59.59">The trapping period was not extensive enough to answer the questions posed on the differences between British mainland and Island populations of <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi>, nor were the observations made substantial enough to answer questions about differences in the <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> populations. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p59.59">Another important observation that was not made was whether the animals were in their adult stage of life as this would be important in order that the sizes could be comparable with current records (Lomolino 1985). </s>
<s n="s3.5;p59.59">Further research into the unexpected densities of <hi rend="italic">S. aranaeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.sylvaticus</hi> could be done by firstly doing a survey comparable to that on the mainland to identify population densities, and secondly investigating the diet of predators on the island. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p59.59">For example owl pellets could be examined to identify the bones contained within them and to which species they belong. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p59.59">It must be noted however that permission would need to be gained to specifically intend to trap shrews. </s>
