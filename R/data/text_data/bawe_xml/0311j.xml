<p n="p2.29">
<s n="s1.3;p2.29">The intended outcome of the assignments was to find the minimum energy configuration of a set number of 'atoms' experiencing a mutual Lennard-Jones interaction of form <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0311j-form.001"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p2.29">This was achieved using Monte Carlo methods to pseudorandomly shift the position of each atom and see if the energy was acceptable according to a Boltzmann distribution, with energy proportional to <formula notation="" id="BAWE_0311j-form.002"/>. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p2.29">From this you can understand that the temperature of the system, <hi rend="italic">T</hi>, is an important parameter in that it has a large effect on the outcome (and energy) of the configuration. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p4.29">If the energy is favourable then the change is accepted, else the atom is placed back. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p4.29">At the end, the program returns the final energy per atom along with how many moves were accepted. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p8.29">OpenMP was then added to the code. </s>
