<s n="s5.7;p3.28">Consequently, any act that takes the rights of ownership from the owner and places them with another person is an appropriation. </s>
<s n="s6.7;p3.28">In the case of Morris (1984)<ref target="BAWE_0143e-ftnote.002"/>, this was confirmed, and this view was furthered in Gomez (1993)<ref target="BAWE_0143e-ftnote.003"/>. </s>

<p n="p4.28">
<s n="s1.3;p4.28">The mens rea of theft is that the appropriation was committed 'dishonestly' with 'the intention of permanently depriving the other of it'. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p4.28">It is blatant that the defendants did not intend to return the mobile telephones, as their sole purpose in stealing them was to make money from doing so. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p4.28">Amy and Felicity also do not have any legal excuse for their appropriations, making them unquestionably dishonest. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.28">
<s n="s1.3;p5.28">The incredibly broad nature of the actus reus of theft has caused much controversy. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p5.28">The main criticism appears to be that due to the wide scope of the actus reus, the main burden of proof upon the defence becomes disproving dishonesty, which, due to the lack of statutory excuses for appropriation,<ref target="BAWE_0143e-ftnote.004"/> has developed into a particularly arduous task. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p5.28">Therefore, the English law of theft is often criticised, although valid, realistic reforms have yet to be suggested. </s>

<p n="p6.28">
<s n="s1.1;p6.28">If Amy and Felicity used the rulers they were carrying in their pockets in order to aid them in their attaining the telephones, they could be found liable for robbery. </s>

<p n="p7.28">
<s n="s1.4;p7.28">Robbery is detailed in section 8 of the Theft Act 1968<ref target="BAWE_0143e-ftnote.005"/>. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.28">The actus reus of robbery does not require the defendants to actually be armed - they simply need to have made or sought to make their victims fear some sort of harm. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.28">Felicity and Amy agreed to carry the rulers so that if needs be, they could scare their victims by making them believe they were armed. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.28">Consequently, it would be difficult for the defence to prove that they were not guilty of robbery if they had indeed used the rulers. </s>
</p>
<note place="foot" id="BAWE_0143e-ftnote.005">
<p n="pn1.1">
<s n="s1.1;pn1.1">For this offence to be applied, it has to be proven that the defendant not only had the required mens rea and actus reus for theft, but also, <hi rend="italic">"...immediately before or at the time of stealing, and in order to steal, used force on a person or put or sought to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force."</hi> </s>
</p>
</note>
<p n="p8.28">
<s n="s1.6;p8.28">However, even though they could have been convicted of robbery, this does not mean that their crime was fairly labelled. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p8.28">Regardless of gravity, all people using force during a theft are labelled 'robbers'. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p8.28">This means that everyone from a highly dangerous, professional bank-robber, to a young teenager committing an impulsive 'bag-snatch' will be labelled equally. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p8.28">This is clearly unfair. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p8.28">Consequently, many have demanded that for this offence to be tiered according to severity and danger of the acts involved. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p8.28">As the law stands however, no reforms are on the horizon, and all forceful thieves are still being labelled robbers, regardless of the exact crime they committed. </s>
</p>
<p n="p9.28">
<s n="s1.5;p9.28">The law of robbery is also questioned in relation to its sanctions. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p9.28">If Amy and Felicity were to be found guilty of plain theft, they could be sent to prison for a maximum of seven years. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p9.28">If they committed simply the act of scaring the victim, this would probably be construed as common assault, the maximum penalty for which is six months imprisonment. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p9.28">If however, they committed the two acts simultaneously, and were subsequently convicted of robbery, their maximum sentence would be life. </s>
<s n="s5.5;p9.28">The just nature of this huge increase in sentence for the addition of common assault is very questionable, although policy reasons such as protection of the public and the possible dangerous nature of such an offence are often cited as rationalization of this seemingly absurd maximum sentence for all levels of robbery. </s>

<p n="p10.28">
<s n="s1.2;p10.28">Amy's looking through Caroline's coat with the intention of stealing her mobile telephone could lead to both Amy and Felicity being convicted of attempted theft. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.28">Due to the lack of force used to actually attempt to acquire the 'phone (the force used was entirely independent of this act), I think it unlikely that attempted robbery would be the charge. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.28">
<s n="s1.4;p11.28">Amy's attempt was a complete one (meaning that she carried out the whole act, but simply did not reach the outcome she had desired). </s>
<s n="s2.4;p11.28">Due to both her and Felicity being part of the prior thefts (or robberies as it may be), it is likely that Felicity would also be held liable as part of a joint enterprise. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p11.28">In the case of Easom (1971)<ref target="BAWE_0143e-ftnote.006"/>, it was decided that if a person was found to be searching a container (in Amy's case, jacket pockets) in order to steal something, they should be charged with attempted theft. </s>

<s n="s3.6;p13.28">Obviously the injury was not wholly insignificant, because it caused Caroline to loose the sight in one of her eyes. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p13.28">The mens rea for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is recklessness or intent. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p13.28">I feel it could be shown very easily that Felicity at least intended to cause Caroline some harm, even if she did not intend to stab her in the eye with the ruler, but instead to simply hit her face with it. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p16.28">The very broad nature of the mens rea element of section 20 has lead to much condemnation of the law. </s>

</p>
<p n="p25.28">
<s n="s1.4;p25.28">The convictions for the other offences however, would be more difficult. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p25.28">Felicity's stabbing of Caroline could lead to a conviction for either assault occasioning actual bodily harm, or section 18 or 20 grievous bodily harm. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p25.28">I believe that section 18 GBH is the most likely charge here, due to Felicity carrying a 'weapon', and then stabbing it into the particularly vulnerable area of the eye. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p25.28">This would also, I feel, be a fair conviction, as stabbing a ruler into somebody's eye is clearly a dangerous act, causing the victim severe pain and possibly permanent damage to, or loss of their vision. </s>

<p n="p26.28">
<s n="s1.3;p26.28">Felicity's possible conviction for unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter may be slightly more controversial. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p26.28">This is because she may have only intended to cause Delia a small amount of harm, but due to the unfortunate chain of events caused by this act, a death was caused and Felicity could go to prison for life if the judge deemed this an appropriate sentence. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p26.28">The fairness of convicting someone with no intention for the crime they ultimately committed is contentious, and possibly indicates that the scope of our manslaughter law is far too wide, and should, through reform, be narrowed. </s>

<p n="p27.28">
<s n="s1.3;p27.28">However, I feel the most difficult charge to justify would be if Amy were to be convicted as an accomplice to Felicity's violent offences. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p27.28">Her knowledge of Felicity's violent nature would not necessarily mean she foresaw that her accomplice would stab a seemingly harmless ruler into the eye of a victim; after all, the rulers were there to scare their victims, not blind them. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p27.28">The nature of the death of Delia would also make the decision of the court more complex - could Amy have foreseen that Felicity would have punched a random railway passenger, causing her death? </s>
</p>
<p n="p28.28">
<s n="s1.1;p28.28">In conclusion, although it is impossible to say how an English court would decide in relation to both Amy and Felicity's cases, I feel that in light of their circumstances the explanations I have provided are the most likely to be taken under English law. </s>
