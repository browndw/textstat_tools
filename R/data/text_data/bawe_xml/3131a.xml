<div1 type="section">
<p n="p1.4">
<s n="s1.13;p1.4">A simplified initial view of Anne Bradshaw's poem 'The Author to Her Book' is that she has a negative view on her poetry. </s>
<s n="s2.13;p1.4">Within the first few lines of verse, she uses negative words and phrases; "ill-formed", "feeble"(1), "snatched"(3) and "exposed"(4), all of which primarily produce pessimistic connotations. </s>
<s n="s3.13;p1.4">They could also be considered litotes; the word "feeble" especially. </s>
<s n="s4.13;p1.4">Bradshaw goes on to describe how editing her writing is a difficult process, <hi rend="italic">"I cast thee by as one unfit for light"</hi>. </s>
<s n="s5.13;p1.4">This statement could be considered a continuation of the negative language felt earlier. </s>
<s n="s6.13;p1.4">To me however, she shows herself to be a highly competent poet, who is prepared to scrutinise her own work in order to achieve the best possible result. </s>
<s n="s7.13;p1.4">Indeed one could argue that from the moment the poem begins, she personifies her written work, likening it to the birth of a child, "Thou ill formed <hi rend="underlined">off-spring</hi> from my brain". </s>
<s n="s8.13;p1.4">Offspring is usually a word to describe something that is positive and special, something to be celebrated. </s>
<s n="s9.13;p1.4">One could infer therefore that Bradshaw draws attention to the weaknesses of her work in order to highlight its main strengths. </s>
<s n="s10.13;p1.4">Her modesty allows the reader to engage with the text in a more natural and sympathetic fashion. </s>
<s n="s11.13;p1.4">I do not feel for example, that the poem would have been as effective had she initially applauded her work. </s>
<s n="s12.13;p1.4">Bradshaw continues to use negative imagery throughout the rest of the poem. </s>
<s n="s13.13;p1.4">A hyperbole in line 10 exemplifies this, <hi rend="italic">"Thy visage was so irksome in my sight"</hi>, drawing further sympathy from the reader. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.4">
<s n="s1.4;p2.4">One might also see a socially contextual allegory in this image of the poem as her 'child'. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p2.4">As a female writer in the 17 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, Bradshaw's literature may not have seemed as widely accepted as that of her male counterparts. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p2.4">The image of her 'giving birth' to this writing celebrates motherhood and outlines the importance of female contribution to literature at the time. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p2.4">Her choice of masculine rhyme is probably to make her poem sound manlier, and enable her work to be more accepted amongst both genders. </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.4">
<s n="s1.6;p3.4">The poem is a 24-line verse, formed in regular iambic pentameter. </s>
<s n="s2.6;p3.4">The use of rhyming couplets adds a light tone, making poem easy to read. </s>
<s n="s3.6;p3.4">The 'fun' rhyme of the poem further supports the fact that Bradshaw is in-fact celebrative of her work. </s>
<s n="s4.6;p3.4">There are however, a few anomalies; in lines 19-22, Bradshaw does not use the expected rhyme scheme of J, J, K, K. Instead she alternates between J and K and uses half-rhyme. </s>
<s n="s5.6;p3.4">This would perhaps strengthen the content of these lines though, as the poet talks of "roam(ing)" and "find(ing)" - general feelings of disorientation. </s>
<s n="s6.6;p3.4">Here the rhyme scheme is itself 'disorientated'. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.4">
<s n="s1.5;p4.4">One sees interesting parallels with the work of Seamus Heaney in his poem 'Digging'. </s>
<s n="s2.5;p4.4">Both poets take themselves and the reader on a journey of self-identification, and begin to question their work or profession. </s>
<s n="s3.5;p4.4">Both relate to their families, and use figurative language to help describe their thoughts or inspirations. </s>
<s n="s4.5;p4.4">Heaney's thoughts are considered to be <hi rend="italic">'good turf'.</hi> </s>
<s n="s5.5;p4.4">It is also interesting to see how both poems begin with a fairly negative tone, but reach the conclusion that they are proud of their work as poets. </s>
