<p n="p6.21">
<s n="s1.4;p6.21">I chose the Eastern cemetery of Roman London as a case study, as the excavation (from 1983 to 1990) produced a large number of deliberately disposed human remains. </s>

<s n="s3.4;p6.21">Located outside the Eastern boundary of the Roman city, the cemetery is so large (encompassing 12 sites, with upwards of 29 burial plots) that archaeologists have been hesitant to confirm that it is in fact a single cemetery.<ref target="BAWE_6182g-ftnote.003"/> Due to the scale of the excavation an in-depth analysis of its wide-ranging findings would be inappropriate. </s>

<s n="s2.10;p8.21">The rare discovery of an in situ bustum (Plot 3) is sinificant, given the 'general paucity of evidence for pyre sites from any period in which the practice of cremation was in use'. </s>
<s n="s3.10;p8.21">Considering cremation's popularity, this absence of evidence for the actual process is surprising, yet pyres don't leave substantial deposits, rather 'very shallow evidence of their existence'<ref target="BAWE_6182g-ftnote.008"/> The bustum is evidence of a complex funerary rite, in which a pyre was cremated over a grave pit, and filled by the resultant debris of charcoal, wood and bone. </s>
<s n="s4.10;p8.21">Others are believed to have existed on site, but have not been preserved due to their delicacy. </s>
<s n="s5.10;p8.21">Other pyre debris deposits were found, dumped leftovers containing only fragments of bone; it is presumed the majority of remains were removed from the pyre and buried, possibly in an urn. </s>
<s n="s6.10;p8.21">These deposits were concentrated in two plots (21 and 28), which could imply rough contemporaneity, and that a group of people used certain burial rites in a separate area of the cemetery. </s>
<s n="s7.10;p8.21">However, conclusions about burial practices should not be drawn too hastily. </s>
<s n="s8.10;p8.21">Archaeologists involved with the cemetery explain that the site was one of the last to be excavated, 'by which time excavators had acquired the experience to recognise the significance of such deposits and the need to sample them'. </s>
<s n="s9.10;p8.21">Prior to this, deposits weren't recorded as extensively, a discrepancy rendering it impossible to make developed inferences from their locations. </s>
<s n="s10.10;p8.21">The poor survival of deposits in the first place only added to this problem. </s>
