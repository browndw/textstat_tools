<s n="s1.3;p40.44">From my analysis, I feel I can reasonably confidently conclude that the assessment DNA sequence was obtained from a T4-like bacteriophage such as S-PM2, since it appears to contain many homologous genes to those found in T4. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p40.44">It was previously known that S-PM2 shares a conserved genetic module with T4 that contains genes for structural proteins that make up the virion, so it is not surprising to find genes for two neck/collar proteins and a tail sheath protein in this sequence. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p40.44">Interestingly, genes similar to T4's gp13 to gp16 were found in the assessment sequence in the same order. </s>
