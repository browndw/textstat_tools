<s n="s1.9;p3.11">In the rehearing, the Lordships, except Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC, allowed the appeal. </s>
<s n="s2.9;p3.11">The Lordships reached this outcome based on a number of reasons. </s>
<s n="s3.9;p3.11">Firstly, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated 'that courts have a duty to give effect to the intention of the Parliament. </s>
<s n="s4.9;p3.11">In most cases, reference to parliamentary materials will not throw any light on the matter of dispute. </s>
<s n="s5.9;p3.11">However, in a few cases, where the Parliament has considered the very problem will give a clear indication of their intentions. </s>
<s n="s6.9;p3.11">Therefore, in this kind of situations, the courts should not turn a blind eye and construe words in the way that they cannot bear.' </s>
<s n="s7.9;p3.11">He then laid down three criteria which are to be fulfilled in order to permit reference to Hansard. </s>
<s n="s8.9;p3.11">They are where 1) legislation is ambiguous or obscure, or leads to an absurdity; 2) the material relied on consists of one or more statements by a minister or other promoter of the Bill together if necessary with such other parliamentary material as is necessary to understand such statements and their effect; and 3) the statements relied on are clear. </s>
<s n="s9.9;p3.11">The present case met these three criteria. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.11">
<s n="s1.2;p4.11">Secondly, Article 9 of the Bill of rights Act 1998 was not infringed on the grounds that, as per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, 'the plain meaning of Article 9 was to ensure that members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p4.11">The purpose of looking into Hansard is not to construe or criticise the words used by the ministers but to give effect to the words used as long as they are clear.' </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.11">
<s n="s1.1;p5.11">Lastly, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that parliamentary privileges do not exist in this case in absence of a claim of any privilege extending beyond that protected by the Bills of Rights from the Clerk of Commons or the Attorney General. </s>

<s n="s2.4;p6.11">Firstly, the literal approach where 'courts adopt a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language'.<ref target="BAWE_0132a-ftnote.008"/> Then, the purposive approach which the courts adopt now 'which seeks to give effect to the true purpose of the legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material'.<ref target="BAWE_0132a-ftnote.009"/> There are three rules in statutory interpretation. </s>
