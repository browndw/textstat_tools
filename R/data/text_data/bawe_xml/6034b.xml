<p n="p1.34">
<s n="s1.3;p1.34">Why do consumers chose what they chose and by what they buy? </s>
<s n="s2.3;p1.34">Researchers have identified a number of criteria that are used by people while making their purchase decisions. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p1.34">Among those factors most frequently mentioned are price, brand and store name as well as country of product origin. </s>
</p>
<p n="p2.34">
<s n="s1.1;p2.34">The question that the following research attempts to answer is how important the abovementioned external product attributes are to consumers from various socio-economic backgrounds, when they shop at Marks and Spencer (M&amp;S). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.34">
<s n="s1.2;p3.34">The survey is based on 23 questions, designed to be easy to answer as responses should be rapid and spontaneous. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.34">The survey asks about peoples perception of intangible phenomena, therefore the semantic differential was predominantly used in order to allow respondents to express intensity of their positive or negative attitudes. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.34">
<s n="s1.1;p4.34">The nature of questions and the quota sampling fit the survey method selected for this study, namely the computer assisted mall-intercept, where the time of questionnaire completion is a crucial factor. </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.34">
<s n="s1.2;p5.34">The paper is structured as follows: section 2 contains a brief review of the literature related to the subject of customer's choice determinants; section 3 presents the proposed interviewing strategy followed by a basic cost analysis; while section 4 validates the choice of a sampling method. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p5.34">The developed questionnaire is placed in an appendix at the very end if the document. </s>
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section">
<head rend="bold">2. Price, brand, product origin and store name: how much do they matter? </head>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Price</head>
<p n="p6.34">
<s n="s1.3;p6.34">East, (1997) states, that price can inform the consumer about the good, and specifically of its quality, however, Engel (1995) claims that the importance of price as evaluative criterion is often overestimated. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p6.34">To prove this point he quotes research, in which supermarket shoppers were asked the price of an item they had just placed in their shopping basket and less than a half of them could do so. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p6.34">East (1997) explains that customers' problems to recall prices result from the increasing number of promotions, brands and greater affluence that make prices less important than before. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.34">
<s n="s1.4;p7.34">Further, East (1997) presents some of the older research by Stoetzel (1954), who suggested, that consumers have an acceptable price range with upper and lower limits. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p7.34">When the price is beyond the upper limit the product is seen as too expensive. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p7.34">When it is too low the product quality may be questioned. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p7.34">Thus to be purchased the product must fall within the acceptable price range. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.34">
<s n="s1.1;p8.34">East (1997) also claims, that customers more concerned about price usually pay less attention to the brand of a product. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Brand name</head>
<p n="p9.34">
<s n="s1.3;p9.34">The literature gives very simple answer to the question, how much does the brand matter: the customers like brands that meet their needs and wants well. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.34">If they have a positive usage experience, will seek that reward again. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.34">(Sheth <hi rend="italic">et a</hi>l, 1999), and develop the so-called brand loyalty. </s>
</p>
<p n="p10.34">
<s n="s1.3;p10.34">The above-mentioned concept has been described from various standpoints by numerous authors (Engel (1995); East (1997)), quoting exhaustively research dating back to early 50s. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p10.34">However Sheth (1999) putts the case most clearly. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p10.34">He states, that customer loyalty is a customer's commitment to a brand or a store, based on a strong favourable attitude and manifested in consistent purchasing behaviour. </s>
</p>
<p n="p11.34">
<s n="s1.2;p11.34">He argues that there are two ways to think of brand loyalty: brand loyalty as behaviour (what brands people buy) and as an attitude (how they feel about brands. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p11.34">True loyalty incorporates both aspects. </s>
</p>
<p n="p12.34">
<s n="s1.3;p12.34">East (1997) states that people may like a brand, but not purchase it through lack of opportunity. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p12.34">They may also purchase without any feeling for the brand (e.g. sugar). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p12.34">Analysis also suggests that often brand is not a cause of the purchase, but <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> when shoppers buy easily available brands and in consequence start liking them. </s>
</p>
<p n="p13.34">
<s n="s1.2;p13.34">As Engel (1995) puts it, 'the brand name appears to serve as a surrogate indicator of product quality' and in this respect can also be seen as status symbol. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p13.34">Moreover, Sheth (1999), claims that people tend to identify emotionally with brands and see them as part of themselves. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Store name</head>
<p n="p14.34">
<s n="s1.6;p14.34">At which grocery store do you shop? </s>
<s n="s2.6;p14.34">Do you shop there regularly or occasionally? </s>
<s n="s3.6;p14.34">Why do you shop there rather than at other stores? </s>
<s n="s4.6;p14.34">Are they less convenient? </s>
<s n="s5.6;p14.34">More expensive? </s>
<s n="s6.6;p14.34">Those numerous questions come from extensive study 'Consumer behaviour and beyond', by Sheth (1999) and are exhaustively answered there. </s>
</p>
<p n="p15.34">
<s n="s1.3;p15.34">The number one factor in store choice is location. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p15.34">However, sometimes customers will go to a distant store, if they get better quality or selection or price (Sheth, 1999). </s>
<s n="s3.3;p15.34">Store loyalty depends also on how favourable the shopping experience is in a particular store, which is determined by: (1) the quality of service (2) in-store display; and (3) atmosphere (Sheth, 1999). </s>
</p>
<p n="p16.34">
<s n="s1.2;p16.34">Important for this study is the fact that East (1997) mentions Marks and Spencer as a store credited with strong drawing power. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p16.34">According to this author M&amp;S offers a product range or standard of service that is not easily found in other stores. </s>
</p>
<p n="p17.34">
<s n="s1.2;p17.34">Another attraction for the customer is store brands. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p17.34">Their exclusive availability may be one more source of customer's loyalty (Sheth, 1999), what could be the case as far as Marks and Spencer is concerned. </s>
</p>
</div2>
<div2>
<head rend="bold">Country of product origin</head>
<p n="p18.34">
<s n="s1.3;p18.34">More than twelve years ago, Okechuku (1994), investigated the importance of the product origin to consumers in the United States, Canada, Germany and The Netherlands. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p18.34">This feature was found to be one of the three most important in preference evaluation. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p18.34">Respondents in each country preferred domestically-made products, followed by products made in other developed countries and, lastly, products made in developing countries. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p19.34">This approach is not unfamiliar to Australian customers nowadays. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p19.34">Overall 89% of respondents of a survey carried out by 'Australian Made Campaign', felt it was important to them that the goods or products they purchase are of Australian origin. </s>
