Subject to the rights of the these institutions in the BAWE corpus, and pursuant to the ESRC agreement, the BAWE corpus is available to researchers for research purposes PROVIDED THAT the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The corpus files are not distributed in either their original form or in modified form.</p>
<p>2. The texts are used for research purposes only; they should not be reproduced in teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. The texts are not reproduced in full for a wider audience/readership, although researchers are free to quote short passages of text (up to 200 running words from any given text).</p>
<p>4. The BAWE corpus developers (contact: BAWE@warwick.ac.uk) are informed of all projects, dissertations, theses, presentations or publications arising from analysis of the corpus.</p>
<p>5. Researchers acknowledge their use of the corpus using the following form of words: "The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thompson (Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens (Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC (RES-000-23-0800)."</p>

<p n="p2.16">
<s n="s1.2;p2.16">The equilibrium established between a saturated solution of a slightly soluble salt in contact with excess solid is a heterogeneous one. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p2.16">The product of the concentrations of the cation (M+) and anion (M-) in a saturated solution of a slightly soluble electrolyte is constant at a given temperature (solubility product). </s>
</p>
<p n="p3.16">
<s n="s1.2;p3.16">The relationship between the solubility (molar concentration) and the solubility product (Ks) depends on the charge type of the electrolyte (MX, MX2). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p3.16">Different electrolytes can have differing effects upon solubility; for example an electrolyte that already contains concentrations of the salt cations/anions will lesson the solubility of the respective salt. </s>
</p>
<p n="p4.16">
<s n="s1.1;p4.16">The common ion effect reduces the salt solubility but the solubility product remains unchanged (salting out). </s>
</p>
<p n="p5.16">
<s n="s1.1;p5.16">The addition of "inert" ions increases solubility of a sparingly soluble compound (salting in), this is due to ionic interactions and the effect is calculated via the activity coefficients for each ion. </s>
</p>
<p n="p6.16">
<s n="s1.1;p6.16">For solutions below 0.01M it is fair to dis-regard ionic interactions however more concentrated solutions or were inert salts are present this is not a reasonable assumption. </s>
</p>
<p n="p7.16">
<s n="s1.1;p7.16">Values of activity coefficients are independent of the electrolyte at ionic concentrations below 0.1M, above this concentration values differ. </s>
</p>
<p n="p8.16">
<s n="s1.1;p8.16">The true thermodynamic solubility product, Ks <hi rend="sup">th</hi>, takes into account these mean ionic activity coefficients. </s>

<s n="s1.3;p9.16">In this experiment, the slightly soluble salt is Potassium Periodate. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p9.16">Three saturated solutions are also prepared, one being in pure water, another in a solution containing NaNO3 and our final being in a solution also containing KNO3. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p9.16">The concentration of IO4- in each saturated solution is obtained by converting IO4- to I2 (reduction by acidified I-) followed by titration of the I2 with standard Sodium Thiosulfate. </s>
