<p rend="bulleted" n="p6.29">
<s n="s1.1;p6.29">All are positive results; all solutions in test tubes appear yellow. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p7.29">
<s n="s1.3;p7.29">Standard sample absorbencies are always greater than blank sample absorbencies. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p7.29">This is due to the presence or absence of trypsin: thus a release of p-nitroaniline by BAPNA digestion. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p7.29">Solutions appear yellow. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p8.29">
<s n="s1.2;p8.29">As expected, <hi rend="italic">USa</hi> has only 41% absorbance of <hi rend="italic">Std</hi>, because TI presents. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p8.29">In other words, less than half of the amount of p-nitroaniline is released from successful BAPNA digestion. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p9.29">
<s n="s1.1;p9.29">HSa has the lowest absorbance among the Standard samples, although it expected to be similar to Std because of the denatured IT. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p10.29">
<s n="s1.2;p10.29">All blank samples (standard, heated and unheated) are expected to have very similar absorbencies, because of the absence of trypsin, therefore no successful inhibition even TI presents. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p10.29">Thus no release of yellow p-nitroaniline and results in the lowest sets of absorbencies: StdB, 0.022; USaB, 0.021; except for HSaB, 0.095 (anomalous). </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p11.29">
<s n="s1.3;p11.29">For heated samples, TI is denatured so there is no trypsin inhibition. </s>
<s n="s2.3;p11.29">HSaB (absorbance value = 0.095), which is four times higher the other two blank samples. </s>
<s n="s3.3;p11.29">This is likely due to experimental error. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p12.29">
<s n="s1.1;p12.29">Should really write about the <hi rend="bold">sources of errors</hi> of the high absorbencies, high inhibition % and high TIA of the <hi rend="bold italic">heated</hi> samples. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p13.29">
<s n="s1.4;p13.29">E.g. the incomplete heating of soya meal, thus TI is not completely deactivated - using a test tube. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p13.29">Results show even mild heat (for a short time only. </s>
<s n="s3.4;p13.29">Problem - doesn't know whether it is heated completely, just by the appearance, bubbling.) to IT can still lower the TIA and inhibition %. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p13.29">Improvement (as simple as using a thermometer) needs to be suggested to ensure IT is completely deactivated. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p14.29">
<s n="s1.2;p14.29">From Clara's: partially denatured TI - just heat to boil - for a short time, has a great effect on decreasing inhibition. </s>
<s n="s2.2;p14.29">This can therefore improve the nutritional value of soya bean, by improving the protein quality and being more easily digested and absorbed by the body. </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p15.29">
<s n="s1.2;p15.29">At 100 <hi rend="sup">o</hi>C only 15 min of steaming is required to achieve max. protein efficiency and to inactivate the TI (Rackis 1966). </s>
<s n="s2.2;p15.29">This again proves insufficient heating of soyabean meal in the practical. (<hi rend="bold">100oC for 15min</hi>) </s>
</p>
<p rend="bulleted" n="p16.29">
<s n="s1.2;p16.29">"when moisture of whole soyabeans was raised to 60% or higher by soaking overnight, boiling for only 5 min. is sufficient to denature TI." </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p18.29">
<s n="s1.4;p18.29">Defatted soyabean meal used - Free fatty acids present in soya bean can act as non-specific trypsin inhibitors. </s>
<s n="s2.4;p18.29">So it is essential to remove fat contaminants (in this practical). </s>
<s n="s3.4;p18.29">To obtain a fair test. </s>
<s n="s4.4;p18.29">Otherwise, inhibition caused by those free fatty acids will be measured together with the TI - higher. </s>

<p rend="bulleted" n="p19.29">
<s n="s1.3;p19.29">
<hi rend="bold">Not accurate results for heated samples</hi> - Inhibition % > 40% (literature value?) - Much greater. </s>
