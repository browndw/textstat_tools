## R Markdown Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

This document will generate a PDF when you knit it, as specified by the **output** at the top.

Below is our first code chunk. Note the options. By setting **echo** to *FALSE* the code will not appear in the output. Likewise both **include** and **error** have been set to *FALSE* so that the results of code will be excluded as will any error warnings.

```{r corpus-chunk, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# load the quanteda and tidyverse libraries
library(quanteda)
library(tidyverse)

# save our text
text <- "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

# convert it into a corpus object
small_corpus <- corpus(text)

# tokenize it
small_tokens <- tokens(small_corpus, what = "word", remove_punct = TRUE)

# create a document frequency matrix
small_dfm <- dfm(small_tokens)

# make a table of token counts
token_counts <- textstat_frequency(small_dfm)

token_counts <- token_counts %>% mutate(freq_norm = frequency / sum(frequency))

```

## Including Tables

You can also embed tables. Here, for example, is a table of our token counts (rows 1-5):

```{r freq-table}
knitr::kable(token_counts[1:5, ], caption = 'A caption')
```

## Including Plots

Like tables, you can embed plots. Here is plot of token frequencies generated from the **token_counts** dataframe that we generated in the code chunk above:
```{r, fig-chunk, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=my_cap, fig.align='left', fig.height=2.25}

my_cap <- 'A caption'

ggplot(token_counts, aes(x = reorder(feature, freq_norm), y = freq_norm)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

Note the **fig.cap** option is directed to a string in the code chunk called *my_cap*.

## Your Homework

Fix a few things with the table and figure:

1. Add your name to the header after **author:**
2. The code chunk that is producing the table doesn't need to be visible in the output. Adjust the chunk options so that it's supressed.
3. The captions only have placeholders. Replace those with well-crafted, descriptive captions.
4. The figure's axis labels are not understandable and don't include units. Change the labels accordingly. If you don't know how, you can check here <http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-title-main-axis-and-legend-titles>
5. The figure is also a little ugly. It includes a lot of non-data ink. Clean up the figure and make it a little more readable and better designed. You might start by changing the theme <http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements>
